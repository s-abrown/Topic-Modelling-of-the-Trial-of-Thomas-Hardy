crowd. In this manner they proceeded till
they joined the magistrates, when the mili-
tary returned to the Castle, and then the
procession was conducted in the following
order :—The city constables; town officers
bare-hcaded; bailie Lothian, and bailie Dal-
rymple; Rev. Principal Baird; Mr. Sheriff
Clerk, and Mr. Sheriff Davidson ; a number
of country constables; the hurdle painted
black, and drawo by a white horse; a num-
ber of country constables. The city guard,
lined the streets to keep off the crowd.

* When they hadreached the Tolbooth door,
the prisoner was taken from the hurdle, and
conducied into the prison, where a conside-
rable time was spent in devotional exercises.
The prisoner then came out upon the plat-
form, attended by the magistrates, the she-
tiffs, Principal Baird, &c. Some time was


then spent in prayer and singing psalms;
after ohh ihe poaonet neni. the drop-
beard, and was launched into eternity.

“ When the body was taken down, it was
stretched upon a table, and the executioner,
with two blows of the ase, severed off the
head, which was received into a basket, and
then held up to the multitude, while the
executioner called aloud ‘ This is the head of «
* traitor, and so perish all treitors.’”—New
Ann. Reg., 1794, p. 58. That part of the
sentence which relates to being quartered,
écc. had been previously remitted.

commendation of the jury y whom he was
tried, received his Majesty’s Pardon,

ON the tenth day of September, 1794, a
special commission of Oyer and Terminer
was issued under the Great Seal of Great
Britain to inquire of certain high treasons and
misprisions of treason within the county of
Middlesex.

On Thursday, the second of October, the
special commission was opened at the Session
house in Clerkenwell :

Present,—the right honourable sir James
Eyre, knt., lord chief justice of his majesty’s
court of Common pleas ; the right honguratle
sir Archibald Macdonald, knt. lord chief baron
of his majesty’s court of Exchequer; the ho-
nourable sir Beaumont Hotham, knt. one of
the barons of his majesty’s court of Exche-
quer; the honourable sir Francis Buller, bt.

Common pleas; the honourable sir Nash
Grose, knt. one of the justices of his majesty’s
coutt of King’s-bench; the honourable sir
Soulden Lawrence, knt. one of the justices of
his majesty’s court of King’s-bench; and
others his majesty’s justices, &c,

After the commission had been read, the
sheriff delivered in the panel of the grand
jury, which was called over, when the follow-

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Gentlemen of
the Grand Inquest; — You are assembled
under the authority of the king’s commission,
which has been issued for the hearing and de-
termining of the offences of high treason, and
misprisions of treason against the persun and
authority of the king.

That which hath given occasion for this
commission is that which is declared by a late
statute, namely, “ That a traitorous and de-
testahle conspiracy has heen formed for sub-
verting the existing laws and constitution, and
for introducing the system of many and
confusion, which has so lately prevailed in
France;” acrime of that deep malignity which
loudly calls upon the justice of the nation to
interpose, “ for the better preservation of his
majesty’s sacred person, and for securing the
peace and the laws and liberties of this pa
dom.”

4

The first and effective pt Kea on agin
the ordinary criminal proceedings, is, that a
grand jury of the country should make public
Inquisition for the king, shoutd diligently in-
quire, discover, and bring forward to the view
of the criminal magistrate, those offences
which it is the object of this special commbis-
sion to hear and to determine.

Youare jurors for our sovereign lord the
king; you are so styled in every indictment
which is presented; but let the true nature
of this service be understood. The king com-
mands you to enter upon this inquiry; but
the royal authority in this, as in all its other
functions, is exerted, and operates ultimately
for the benefit of his people. It is the king’s
object, his duty, to vindicate his peace, his
crown, and dignity, because his peace, his
crown, and dignity, are the subjects’ protec-
tion, their security, and their happiness.

It is ultimately for them that the laws have
thrown extraordinary fences around the per-
son and authority of the king, and that all
attempts against the one or the other are con-
sidered a3 the highest crimes which can be
committed, and are punished with a severity
which rothing but the salus populi can
justify. :

The business of this day calls upon me (in
order that you may the better understand the
subject which is to come before you) to open
to you the nature of that offence, which I have
before spoken of in general.

An ancient statute, 25 Edward Srd, has de-
clared and defined it. I shall state to you so
yauch of that declaration and definition as ap-
pears to me to have any probable relation to
the business of this day.

By that statute it is declared to he high trea-
son to compass or imagine the death of the
king, provided such compassing and imagi-
nation be manifested by some act or acts
proved (by two witnesses) to have been done

y the party accused in prosecution of that
compassing and imagination; that is, from
the moment that this wicked imagination of
the heart is acted upon, that any steps are
taken in any manner conducing to the bring-
ing about and effecting the design, the inten-
tion becomes the crime, and the measure of
it is full.

These acts or steps are technically deno-
minated overt acts; and the forms of pro-
ceeding in cases of this nature, tequire that
these overt acts should be particularly set
forth in every indictment of treason; and,
from the nature of them, they must consti-
tute the principal head of inquiry for the grand
jury.

‘These overt acts involve them in two
distinct considerations; 1st, the matter of
fact, of which they consist; in the next
place, the relation of that fact tu the design.

With respect to the mere miatter of fact, it
willbe for the grand jury to inquire into the
true state of it; and I can have very little to
offer to your consideration respecting it: and,


with respect to the question, whether the fact
has relation to the design, so ss to constitute
an overt act of this species of treason, which:
involves considerations botly of fact and of haw,
it is impossible that any certain rule should be
laid down for your government ; overt acts
being in their nature all the possible means
which may be used in the prosecution of the
end proposed; they can be no otherwise
defined, aod must remain for ever infnitely
various.

Thus far, I can inform you: that occasions
have unhappily, but too frequently, brought
overt acts of this species of treason under com
sideration; in consequence of which we are
furnished with judicial opinions upon man
of them? and we are also furnished with epi-
nions (drawn from these sources) of text
writers—some of the wisest and most enlight-
ened men of their time, whose integrity has
Leen always considered as the most promi-
nent feature of their character, and whose
doctrines do now form great land-marks, b:
which posterity will be enabled to trace, wit!
@ great degree of certainty, the boundary
lines between high treason, and offences of a
lower order and degree.

It is a fortunate circumstance that we are
thus assisted; for it is not to be dissembled
that, though the crime of high treason is
“ the greatest crime against faith, duty, and
human society,” and though, “ the public is
deeply interested in every prosecution of this
kind well founded,” there hath been, in the
best times, a considerable degree of jealousy
on the subject of prosecutions for high trea-
son ; they are state prosecutions, and the con-
sequences to the party accused are penal in
the extreme.

Jurors and judges ought to feel an extradrdi-
nary anxiety that prosecutions of this nature
should proceed upon solid grounds. I can
easily conceive, therefore, that it must be a
great relief to jurors placed in the responsible
situation in which you now stand bound tode
justice to their country and to the persons
accused, and anxious to discharge this trust
faithfully ; sure I am that it is consolation and-
comfort to us, whe have upon us the respori-
sibility of declaring what the law is, in cases
in which the public and the individual are so
deeply interested; to have such men as the
great sir Matthew Hale, and an eminent judge
of our own times, who, with the experience
of acentury concurs with him in opinion, sir
Michael Foster, for our guides.

To proceed by steps: from these writers
upon the law of treason (who speak, as I
have before observed, upon the authority of ad-
judged cases) we learn, that not only acts of
immediate aud direct attempt against the
king's life are overt acts of compassing hit
death, but that all the remoter steps, taken
with a view to assist, to bring about the actual
attempt, are equally overt acts of this species
of treason ; even the ineeting and the consult-
ing whet steps should be taken in order to

bring about the end proposed, has been always
deemed to be an act done in prosecution of
the design, and as such an overt act of this
treason—This is our first step in the present
inquiry. I proceed to observe that the overt
acts I have been nqw speaking of have refer-

ence, nearer or more remote, to a direct and im-
mediate attempt upon the life of the king; but
that the same authority informs us that they
who aim directly at the life of the king (such,
for instance, as the persons who were con-
cerned in the assassination plot, in the vag
of king William) are not the only persons who
can be said to compass or imagine the death
of the king. The entering into measures
which, in the nature of things, or in the com-
mon experience of mankind, do obviously tend
to bring the life of the king into danger, is
also compassing and imagining the death of
the king; and the measures which are taken
will be at once evidence of the compassing,
and overt acts of it,

The instances which are put by sir Matthew
Hale and sir Michael Foster (and upon which
there have been adjudged cases) are of conspi-
tacies to depose the king; to imprison him ;
to get his person into the power of the conspi-
rators ; to procure an invasion of the kingdom.
The first of these, apparently the strongest
case, and coming the nearest to the direct at-
tempt against the life of the king; the last,
the farthest removed from that direct attempt,
but being a measure tending to destroy the
public peace of the country to introduce hos-
tilities, and the Benessily of resisting force by
force, and where it is obvious, that the con-
flict has an ultimate tendency to bring the

rson and life of the king into jeopardy; it
1s taken’ to be a sound construction of the
statute 25 Edward Srd, and the clear law of
the land, that this is also compassing and
imagining the death of the king.

_ If a conspiracy to depose or to imprison
the king, to get his person into the power-of
the conspirators, or to procure an invasion of
the kingdom, involves in it the compassing
and imagining of his death and if steps taken
in prosecution of such a conspiracy are rightly
deemed overt acts of the treason of imaginin,
and compassing the king’s death: need Ladd,
that if it should appear that it has entered
into the heart of any man who is a subject of
this country, to design, to overthrow the
whole government of the country, to pull
down and to subvert from its very foundations
the British monarchy, that glorious fabric
which it has been the work of ages to erect,
maintain and support, which has been ce-
mented with the best blood of our ancestors ;
to design such a horrible ruin and devastation,
which no king could survive, a crime of such
@ magnitude that no lawgiver in this country
hath ever ventured to contemplate itinits whole
extent; need I add, I say, that the complica-
tion and the enormous extent of such a de-
sign will not prevent its being distinctly seen,
that the compassing and imaginipg the death


of the king is involved in it, is, in truth, of
its very essence.

This is too plain a case to require farther
illustration from me. If any man of plain
sense, but not conversant with subjects of
this nature, should feel himself disposed to
ask whether a conspiracy of this nature is to
be reached by this medium only; whether it
is a specific treason to compass and imagine
the death of the king, and not a specific trea-
son to conspire to subvert the monarchy
itself; I answer, that the statute of Edward
Srd, by which we are governed, hath not
declared this (which in all just theory of
treason is the greatest of all treasons) to be
high treason.

said no lawgiver had ever ventured : to
contemplate it in its whole extent; the seditio
regni, spoken of by some of our ancient
writers, comes the nearest to it, but falls far
short of it; perhaps if it were now a question
whether ick a conspiracy should be made a
specific treason, it might be argued to be un-
necessary : that in securing the person and
authority of the king from all danger, the
monarchy, the religion and laws of our country -
are incidentally secured ; that the constitution
of our government is so framed, that the
imperial crown of the realm is the common
centre of the whole; that all traitorous at-
tempts upon any part of it are instantly
communicated to that centre, and felt there ;
and that, as upon every principle of public
policy and justice they are punishable as
traitorous attempts against the king’s person
or authority, and will, according to the parti-
cular nature of the traitorous attempt, fall
within one or other of the specific treasons
against the king, declared by the statute of
25 Edward Srd ; this greatest of all treasons is
sufficiently provided against by law.

Gentlemen, I presume, I hardly need give
you this caution, that though it has been ex-
pressly declared, by the highest authority,
that there do exist in this country men capable
of meditating the destruction of the constitu-
tion under which we live; that declaration,
being extrajudicial, is not a ground upon which
you ought to proceed.

In consequence of that declarationit became
a public and indispensable duty of his majesty .
to institute this solemn proceeding, and to
impose upon you the painful task of examin- -
ing the accusations which shall be brought
before you; but it will be your duty to ex-
amine them in a regular judicial course, that
is, by hearing the evidence, and forming your -
own judgment upon it. -

And here, as I do not think it necessary to
trouble you with observations upon the other
branches of the statute 25 Edward $rd, the
charge to the grand inquest might conclude ;
had not the particular nature of the conspiracy,
alleged to have been formed against the
state, been disclosed, and made matter of -
public notoriety by the reports of the two

jouses of parliament, now in every one’s .

hands: but that being the case, I am appre-
hensive that I shall not be thought to have
fulfilled the duty, which the judge owes to
the grand jury, when questions in the criminal
law arise on new and extraordinary cases of
fact, if I did not plainly and distinctly state
what I conceive the law to be, or what doubts
I conceive may arise in law, upon the facts
which are likely to be laid before you, accord-
ing to the different points of view in which
those facts may appear to you.

It is matter of public notoriety that there
‘have been associations formed in this county,
and in other parts of the kingdom, the pro-
fessed purpose of which has been a change in
the constitution of the Commons House of
Parliament, and the obtaining of annual par-
liaments; and that to some of these associa-
tions other purposes, hidden under this veil,

“purposes the most traitorous, have been
imputed; and that some of these associations
have been supposed to have actually adopted
measures of such a nature, and to have gone
into such excesses, as will amount to the crime
of high treason.

If there be ground to consider the professed
purpose of any of these associations, a reform
in parliament, as mere colour, and as a pretext
held out in order to cover deeper designs—
designs against the whole constitution and
government of the country ; the case of those
embarked in such designs is that which I
have already considered. Whether this be
s0, or not, is mere matter of fact; as to which
I shall only remind you, that an inquiry into
acharge of this nature, which undertakes to
make out that the ostensible purpose is a
mere veil, under which is concealed a trai-
torous conspiracy, requires cool and deliberate
examination, and the most attentive conside-
ation ; and that the result should be perfectly
elear and satisfactory. In the affairs of com-
mon life, no man is justified in imputing to
another a meaning contrary to what he himself
expresses, but upon the fullest evidence. On
the other hand, where the charge can be
made out, it is adding to the crime meditated
the deepest dissimulation and treachery, with
respect to those individuals, who may be
drawn in to embark in the ostensible purpose,
as well as to the public, against which this
dark mystery of wickedness is fabricated.

But if we suppose these associations to
adhere to the professed purpose, and to have
no other primary object, it may be asked, is it
possible, and (if it be possible) by what pro-
cess is it, that an association for the reform of
pavement can work itself up to the crime of

high treason? All men may, nay, all men

must, if they possess the faculty of thinking,
reason upon every thing which sufficiently
interests them to become objects of their
attention, and among the objects of the atten-
tion of free men, the principles of govern-

-ment, the constitution of particular govern-
ments, and, above all, the constitution of the
overmment under which they live, will natu-

«


rally engage attention, and provoke speculg-
tion. The power of communication of thoughts
and opinionsisthe gift of God, and the freedons
of it is the source of all science, the first fruits
and the ultimate happiness of society ; and
therefore it seems to fallow, that human laws
ought not to interpose, nay, cannot interpose,
to prevent the communication of sentiments
and opinions in voluntary assemblies of men;
all which is true, with this single reservation,
that those assemblies are to be so composed,
and so conducted, as not to endanger the
public peace and good order of the government
under which they live; and I shall not state
to you that associations and assemblies of
men, for the purpose of obtaining a reform in
the interior constitution of the British parlia-
ment, are simply unlawful; but, on the other
hand, I must state to you, that they may but
too easily degenerate, and become unlawful,
in the highest degree, even to the enormous
extent of the crime of high treason. i

The process is very simple: let us imagine
to ourselves this case: a few well meaning
men conceive that they and their fellow
subjects labour under some grievance; they
assemble peaceably to deliberate on the means
of obtaining redress; the numbers increase ;
the discussion grows animated, eager, and
violent ; a rash measure is proposed, adopted
and acted upon; who can say where this shall
stop, and that these men, who originally
assembled peaceably, shall not finally, and
suddenly too, involve themselves in the crime
of high treason? It is apparent how easily
an impetuous man may precipitate such as-
semblies into crimes of unforeseen magnitude,
and danger to the state; but, let it con-
sidered, that bad men may also find their way
into such assemblies, and use the innocent
purposes of their association as the stalking

jorse to their purposes of a very different
complexion. How easy for such men to
practise upon the credulity and the enthusiasm
of honest men, lovers of their country, loyal
to their prince, but eagerly bent upon some
speculative improvements in the frame, and
internal mechanism of the government? If
we suppose bad men to have once gained an
corenitice in an assembly of this description,
popular in its constitution, and having popular
objects ; how easy is it for such men to plunge
such an assembly into the most criminal ex-
cesses? Thus far I am speaking in general,
merely to illustrate the proposition, that men
who assemble in order to procure a reform of
parliament may involve themselves in the
guilt of high treason.

The notoriety to which I have alluded leads
me to suppose, that the project of a convention
of the people to be assembled under the
advice and direction of some of these societies,
or of delegations from them, will be the lead-
ing fact, which will be laid before you in evi-
dence, respecting the conduct, and measures
of these associations; a project, which. per-
haps, in better times, would baye been hardly

thought worthy of gas consideration; but,
in these our days, having been attempted to
be put in execution in a distant part of the
united kingdoms, and, with the example of a
neighbouring country before our eyes; is
deservedly become an object of the jealousy
of our laws: it will be your duty to examine
the evidence on this head very carefully, and
to sift it to the bottom ; to consider every part
of it in itself, and as it stands connected with
other parts of it, and to draw the conclusion
of fact, as.to the existence, the nature, and
the object of this project of a convention,
from the whole.

In the course of the evidence you will pro-
bably hear of bodies of men having been col-
Lectesl soxethies, of violent resolutions voted at
these and at other meetings, of some prepara-
tion of offensive weapons, and of the adoption
ofthe language, and manner of proceeding of
those conventions in France, which have pos-
sessed themselves of the government of that
country: I dwell not on these particulars,
because I consider them, not as substantive
treasons, but, as circumstances of evidence,
tending to ascertain the true nature of the
object which these persons had in view, and

the true nature of this project of a con-
vention, and to be considered by you in the
mass of that evidence; which evidence it
floes not fall within the province of the charge
to, consider. in detail; my present duty is, to
inform you what the law is upon the matter of
fact, which in your judgment shall be the
result of the evidence.

i presume that I have sufficiently explained
to you, that a project to bring the people
togetber in convention, in imitation of those
national conventions. which we have heard of
in France, in order to usurp the government
of the country, and any one step taken towards
bringing it about, such as, for-instance, con-
sultations, forming of committees to con-
sider ef the means, acting in those committees,
swould,be a case of no difficulty that it would
be the cheateat, Hight treason 3 i woul be
compassing and imagining the king’s death,
and not only his ent; t the asks and
destruction of all order, religion, laws, all
pro , all security for the lives and liberties
of tl king's subjects.

That which remains to be considered is,
the project of a convention having for its sole
object the effecting a change in the mode of

tation of the le in parliament,
and the obtaining that parliaments should be
held. annually; and here there is room to
distinguish. Such a project of a convention,
aaking it to be criminal, may be criminal in
different degrees, according to the case in
evidence, ‘from whence you are-to collect the
drue nature and extent of the , and the
manner in-which it is inte’ to operate ;
and it will become a question of great impor-
ome under what class ef crimes it-ought to

ln eeialnibe upon. the-complexion and


wality af this project of @ convention,

til lay down to yourselves one praciple
which is never to be departed from, : that
alterations.in the representation of the people
in parliament, or in the law for holding par-
liaments, can only be effected by the muthictty
of the King, Lords, and Commons, in parlia-
ment assembled. This being taken as a foun-
dation, it seems to follow as a necessary
consequence, that a project of a convention,
which should have for its object the obtaining
@ parliamentary reform without the authority
of parliament, and steps taken upon it, would
be high treason in all the actors in it; for this
is a conspiracy to overturn the government.
The gocrament cannot be said to exist, if
the functions of legislation are usu! fora
moment; and it then becomes of little con-
Sequence indeed, that the original conspira-
tors, perhaps, had only meditated a plan of
moderate reform : it is in the.nature of things,
that the power should go out of their hands,
and be Beyond the reach of their control.
A conspiracy of this nature is therefore, at
best, a conspiracy to overturn the govern-
‘ment, in order to new model it, which is, in
effect, to introduce anarchy, and that which
anarchy may chance to settle down into ;
after the king may have been brought to the
scaffold, and after the country may have
suffered all the miseries which discord and
civil war shall have produced.

Whether the project of a. convention, hay-
.ing for its object the collecting together a
power which should overawe the legislative
body, and extort a parliamentary reform from
it, if acted upon, will also amount to high
treason, and to the specific treason of com-
passing and imagining the king's death, is a
more doubtful question. Thus far is clear;
a force upon the parliament must.be immedi-
ately directed against the king, who is an in-
tegral part of it; it mugchreset the king, or it
can have no effect at all. Laws are enacted
in parliament by the king’s majesty, by and
with the advice and consent of the pee and
Commons, in parliament assembled. A force
meditated against the parliament, is therefore
a force meditated against the king, and seezns
to fall within the case of a force meditated
against the king, to compel him to ‘alter the
measures of his government: but, in that
case, it does not appear to.me that lam war-
ranted by the authoritics to state to you, as
clear law, that the mere conspiracy to raise
such a force, and the gntering into consulta-
tions respecting -it, will alone, and without
actually raising the force, constitute the crime
of high treason. What the law is in that
case, and what will be the effect of the cir-
cumstance of the force being meditated agai
the king in parliament, against the king an
the exercise of the royal function in a -point
which is of the very essence of his monarchy,
will be fit to be.solemaly considered, and <de-
termined when the case shall arise,

‘It may be stated toyouasclear, that the pro-
ject of a convention, having for its sole object a
dutiful and peaceable application to the wisdom
of parliament on the subject of a wished-for
¥eform, which application should be entitled
to weight and credit from the universality of
-t, but should still leave to the parliament the
freest exercise of its discretion to grant or to
refuse the prayer of the petition (great as the
responsibility will be on the persons concern-
ed in it, in respect of the many probable, and
all the possible, bad consequences of collect-
ing a great number of people together, with
Noo specific legal powers to be exercised, and
under no government but that of their own
discretion), cannot in itself merit to be ranked
among that class of offences which we are
now assembled to hear and determine.

Upon this last statement of the fact of the
ease, Fam not called upon, and therefore it
-would not be proper for me to say more.

Gentlemen, you will now proceed upon the
several articles of inquiry, which have been

ven you in charge; if you find that the par-~
ties, who shall be accused before you, have
been pursuing lawful ends by lawful means,
or have been only indiscreet, or at the worst if
eriminal, that they have not been criminal to
the extent of those treasons to which our in-
quiries are confined, then say, that the bills
which shall be presented to you are not true
bills; but, if any of the accused persons shalt
appear to you to have been engaged in that
traitorous and detestable conspiracy described
in the preamble of the late statute ; or, if with-
out any formed design to go the whole length
of that conspiracy, they have yet acted upon
the desperate imagination of bringing about
alterations in the constitution of the commons |

‘house of parliament, or in the manner of |
holding parliaments without the authority of
parliament, and, in defiance of it, by an usurp-
power, which should, in that instance,
suspend the lawful authority of the king, )
Jords, and commons, in parliament assembled,
_ and take upon itself the fanction of legisla-
- tion (which imagination amounts to a eonspi-
racy to subyert the exisiing laws and consti-
tution, differing from the former only in the
extent of its object), you will then do that
which belongs to your office to do.

In the third view of the case of the aceused
persons; that is, if you find them involved in,
and proceeding upon, a design to collect the
people together against the legislative autho-

rity of the country, for the purpose, not of
asurping the functions of the legislature, but
of overawing the parliament, and so compel-
ling the king, lords, and commons, in par- !
Hiament assembled, to enact a law for new
modelling the commons house of parliament,
or for holding annual parliaments; and that
charges of high treason are offered to be main-
tained agaiust them upon this ground only:
perhaps it may be fitting that, in respect of
the extraurdinary nature and dangerous ex-
tent and very criminal complexion of such a
conspiracy, that case, which J state to you as


a new and 8 doubtful case, should be put into’
a judicial course of inquiry, that it may receive
a solemn adjudication, Meher will, or will

the bills must be found to be true bills.

Gentlemen, I have not opened to you the
law of misprision of treason, because I am
not aware that there are any commitments
for that offence ; and therefore I have no rea
som to suppose that there will be any prose-
cution for that offence. It consists of the
concealment of treason committed by others
(which undoubtedly it is every man’s duty to
disclose), and the punishment is extremely
severe; but the humanity of modern times
hath usually interposed, and I trust that the
necessities of the present hour will not de-
mand, that the law of misprision of treason’
should now be carried into execution.

Gentlemen, I dismiss you with confident
expectation that your judgment will be direct-
ed to those conclusions which may clear in-
nocent men from all suspicion of guilt, bring
the guilty to condign punishment, préserve
the life of our gracious sovereign, secure the
stability of our government, abd maintain the
public peace, in which comprehensive term is

* Immediately after the publication of this
charge, appeared a short examination of the
doctrines maintained in it, under the title of
“ Cursory Strictures on the Charge delivered
by lord chief justice Eyre to the Grand
Jury, October 2, 1794.” This tract, although
now somewhat scarce, drew much attention,
and excited much interest at the time ; I have
sufficient authority for stating that it was com-
posed by the late Mr. Felix Se ye who it
will be observed was appointed counsel for’
one of the persons arraigned, and who acted
as aasintantt counsel on his and the following
trial.

Upon this occasion a charge was delivered to
the grand jury, by sir James Eyre, lord chief
justice of the court of Common Pleas.

Itis one of the first privileges ot’ an English-
man, one of the first duties of a rational be-
ing, to discuss with pertect freedom, all prin-
ciples proposed to be enforced upon general
observance, when those principles are first
disclosed, and before they have yet, by any
solemn and final proceeding, been made part
ofa regular catablished system. The chief
justice, in his charge to the jury, has delivered
many new and extraordinary doctrines upon
the subject of treason. These doctrines, now

it is fit we should examine. In that exami-
nation, I shall deliver my opinions in a man-
ner perfectly frank and explicit. No man
should seek to offend high authorities and
elevated magistracy ; but the object before us
is of an importance paramount to these con-
siderations. Decorum is an excellent thing ;
but we ought not to sacrifice to the fastidious
refinements of decorum, all that is most firm
in security, or most estimable in social insti-
tution.

The chiefjustice has promised a publication
of his charge, and I should have been glad to
have waited for the opportunity of an authen-
ticcopy. But thereare onlya few days remain-
ing previous to the commencement of trials,
of the highest expectation, and most unlimited
importance. He who thinks, as I think, that
the best principles of civil government, and
all that our ancestors most affectionately
Joved, are struck at in the most flagrant man-
ner in this charge, will feel that there is not
an hour to be lost. While I animadvert

that I shall reflect upon the possibility of the
enormities being aggravated or created by the
imperfect and irregular form of the publica-
tion before me. Every friend of his country
will participate the Bigbeat satisfaction, at
finding them answered, by a regular publica-
tion of the charge to the grand jury, stripped
of the illegal and destructive doctrines that
now appear to pollute it.

Among the various branches of the English
constitution that have for centuries been a
topic of unbounded praise, there is none, that
has been more, or more deservedly, applauded,
than that which relates to the law of treason.
“The crime of igh treason,” says chief jus-
tice Eyre,* “though the greatest crime against
faith, duty, and human socicty, and though
the public is deeply interested in every well-
founded prosecution of this kind, has yet, at
the best times, been the object of consider-
able jealousy, in respect of the prosecutions
instituted against it; they are state prosecu-
tions.” Itis therefore of the utmost conse-
quence, that the crime of high treason should
be clearly defined, and the exquisite jea-
Jousy allayed, which must otherwise arise in
every benevolent mind. This has been done

by the act 25 Edward Srd, one of the great
ladiums of the English constitution. ‘This
law has been sanctioned by the experience of
more than four centuries; and, though it has
been repeatedly attacked by the encroach-
ments of tyrannical princes, and the decisions
of profligate judges, Englishmen have always
found it necessary in the sequel to strip it of
mischievous appendages and artificial glosses
and restore it to its original simplicity and tus
tre. By this law all treason, exclusively ofa
few articles of little general concern, is con-
fined to the ‘levying war against the king
within the realm, and the compassing or
imagining the death of the king.’ Nay, the
wise framers of the law were not contented to
stop here: they not only shut out the mis-
chief of arbitrary and constructive treason for
themselves, but inserted a particular clause,
roviding that ¢ if in any future time it might
necessary to declare any new treasons, that
should only be done by a direct proceeding of
parliament for that special purpose.’ ”

It is obvious upon the face of this wise and
moderate law, that it made it extremely difi-
cult for a bad king, or an unprincipled admi-
nistration, to gratify their resentment against
a@ pertinacious opponent by instituting against
him a charge of treason. Such kings and
ministers would not fail to complain, that the
law of Edward 3rd shut up the crime within
too narrow bounds ; that a subtle adversary
of the public peace would easily evade these
gross and palpable definitions; and that
crimes of the highest magnitude, and most
dangerous tendency, might be committed,
which could never be brought under these
dry, short, and inflexible classes. It is not to
be denied, that some mischief might arise
from so careful, lenient, and unbloody a pro-
vision. No doubt offences might be con-
ceived, not less dangerous to the public wel-
fare, than those described in the act under
consideration. But our ancestors exposed
themselves to this inconvenience, and tound
it by no means such as was hard to be borne.
They experienced a substantial benefit, a
proud and liberal security, arising out of this
Statute, which amply cumpensated for the
mischief of such subterfuges as might occa-
sionally be employed by a few insignificant
criminals, If we part with their wisdom and
policy, let us beware that we do not substitute
a mortal venom in its stead.

The chief justice has thought proper to
confine himself to that article of the statute
of king Edward Srd which treats of “ compas-
sing and imagining the death of the king.”
This compassing and imagining he very pro-
perly observes, “ requires that jt should be
manifested by overt acts;” and he adds,

The bill ofindictment was not found against

«¢ that they who aim directly at the life of the
king, are not the only persons, who may be
said’ tocompass or imagine his death. The
entering into measures, which in the nature
ef things do obviously tend to bring the life
of the king into danger, is also compassin
and imagining the death of the king; an
the measures which are taken, will be at once
evidence of the compassing and overt acts of
it. The instances which are put under this
head by sir Michael Foster and sir Matthew
Hale, and upon which there have been ad-
judged cases, are [principally four, viz.] of a
conspiracy to depose the king, to imprison
hin, to get his person into the power of the
conspirators, and to procure an invasion of
the kingdom.” He farther states, “ that oc-
casions have unhappily, but too frequently
brought overt acts of this species of treason
under consideration, in consequence of which
we are furnished with judicial opinions upon
many of them. We are also furnished with
opinions drawn from these sources, ef text
writers, some of the wisest and most enlight-
ened men of their time, whose intcgrity has
always been considered as the most prominent
feature of their character, and whose doctrines
do now form great land marks, by which pos-
terity will be enabled to trace with consider-
able certainty the boundary line between high
treason, and offences of a lower order and de-
gree. Itis a fortunate circumstance,” con-
tinues the chief justice, “ that we are thus as-
sisted. I can easily conceive that it must be
a great relief to jurors, placed in the responsi-
ble situation in which you now stand; and
sure I am that it is a consolation and comfort
to us, who have upon us the responsibility of
declaring what the law is, in cases in which
the public and the @ndividual are so deeply
interested.”

In all this preamble of the chief justice,
there is certainly something extremely hu-
mane and conmuletate. I trace init the lan-
guage of a constitutional lawyer, a sound lo-
gician, and a temperate, discreet, and honest
man. I see rising to my view by just degrees
ajudge resting upon the law as it is, and de-
terminedly setting his face against new, un-
preceentes and temporizing constructions.

saps the vitals of human liberty and human
happiness, be he printer, or be he judge, it is

and expose his sophistries.

Chief Justice Eyre, after having stated the
treasons which are most strictly within the
act of Edward 3rd, as well as those which are
sanctioned by high law authorities, and upon
which there have been adjudged cases, pro-
ceeds to reason in the following manner ;

“ If a cunspiracy to depose or imprison the
king, to get his person into the power ot the
conspirators, or procure an invasion of the
kingdom, involves in it the compassing and
imagining his death, and if steps taken in
prosecution of such a conspiracy, are rightly.
deemed overt acts of the treason of compas~
sing the king’s death, what ought to be our
judgment, if it should appear that'it had en-
tered into the heart of any man, who is a sub-
ject of this country, to design to overthrow the
whole government of the country, to pull
down and to subvert from its very foundations
the British monarchy, that glorious fabric,
which it has been the work of ages to erect,
maintain, and support; which has been ce-
mented with the best blood of our ancestors 5
to design such a horrible ruin and devastation,
which no king could survive.” | .

Here. we are presented with-a question
which is no doubt of the utmost itude
and importance. Is the proceeding thus de-
scribed matter of high treason, or is it not?
It confessedly does not come within the letter
of 25 Edward Srd. It does not come within
the remoter instances “ upon which there
have been adjudged cases.” Chief Justice
Eyre has already enumerated these, and, ha-
ving finished that part of his subject, gone on
to something confessedly different.

Are we reasoning respecting law, or re~
specting a state of society, which, having no
fixed rules of law, is obliged to consult the
dictates of its own discretion? Plainly the
former. It follows, therefore, that the aggrae
vations collected by the chief justice, are to-
tally foreign to the question he had to con-
sider. Let it be granted, that the crime, in
the eye of reason and discretion, is the most
enormous, that it can enter into the heart of

man to conceive, still I shall have a right to
ask is it a crime against law? Show me the
statute that describes it; refer me to the pre-
cedent by which it is defined ; quote me the
adjudged case in which a matter of such un-
paralleled magnitude is settled.

- Let us know the ground upon which we
stand. Are we to understand that, under
chief justice Eyre, and the other judges of the
special commission, reasonings are to be ad-
duced from the axioms and dictums of moral-
ists and metaphysicians, and that men are to
be convicted, sentenced, and executed, upon
uhese? Are we to understand that hence-
forth the man most deeply read in the laws
of his country, and most assiduously conform
ing his actions to them, shall be liable to be
arraigned and capitally punished fora crime
that no law describes, that no precedent or
adjudged case ascertains, at the arbitrary
pleasure of the administration for the time

ing? Such a miserable miscellany of law
and metaphysical maxims, would be ten thou-
sand times worse, than if we bad no law to
direct our actions. The law in that case
would be a mere trap to delude us to our ruin
greating a fancied security, an apparent clear-
ness and definition, the better to cover the
concealed pitfalls with which we are on eyery
side surrounded.

- The chief justice is by no means unaware
of the tremendous consequences that would
result from such an administration of criminal
Jaw. He speaks respecting it, when the sub-
ject is first started, with great temperance
and caution. He says, “ That the crime of
conspiring to overthrow the monarchy, is
such an one, as no lawgiver in this conn
has ever ventured to contemplate in its whole
extent. Ifany man of plain sense, but not
conversant with subjects of this nature, should
feel himself disposed to ask, whether a con-
spiracy of this extraordinary nature is to be
teached by the statute of treasons, whether it
is a specific treason to compass and imagine
the death of the king, and not a specitic trea-
son to conspire to subvert the monarchy it-
self? I answer, that the statute of Edward 3rd.
‘by which we are bound, has not declari
this, which undoubtedly in all just theory of
treason is the greatest of all treasons, to be a
specific high treason. I said, no lawgiver had
ever ventured to contemplate it in its whole
extent.” ‘

The language here employed is no doubt
manly and decisive. From hence it follows,
with the most irresistible evidence, that that
‘‘ which the statute by which we are bound,
has not declared to be treason,” that “ which
no lawgiver has ever ventured to contem-
plate,” can never be construed into treason,

No author has reasoned with greater aceu-
racy, and in a more satisfactory manner upom
this important branch of the English constita-
tion than the celebrated David Hume, in his
History of England. This author is well
known to have been sufficiently favourable to
the prerogative, yet his reasonings upon this
subject, in the case of lord Strafforde, are as
minutely applicable to the case before us, a9
if he had written them with the proceedings
of the special commission of October, 1794,
lying before him upon his table.

“© Ofall species of guilt, the law of England
has, with the most scrupulous exactness, de-
fined that of treason; because on that side it
was found most necessary to protect the sub-
ject against the violence of the king and of
his ministers. In the famous statute of Ed-
ward Srd, all the kinds of treasons are enume-
rated; and every other crime, beside such as
are there expressly mentioned, is care!
excluded from that appellation. But wi
regard to this guilt. An endeavour to subvert
the fundamental laws, the statute of treason is
totally silent; and arbitrarily to introduce it
into the fatal catalogue, is itself a subversion
ofall law; and, under colour of defending li-
berty, reverses a statute the best calcul
for the security of liberty, that was ever enact-
liy. p. 403.

The following are a few sentences from the
defence of lord Strafforde, as quoted by Mr.
Hume, a nobleman, whom the republicans of
that time so vehemently hated, and were so
fixed to destroy, as to render them little scru~
rou of overstepping the simple and up;

ending provisions of the law.
“ ere has this species of guilt lain sq
long concealed? Where has this fire been
so long buried, during so many centuri
that no smoke should appear till it burst ou!
at once to consume me and my children?
Better it were to live under no law at all, and,
by the maxims of cautious prudence, to con-
form ourselves the best we can to the arbi-
trary will of a master, than fancy we have s
law on which we can rely, and tnd at last,
that this law shall inflicta punishment prece-
dent to the promulgation, and try us hy max-
ims unheard of till the very moment of the
prosecution, Where is the mark set u
this crime? | Where the token by which I
should discover it? It has lain concealed ;
and no human prudence, no human innocence,
could save me from the destruction with
which I am at present threatened.”

they were, in these killing and destructive
arts! To all my afBictions add not this, my

id.

Chief Justice Free charge consists of three
parts. The first five pages contain principally
a sound and constitutional exposition of the
Jaw of treason, as exhibited in the books. In!
the two following pages we are presented with
this portentous speculation, this new treason
of “conspiring to subvert the monarchy ;”
though the chief justice, as has already appear-
ed, has qualified his speculation, with expres-
sions, proving, by accumulated evidence, and
in the most precise terms, that this new ima-
ginary treason is no treason by the laws of

gland

Here, as the chief justice observes, the
charge might have concluded. Here, if a
proper regard had been paid to the essential
principles of criminal justice, it would have
concluded; if not in reality a little sooner.
The remainder of the charge is made up of hy-
pothesis, presumption, prejudication, and con-
Jecture. There is scarcely a single line that
is not deformed with such phrases as “ public
notoriety,” “things likely,” “purposes im-
puted,” “ measures supposed,” and “ imagin-

cases.”

The plain reason of all this is, that the
chief justice suspected, that the treason de-
scribed in the statute 25 Edward Srd, and
those founded upon precedent, or deducible
from adjudged cases, even with the addition
of the chief justice’s new constructive treason,
founded, as te confesses, upon no law, prece-
dent, or case, and which therefore is in reality
Ro treason, did not afford sufficient ground of
crimination against the prisoners. He is
therefore obliged to leave the plain road, and
travel out of the record. No law, no deduc-
tion, or construction of law, that could be for-
ced or drawn out of a mere view of the sta-
tute, would answer the purposes of the spe-
cial commission. He is therefore obliged to
indulge himself in conjecture, as to what the
Prisoners may have done, and what are

the facts likely to be laid before the jury.”
Two ferent iniquities are included in this
mode of preceeding. First, the chief justice
implicitly confesses himself unable, by direct

luctions of law, to show us what it is we
ought to avoid, and is reduced to the neces-
ay of reasoning, not forward from general
s of action to the guilt or innocence of
Particular men, but backward ffom actions al-

ready performed to the question, whether or
no they shall fall under such or such provi-
sions of law. Secondly, by this perverted
mode of proceeding, he completely prejudges
the case of the prisoners. He does not pro-
ceed, as a judge ought to proceed, by explain-
ing the law, and leaving the grand jury to fix
its application upon individuals; but leads
them to the selection of the individuals them-
selves, and centres in his own person the pro-
vinces of judge and accuser. It may be
doubted whether, in the whole records of the,
legal proceedings of England, another in-
stance is to be found, of such wild conjecture,
such premature presumption, imaginations so
licentious, and dreams so full of sanguinary
and tremendous prophecy.

The conjectures of the chief justice respect-
ing the protable guilt of the accused fall un-
dertwo heads. First, “ associations, the pro-
fessed purpose of which has been a change in
the constitution of the Commons House of
Parliament, and the obtaining of Annual par-
liaments.” Secondly, “ the project of a con-
vention to be assembled under the advice and
direction of some of these associations.”

The treasons which the chief justice ima-
gines himself capable of fixing upon some of
these associations for a parliamentary reform,
are of two kinds.

Before we enter upon these, let us pause a
moment, and consider the unexplored country
before us. Every paragraph now presents us
with a new treason, real or imaginary, pre-
tendedly direct, or avowedly constructive,
Division and subdivision rise upon us, and al-
most every one is concluded with the awful
denunciation of treason. The chief justice
is no longer contented with the plain treasons
of 25 Edward 3rd, or the remoter treasons of
Foster and Hale. His whole discourse hangs
by one slender thread. He perpetually refers
to the new and portentous treason of his own
mere creation, “a conspiracy to subvert the
“ monarchy ;” a treason, which he ingenu-
ously avows “ no lawgiver in this country has
ever ventured to contemplate,” and “the.
statute of Edward 3rd, by which we are bound,
has not declared.” Upon this self-constituted
treason he hangs his other conjectures and
novelties as well as he is able, by the help of
forced constructions, of ambiguous and de-
ceitful words, and all the delusions of a prac~
tised sophister. Was it necessary for the de-
struction of twelve private and untitled men,
to create all this confusion, to luce all this
ruin, to overturn every thing that is valuable
in English liberty, and place us for time com-
ing under the most atrocious and inexplicable
despotism that the world ever saw?

Let usattend to the opinion of judge Black-
stone upon this subject.

White, solicitor for the treasury, delivered to
each of the prisonersa copy of the indictment,
a list of the jurors impanelled by the sheriff,
and a list of the witnesses to be produced by
the crown for proving the said indictment.

« By the ancient common law, there was a
great latitude left in the breast of the judges,
to determine what was treason or not so;
whereby the creatures of tyrannical princes
had opportunity to create abundance of con-
structive treasons : that is, to raise, by forced
andarbitrary constructions, offences into the
crime and punishment of treason, which never
were suspected to besuch. To prevent these
inconveniences, the statute 25 Edward Srd,
chap. 2, was made. [Book iv. chap. 6, p. Te |
This is a great security to the public, a
leaves a weighty memento to judges to be care-
ful, and not overhasty in letting in treasons
by construction or interpretation, especially
in new cascs that have not been resolved and
settled—The legislature was extremely libe-
ral in declaring new treasons in the unfortu-
nate reign of king Richard the second; but,
in the first year of his successor’s reign, an
act “‘ was passed, which at once swept away
this whole load of extravagant treasons. Af-
terwards, particularly in the bloody reign of
Henry 8th, the spirit of inventing new and
strange treasons was revived ; all which new-
fangled crimes were totally abrogated by the
statute 1 Mary, chap. 1; since which time the
legislature has become more cautious upon
this subject.” [P. 85, 86.]

- The first mode in which, according to chief
justice Eyre, an association for parliamentary
reform, may incur the penalties of high trea-
son, is when “ other purposes, besides those
of parliamentary reform, and of the most trai-
torous nature, are hidden under this veil.”
The purposes he may be supposed to mean,
are those of his new-fangled treason, of “ con-
spiring to subvert the monarchy.” Thus,
in the first place, we have an innocent purpose
constituting the professed object of this sup-

josed association ; and behind that the grand
Tay are to discover, if they can, a secret. pur-
pose, totally unlike that which the associators
profess; and this purpose chief justice Eyre

leclares to be treason, contrary, as he avow-
edly confesses, to all law, precedent, and ad-
judicated cases.

The second mode, in which the chief justice
is willing to pre-suppose high treason in an
association for parliamentary reform is, by
such an association, not in its own nature, as
he says, “ simply unlawful, too easily degene-
rating, and becoming unlawful in the highest
degree.”

t is difficult to comment upon this article
with the gravity, that may seem due to a ma-
gistrate, delivering his opinions from a bench
of justice. “ An association for parliamentary
reform ey degenerate, and become unlawful
in the highest degree, even to the enormous
extent of the crime of high treason.” Who

knows not that? Was it necessary that
chief justice Eyre should come in 1794, so-
lemnly to announce to us so irresistible a_
proposition? An association for parliamen-
tary reform may desert its object, and be
guilty of high treason. True: so may a card
club, a bench of justices, or even a cabinet
council. Does chief justice Eyre mean to in-
sinuate, that there is something in the pur-
pose of a parliamentary reform, so unhallow-
ed, ambiguous, and unjust, as to render ts
well-wishers ohjects of suspicion, rather than
their brethren and fellow subjects? What
can be more wanton, cruel, and inhuman,
than thus gratuitously to single out the pur-
pose of parliamentary reform, asif it were, of
all others, most especially connected with de-
generacy and treason?

But what is principally worthy of observa-
tion in both these cases, is, the easy and artful
manner in which the idea of treason is in-
troduced into them. First, there is a ‘ con-
cealed purpose,” or an insensible “ degene-
racy,” supposed to take place in these asso-
ciations. Next, that “concealed purpose,”
or insensible “ degeneracy,” is suppo:ed to
tend directly to this end, the “ subversion of
the monarchy.” Lastly, a “ conspiracy to
subvert the monarchy,” is a treason, first
discovered by chief justice Eyrein 1794, never
contemplated by any lawgiver, or included in
any statute. Deny the chief justice any one
of his three assumptions, and his whole de-
duction falls to the ground. Challenge him,
or any man living, to prove any of them ; an
you require of him an impossibility. And it
1s by this sort of logic, which would be scout-
ed in the rawest graduate in either of our uni-
versities, that Englishmen are to be brought
under the penalties of treason!

Of these assumptions, the most flagrant
perhaps, if in reality there can be any grada~
tion in such groundless assertions, is that
which imputes to the associations a “ con-
spiracy to subvert the “monarchy.” The
chief justice knows, for no man is !gnorant,
that there is not the shadow of evidence of
such a conspiracy. If any man in England
wishes the subversion of the monarchy, is
there a man in England that does not feel, that
such subversion, ifcftected at all, can only beef-
fected by an insensible revolution of opinion?
Did these associations plan the murder of the
king, and the assassination of the royal fami-
ly?” Where are the proofs of it? But the

mination, to whom these appellations shall
once have been attributed !
If chief justice Eyre, or his majesty’s ser-
vants, have any charge of high treason to ad-
-vance, let them advance,it. The purpose of
parliamentary reform, as the chiefjustice con-
tesses, so far from being treasonable, is not
“ simply unlawful.” If the persons now in
confinement, have been guilty of high treason,
that is the point to hich our attention is to
be called. Their treason is-neither greater
nor less, for their being engaged in a lawful
object, the associating for a parliamentary re-
form. Tell us what they have done that is
criminal, and do not seek to excite extrajudi-
cial prejudices against them for what is inno-
cent.
Having dismissed the immediate purpose of
a parliamentary reform, the chief justice goes
on in the last place to consider “the project
of aconvention, to be assembled under the ad-
vice and direction of some of these associa-
tions.”
and here it was impossible not to recollect,
that conventions and meetings of delegates
are by no means foreign to the English his-
tory; and that twelve or fourteen years ago,
many of his majesty’s present ministers were
deeply engaged in a project of this nature.
Accordin; f » the chief justice takes a very me-
morable distinction. He calls it “a project,
which in better times would have been hardly
thought worthy of grave consideration, but, in
these, our days, when it has been attempted
to be pat in execution in a distant part of the
united kingdom, and with the example of a
neighbouring country before our eyes, is de-
scevedly become an object of jealousy to the
w,”?
This remark constitutes one of the most
flagrant violations of the principles of executive
justice, that was ever heard of or imagined.
If the times require different measures of jus-
tice, we are already instructed by the act 25
Edward Srd, as to the proceeding fitting to
be employed. “ The judge,” says the act,
“ shall tarry, without going to judgment of
the treason, till the cause be shown and de-
clared before the Eine and his parliament,
whether it ought to be judged treason or
other felony.” Parliament, the legislative
authority of the realm, may make new provi-
sions of law in accommodation to circum-
stances; but the judges, the bare expounders
- of the law, are bound to maintain themselves
4n an atmosphere unaffected by the variations
of popular clamour, ministerial vengeance, or
the ever-changing nature of circumstances.

they are to find to day. An interpretation,
shifting with every gale of accident, may pro-
duce undefinable terrors in its miserable vic-
tims, may devote its authors to eternal exe-
cration, but can have none of the venerable
features either of law or justice.

Some of the dreadful consequences in-
volved in this loose and fluctuating interpre-
tation, show themsclves in the very next sen-
tence.

“ Tt will be your duty,” says the chief jus-
tice to the jury, “ to examine the evidence
on this head very caretully, and to sift
it to the bottom: to consider every part of
it in itself, and as it stands connected with
other parts of it; and to draw the conclusion
of fact, as to the existence, the nature and ob-
ject of this proposed convention, from the
whole.

“In the course of the evidence you will
probably hear of bodies of men having been
collected together, of violent resolutions voted
at this and other meetings, of some prepara
tion of offensive weapons, and of the adoption
of the language and manners of those con-
ventions in France, which have possessed
themselves of the government of that country.
I dwell not on thers particulars, because I
consider them not as substantive treasons,
but as circumstances of evidence, tending to
ascertain the true nature of the object which
these persons had in view.”

Here we have set before us, in the most
unblushing and undisguised manner, that
principle of constructive treason, which has
upon all occasions formed an object of exe-
cration in English history. Let us hear what
Hume says upon the subject in the farther
progress of that very passage which has been
already quoted.

“As is species of treason, discovered by
the Commons, ‘ in the casc of lord Strafforde,’
is entirely new and unknown to the laws; so
is the species of proof by which they pretend
to fix that guilt upon the prisoner. They
have invented a kind of accumulative or con-
structive evidence, by which many actions,
either totally innocent in themselves, or cri-
minal in a much inferior degree, shall, when
united amount to treason, and subject the
person to the highest penalties inflicted by
the law. A hasty and unguarded word, a
rash and passionate action, assisted by the
malevolent fancy of the accuser, and tortured
by doubtful constructions, is transmuted into
the deepest guilt, and the lives and fortunes
of the whole nation, no longer pratected by
justice, are subjected to arbitrary will and

here delivered by chief justice Eyre, and the
‘condemnation pronounced upon them by
way of anticipation by the illustrious Hume.
Thus, “ a hasty and unguarded word,”—
« Adoption of the language of the convention
in France,”—“ A rash and passionate action,”
—* Violent resolutions voted at this and other
‘meetings — some preparation of offensive
weapons,”—* Actions either totally innocent
in themselves, or criminal in a much inferior
degree”—“ I consider not these particulars
as substantive treasons.”

Can any thing be more atrocious, than the
undertaking to measure the guilt of an indi-
vidual, and the interpretation of a plain and
permanent law, by the transitory example
that may happen to exist “ before our eyes in
a neighbouring country ?”

The chief justice speaks of two sorts of
convention. The first, “ a convention, in
imitation of those which we have heard of in
France, in order to usurp the government of
the country.”

There lurks a memorable ambiguity under
this word convention. A convention ~ was
held no long time ago, of delegates from the
royal burghs in Scotland, to consider of a
reformation in the administration of those
burghs, Of this convention, the present lord
advocate of Scotland, among others, was a
member. A convention was proposed in
1780, of delegates from'the different county
meetings held at that period. Both these
conventions were considerably more formi-
dable in their structure than that which is the
subject of present animadversion. The royal
burghs, and the meetings of freeholders in
the several countics, consist of bodies more
or less recognized by the constitution, and
possessing a degree of inherent authority.
The convention Proposed in the present in-
stance, was simply of delegates from the dif-
ferent societies, voluntarily associated for the
purpose of parliamentary reform. They could
possess no inherent authority. The per-
sons who constituted them, must have been

‘actuated by the most perfect insanity, before

they could have dreamed of usurping the
government of the country. No delusion,
therefore, can be more gross, than an attempt
to style, as chief justice Eyre styles, such a
convention “ a convention of the people.”

In describing his first sort of convention,
the chief juni roundly affirms, “ that the
project of such a convention, and any one
step taken towards bringing it about, such
as, for instance, consultations, forming com-
mittees to consider of the means, or acting in
those committees, would be a case of no dif-
ficulty : it would be the clearest high treason ;
it would be compassing and imagining the
King’s death ; and not only his death, but the

death and destruction of all order, religion,
and laws, of all property, and security for the
lives and liberties of the king’s subjects.”

There is a figure in speech, of the highest use
to a designing and treacherous orator, which
has not yet perhaps received a name in the la-
bours of Aristotle, Quintillian, or Farnaby,
I would call this figure encroachment. It is
a proceeding, by which an affirmation is mo-
destly insinuated at first, accompanied with
considerable doubt and qualification ; repeated
afterwards, unaccompanied with these quali-
fications; and at. last asserted in the most
perenne and arrogant terms. It is thus
that chief justice Eyre expresses himself re-
specting a “ conspiracy to overturn the mo-
narchy.” It is first a treason, “ not declared
by the statute 25 Edward 3rd;” a treasoa
“which no lawgtver in this country has ever
ventured to contemplate ;” a treason, “ not
resting for its authority upon any law, pre-
cedent, or adjudged case.” It 1s not this
thing, nor it is not that; “ the seditio regai
spoken of by some of our ancient writers, but
which is no part of our law, seems to come the
nearest to it,” but will not apply. ‘* the par-
ticular nature of the traitorous attempt, will
fall within one or other of the specific trea-
sons of the statute of Edward 3rd.” A strange
crime, which the judge knows is provided
against by the first or the second principal
clause, but is unable to determine whether it
is by the former or the latter! Afterwards
the chief justice speaks of it with less hesi-
tation ; and at last, as we have seen, affirms
it to be “a case of no difficulty,and the clearest
high treason.”

Can any play upon words be more con-
temptible, than that by which the chief jus-
tice, finding the king’s death the subject of
one of the clauses, and determined to trace
at least some remote analogy between that
and the subversion of the monarchy, describes
the latter by the appellation of “ the death
and destruction of all order, religion, Sc. &c. t”

The second sort of convention in chief jus-
tice Eyre’s arrangement, isaconvention, which,
not intending to usurp the government of the
country, “ has for its sole object the effecting
a change in the mode of representation o'
the people in parliament, and the obtaining
that parliaments should be held annually.
And here,” says the chief justice, “ there ts
room to distinguish. Such a project of con-
vention, taking it to be criminal,”

“Taking it to be criminal!” Was ever
postulate, more extraordinary, or more intol-
erable? Did ever judge, sitting upon the
bench, previously to this instance, assume the
whole question ; affirm at his ease, and with-
out the shadow of an authority, scriptural or
nuncupatory, statute or report, the whole cx-

Terminer of our sovereign lord the king of and
for the county of Middlesex holden at the
Session House on Clerkenwell-green in the
said county on Thursday the second day of
October in the thirty-fourth year of the reign
of our sovereign lord George the Third by the |

minality; and then proceed at his leisure to
distribute the assumed criminality into all its |
different degrees? Meanwhile, after this loud
and peremptory preamble, the chief justice is |
obliged to grant, that one sort of convention, |
one “ degree of criminality,” “ a convention, |
having for its sole object a dutiful and peace-
able application to parliament by petition,
cannot of itself be ranked among this class of
offences.” He dares not affirm that it is to |
be ranked among any class of offences what-
ever.—But to proceed to the distinctions he
undertakes to enunrerate.

The first sort of “ Convention, which has |
for its object the obtaining a parliamentary
teform, and that object only, is a convention,
pepong to obtain it without the authority of
parliament,” and for that purpose “ usurping,
at least in this instance, the functions of legis-
lation.” This the chief justice determines,
upon just the same grounds as in the preced-
ing instances, “ would be high treason in
every one of the actors.”

After this laborious discussion, chief justice
Eyre is not yet satisfied that he has framed a
construction, strong enough to ensnare the
os now under confinement. He has

ped distinction upon distinction. He has
promulgated at least five or six different
elasees of treason, not found in the direct
ovisions of 25 Edward 3rd, or in the remoter
stances of Foster and Hale; not supported,
as he explicitly confesses, by any law, prece-
dent, or adjudged case. But all this he does
im the mere wantonness of his power. If any
ef the prisoners now under confinement had
acted according to all the as iereonns of his
irmeginary cases, it may safely be affirmed,
that, upon any sober trial pti a charge of
high treason, they must infallibly be acquitted.
But the chief justice implicitly confesses, that
they have not acted according to any one of
his cases. All this profusion of fiction, hypo-
thesis, and prejudication, is brought forward
for the sole purpose, either of convincin:
of the unparalleled ingenuity of the lord chief
justice of his majesty’s court of Common
Pleas, or to bewilder the imaginations, to
throw dust in the eyes, and confound the un-
derstandings of the grand jury and the nation.
If this last be the purpose conceived, and if
it could possibly be supposed that it should be
successful for a moment, early would be the

ce, deep the remorse, and severe, it

is to be feared, the retribution !
The chief justice then, having hitherto
talked of every thing that is not to the pur-
comes at last to speak of the matter in
Kind. Here he employs ali his ingenuity,
exerts ail his arts, ail displays his utmost in-

trepidity of countenance. This part of the
case is opened as follows :

“ Whether the projectofaconvention, having
for its object the cdllzeting togethera power
which should overawe the legislative body,
but not suspen it, or entirely determine its
functions, if acted upon, will also amount to
high treason, and to the specifi: treason of
compassing and imagining the king’s death,
is a more doubtful question. Thus far is
clear‘ a force upon the parliament, must be
immediately directed against the king. It
must reach the king, or it can have no effect
at all. The laws are enacted in parliament
by the ksing’s majesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Lords and Commons in
parliament assembled. A force meditated
against the parliament, therefore, is a force
meditated against the king, and seems to fall
within the cases described.”

Nothing can be more gross fo the view of
any one who will attentively read this para-

aph, than its total want ofall definite and
intelligible meaning. The chief justice talks
of “ collecting together a power,” and of “a
force” exercised upon the parliament. What
is here intended by the words power and
force? Under the kindly ambiguity of these,
words, the chief ghee seen very willing to
slip upon us the idea of an armed power and
amilitary force. But thiscan scarcely by any
construction be reconciled to the idea ofa
convention. An army of delegates was an
idea reserved for chief justice Eyre to intros
duce into the worl ell then: let us
pose that arms and violence are not intended;
yet the chief justice says, that the project of a
convention has for its object ‘ the collecting
together a power, which should overawe the
legislative body.” This word is still more
ambiguous than any of the rest. What are
we to understand by the phrase “ to over-
awe?” Awe in its true acceptation has always.
been understood to mean deference or re-
spect. It cannot mean any thing else here,
since, as we have already seen, armed power
and military force are out of the question,
But in this sense what is the object of every
species of convention or political association
whatever? It is always intended to produce
deference and respect. Thus the chief justice
very properly observes, that “ a convention,
having for its sole object a dutiful and peace-
able application to parliament,” does not fail
to find that application attended with “ re-
spect and credit, in proportion to its univer.
sality.” Indeed there can be no doubt, that
there are but two ways of operating upon
men’s conduct, the one, hy exhibiting argu-
ments calculated to prevail upon their own

inclinations and conviction, the uther a per-
ceiving huw much the thing required accords
with the sense of numerous bodies of men,
and budics uf men entitled to eminent credit.
* Such being the substance of the most ma-
terial paragraph in the charge to the grand
jury, let us see in what manner this paragraph

is concluded, and what are the inferences |

drawn trom it. Whatis the treatment due
to this force which is no force; thiscollecting
together a power, unarmed, and entitled to
credit only fur its universality? What shall
be done to the men who thus overawe the
legislative body, by exciting its deference and
; or, failing this, do not overawe it at
all, inasmuch as they have no power to in-
force their demands? “ Whether or no,” as
chict justice Eyre sagaciously ubseives, the
project of such a convention will amount to
high treason, is a more doubtful question.”
He adds, “ in this case it docs not appear to
me, that | am warranted by the authorities, tu
state to you as clear law, that the mere con-
spiracy to raise such a force” (recollect what
has been said upon the nature of this force],
“ and the entering into consultations respect-
ing it, will alone, and without actually raising
the force, constitute the crime of high treason.

What the law is in that case, and what will

be the effect of the circumstance of the force
being thus meditated, will be fit to be so-
Jemnly considered and determined when the
case shall arise.”

Here the chief justice speaks with a proper
degree of modesty and precaution, so far as
relates to the supposed guilt of the persons
under confinement; but when he has occasion

to resume the subject, he, in his usual manner

introduces a variation into the statement.

“Tt may perhaps be fitting,” says he, “ if

you find these persons involved in such a de-
sign, and if the charges of high treason are
oficred to be maintained against them upon
that ground, that, in respect of the extraordi-
Nary nature, the dangerous extent, and at
the best, the very criminal complesion of such
a-conspiracy, this case, which I state to you
as a new and a duubtful case, should be put
into a judicial course of inquiry, that it may
receive a culemn adjudication, whether it will
or will not amount to high treason.”

"It is diflicult to conceive of any thing more
abhorrent to the genuine principles of buma-
nity, tian the ductrine here delivered. The
chief justice, after having enumerated various
sorts of treason, respecting which he speaks
diflidently at first, and pcremptorily at last,
but which are all the mere creatures of his
own imagination, comes toa case upon which

aver the procecding described in it to be trea-
son, Well, then; what is the remedy he pro-

poses? Surely anew act of parliament; the
remedy prescribed by the act of Edward 3rd,
* “in cases of treason, which may happen in
| time to come, but which could net then be
thought of or declared.” No such thing.
| Upon this case, which he does not venture to
pronounce to be treason, he directs the grand
jury to findthe bills to be true bills! He
tells them, “ that it is fitting that this case,”
which he “ statcs as new and doubttul, shouid
be put into a judicial course of inquiry, that
it may receive a solemn adjudication, whether
it will or will not amount to high treason !”
| ‘The chief justice, in this instance, quits
the character of acriminal judge and a civil
magistrate, and assumes that of a natural
philosopher or experimental anatomist. He
is willing to dissect the persons that shall be
brought before him, the better to ascertain
the truth or falsehood of his preconceived
conjectures, The plain English of his recom-
mendation is this: “ Let these men be put
upon trial fer their lives; let them and their
friends, through the remotest strainers of
connexion, be exposed to all the anxieties
incident to so uncertain and fearful a condi-
i tion; let them be exposed to ignominy, to
obloquy, to the partialities, as it may happen,
of'a prejudiced judge, and the perverseness of
au ignorant jury: we shall then know how
we ought to conceive of similar cases. By
trampling upon their peace, throwing away
their lives, or sporting wih their innocence,
we shall obtain a basis upon which to proceed,
and a precedent to guide our judgment in
future instances,”

This is a sort of language which it is im-
i possible to recollect without horror, and
which seems worthy of the judicial ministers
of liberius or Nero. It argues, if the speaker
understocd his own meaning, or if the paper
before me has faithfully reported it, the most
frigid indifference to human happiness and
human life. According to this method of
estimate. laws, precedents, cases, and reports
j} are of high value, and the hanging a few
individuals is a very cheap, economical and
proper way of purchasing the decision of a
doubtful speculation.

Surely it would be worthy, if not of the
; judges, at least of the immediate ministers of
the sovereign, to consider whether, if they
mean to put us under a new rule of criminal
Jaw, it be not better solemnly to originate
that lawin the two Houses of Parliament,

structions of old statutes, contrary to all law
and precedent, and contrary to the security
aul liberty of the subject.

In Jreland, some time ago, it was thought
pope to bring forward a convention-bill,
declaring such proceedings, as are the subjects
of the forced constructions of chief baron
Eyre, to amount to high treason. When the
Habeas Corpus act was suspended in England,
wewere given to understand that this pro-

ceeding was thought sufficient for the present, '

and that a convention-bill, similar to the
Trish, and other severe measures, were re-
served to be adopted, as the case might
require. This fallacious show of lenity, now
turns out to be the most unprincipled tyranny.
Mr. Dundas and others talked in the last
session of parliament, of bringing home the
Scottish principles of jurisprudence, if need
were, to England, and rendering associations
and conventions a subject of transportation to
Botany Bay. They have since refined upon
their plan, and carried the law of England,
or what they are pleased to call so, into
Scotland, rendering these offences, real or
imaginary, a subject of the penalties of high
treason. Such have been the incroachinents
upon the constitution, by men who have the
audacity to cali themselves its champions,
that a man who should have pretended to
foretel, from six months to six months, the
measures they would think proper to pursue,
would have been laughed at for the improba-
bility and utter absurdity of his tale. Britons
willat length awake, and the effects of reason
and conviction upun them, will not be less
formidable or Jess unacceptable to their op-
pressors, than the effects that might flow
trom a course of violence !

I have hitherto abstained from saying anv
thing respecting the personal characters of
the men now under accusation. If their
aoilities be as rare, and their merits as high as
Lieir warmest admirers can conceive them, it
would still be foreign to the question I propose
to consider. If they be men, exceptionable
in their character, ambiguous in their designs,
and mischievous in their counsels, that also

ought to be put out of the consideration. The |

English constitution is strong enough to dis-
arm all the adversarics of the public peace,
without its being necessary for that purpose
to destroy its very essence. Twelve men are
apparently concerned, but the liberties and
happiness of all are at stake. If these new
treasons be established, we may say, as the
parliament of Henry the fourth did, speaking
of the new-fangled treasons under Richard
the second, that “ no man can know how he

for doubt of the pains of treason” [Black-
stone, book iv, chap. 6, p. 86]. The construc
tions of chiet justice Kyre, and the special
commission, put a perpetual bar to all asso-’
ciations, delegations, and consultings respect-
ing any species of grievance. Will any man
venture to say, that we shall never stand in
need of these expedients ; or shall we consent
for all time coming, to hold every possible
retorm and amendment at the mere will of,
the administration? If these principles be
established, utterly subversive as they are of
the principles of the English government,’
who will say that we shall stop here? Chief
justice Eyre says today, “ all men may, nay,’
all men must, if they possess the faculty of
thinking, reason upon every thing, that’
sufficiently interests them to become an’
object of their attention; and among the’
‘ objects of attention of freemen, the principles’
of government, the constitution of particular’
governments, and, above all, the constitution”
of the government under which they live,‘
will naturally engage attention and provoke‘
speculation.” But who will say how long
this liberty will be tolerated, if the principles, °
so alarmingly opened in the charge to thes
grand jury, shall once be established? This’

speculations of France, but we shall certainly:
have reason to envy the milder tyrannies of
‘Turkey and Ispahan. i
Krom what has been said it appears, that
the whole proceedings intended in the present
case, are of the nature of an er post facto law.
‘This is completely admitted by the chief

condemnation. If therefore he address them
in the frank language of sincerity, he must
say: “Six months ago you engaged in meay
sures, which you believed conducive to the
public good. You examined them in the
sincerity of your hearts, and you admitted
them with the full conviction of the under-
standing. You adopted them from this ruling
motive, the love of your country and man-
kind. You had no warning that the measures
in which you engaged were acts of high
treason: no law told you so; no precedent
recorded it; no man existing upon the face of

well-intentioned, though mistaken men. ; the earth could have predicted such an inter-
Punishment is awarded in human courts of pretation. You went to your beds with a
justice, either according to the intention, or | perfect and full conviction, that you had arted
the mischief committed. If the intention be . upon the principles of immutable justice, and
alone to be considered, then the men of , that you had offended no provision or statute

whom I speak, however unguarded and preju-
dicial their conduct'may be supposed to have
been, must on that ground be infallibly ac-
quitted. If, on the other hand, the mischief
incurred be the sole measure of the punish-
ment, we are bound by every thing that is
sacred to proceed with reluctance and regret.
Let it be supposed, that there are cases,
where it shall be necessary, that a well
designing man should be cut off, for the sake
of the whole. The least consideration that
we can pay in so deplorable a necessity, is, to
warn him of his danger, and not suffer him to
incur the penalty, without any previous cau-
tion, without so much as the knowledge of
ats existence.

I anticipate the trials to which this charge
is the prelude. I know that the judge will
admit the good intention and honest design of

that was ever devised. I, the judge sitting
upon the bench, you, gentlemen of the jury,
every inhabitant of the island of Great Britain,
_ had just as much reason to conceive they were
incurring the penalties of the law, as the pri-
soners at the bar. This is the nature of the
crime; these are the circumstances of the
case, “

“ And for this, the sentence of the court
; [but not of the law] is, That you, and each of
yon, shall be taken from the bar, and con-
veyed to the place from whence you came,
and from thence be drawn ‘upon 8 hurdle to
the place of execution, there to be hanged by
the neck, but not until you are dead; you
shall be taken down alive, your privy mem-
bers shall be cut off, and your bowels shall be
taken out and burnt before your faces; your
heads shall be severed from your bodies, and

several of the persons arraigned: it will be | your bodies shall then be divided into four
impossible to deny it; it is notorious to the | quarters, which are to be at the king’s dis-
whole universe. He has already admitted, | posal; and the Lord have mercy on your
that there is no law or precedent for their | souls!”

THE JURY.
Thomas Buck, Thomas Sayer,
Thomas Wood, Richard Carter,
William Fraser, Nathaniel Stonard,
Adam Steinmetz, Joseph Nichol, @

Newell Connop, John Charrington,
John Mercer, Joseph Ainslie.
Me. Thomas Shelton (clerk of the arraigns).
Thomas Hardy, hold up your hand.
Gentlemen of the Jury, the prisoner, Tho-
mas Hardy, stands indicted, together with
John Horne Tooke, &c—{Here the. Clerk of

Arraigns read the Indictment].—Upon this
indictment he hath been arraigned, and upon
his arraignment hath pleaded not guilty, and
for his trial hath put himself upon God and
the country, which country you are. Your
charge is, to inquire whether he be guilty of
the high treason whereof he stands indicted,
or not guilty. If you find him guilty, you
are to inquire what goods or chattels, lands
or tenements, he had at the time of the
high treason committed, or at any time since.
If you find him not guilty, you are to inquire
whether he fled for it, if you find that he
did fly tor it, you shall inquire of his goods
aud chattels as if you had found him guilty.
If you find him not guilty, and that he did not
fly for it, say so, and no more, and hcar your
evidence.

The Indictment was opened by Mr. Wood.

Mr. Attorney-General (sir John Scott).—
May it please your Lordship and Gentlemen of
the Jury ;—In the course of stating what I
have to offer to your must serious attention
in this great and weighty cause, affecting, as
it certainly does, the dearest interests of the
community, affecting, as you will remember
throughout this business, every interest which
can be valuable to the prisoner at the bar, I
shall have frequent occasion to call that anxi-
ous attention to the different parts of the in-
dictment which has just been opened to you.
1 forbear to do so at this moment, because I
think that attention will be more usefully,
both with respect to the public, and to the
prisoner, given and required in another part
of what Iam to address to you.

Gentlemen, the prisoner, who is before you,
stands charged (to state the indictment gene-
rally) with the offence of compassing his ma-
jesty’s death; he was committed upon that
charge by his majesty’s privy council: I will
explain to you presently why I state this and
the following facts. In consequence of the
apprehension of this prisoner, of several
others charged by this indictment, and of
others whose names do not occur in this in-
dictment, proceedings of some notoricty were
had in parliament, and an act passed, em-
powering his majesty to detain such persons
as he suspected were conspiring against his
government. That act has asserted, that a
traitorous and detestable conspiracy had been
formed for subverting the existing laws and
government of the country, and for introduc-
ing that system of anarchy and confusion,
which had so fatally prevailed in France ; the
act, upon the spur oft the emergency, which it
contemplated, authorized the detention with-
out bail, mainprize, or discharge, of the per-
sons then in prison for high treason, or trea-
sonable practices, or who should afterwards
be committed, for high treason or treasonable
practices, by warrants from the privy council
or secretary of state, until the first of Febru-
ary, 1795.

Gentlemen, this ‘measure, which did not
suspend the operation of the Habeas Corpus



act, that great palladium of English liberty,
but with reference to particular persons, un-
der particular commitments, for particular
offences, is a measure never adopted in this
country by parliament but in cases, in which it
is understood, after giving all possible atten -
tion to secure the right of the subject from
being broken in upon, to be of the last possi-
ble necessity, and which has been repeatedly
putin foree, in the best of times, in such
cases, where the wisdom of parliament appre-
hended that it was matter of their duty to
rovide that the nation should part with its
iberty for a while, that it might not lose it
for er = aa
entlemen, appearing before you this da:
in discharge of Sardi, which I have beet
commanded to execute and the execution of
which appears to me to be absolutely ne-
cessary, you will collect from the fact that
I do appear here this day, that, accordin,
to the true constitutional meaning of suc
an act of parliament, it is not that the trial
of such persons shall be delayed during the
period of the suspension of the act, but
that the act shall, with reference to the time
of trial, be allowed, in the right execution
of it, an operation only to that extent in
which the due consideration of the public
safety, tempered with a due attention to the
liberty of the individual subject, may require.

Gentlemen, the proceedings of the legisla-
lature having been such as T have stated to
you, his majesty, constitutionally advised in
the exercise of his duty, as the great conser-
vator of the public peace, directed a commis-
sion to issue to inquire whether any such trea-
sons, as the presumption of such a traitorous
conspiracy must necessarily suppose to have
existed, had been committed by any persons,
and by whom. In the execution of the duties
of that commission, a grand jury of this coun-
ty, upon their oaths, have declared that there
is ground of charge against the person at the
bar, and against others, sufficient to call upon
them, ina trial to be had before you, their
country, to answer tov an accusation of high
treason, in compassing his majesty’s death.

Gentlemen, I have stated these circum-
stances, that I may convey to you, in as
strong terms as I can express it, this observa-
tion, that, as the proccedings of parliament
ought to have had (and I am persuaded, from
the deliberation which they gave the subject,
that they had) no influence upon the judicial
mind of the grand inquest, ncither ought these
proceedings to affect your inquiries, or to in-
duce you to any determination, which you are
to make upon the issue, which you are now
sworn to try.

Gentlemen, there is no one circumstance of
any proceedings before parliament, with re-
ference to which you ought to suffer your-
selves to be influenced in the trial of this is-
sue. It is obvious that such proceedings, as
were had in parliament, providing for great
emergencies, may be required and autho-

rized by the genuine spirit of the constitu-
tion, even in cases in which a grand jury might
not, upon any thing that could be offered to
their consideration, be justified in finding a
bill: it is much more obvious, that, in a pro-
ceeding before you, a consideration of the wis-
dom and propriety of the acts of the legisla-
ture is not called for.

You therefore, gentlemen of the jury, will
consider the prisoner as standing before you
in full possession of an absolute right to the
presumption of innocence, notwithstanding

e is charged with guilt by this indictment,
as you will hear,except so far as that presump-
tion is met by the single simple fact, that he has
been accused by a grand jury of his country.

Gentlemen, before I conclude these generat
observations, you will permit me to say, on
the other hand, that, if there has been any
thing that has fallen under your observation,
by act or publication—any attempt to make

‘ any impression upon the minds of those who
are this day impanelied to try this great cause,
to disparage that advice, which, under the
most responsible sanction, may be given you
in matter of law, to work in your minds any
prejudice either against the prisoner, or on
the prisoner’s behalf; on the one hand I am
perfectly sure that your integrity will be secu-
rity to the public, that you will not permit
any attempt of that kind to have any opera-
tion; on the other hand, gentlemen of the jury,
Tam equally sure that I necd not ask from an
English jury, that ane would permit no such
attempt to prejudice them against the prison-
er at the bar,—no, not even an injudicious or
ill executed attempt, to influence them in his
favour.

Gentlemen, in order to understand the law
of treason, and the indictment, I shall take
the liberty first to state to you the character
which I apprehend the king, for the protec-
tion of whose person and government the
statute in question was made, has in the
State and constitution of this country.

Gentlemen, the power of the state, by
‘which I mean the power of making laws, and
enforcing the execution of them when made,
is vested in the king; enacting laws, in the
one case, that is, in his legislative character, by
and with the advice and consent of the Lords
spiritual and temporal, and of the Commons
in parliament assembled, assembled according
to the law and constitutional custom of Eng-
land; in the other case, executing the laws,
when made, in subservience to the laws so
made, and with the advice, which the law and
the constitution have assigned to him in al-
most every instance, in which they have called
upon him to act for the benefit of the subject.
The king’s authority, under the check of con-
stitutional and legal provisionsand limitations,
convenes and regulates the duration and ex-
istence of parliament, convening those whom,
according to the law and custom of the coun-
try, he is bound to convene. The king, in
his parliament, sitting in his royal political


capacity, and the Lords and Commons there
assembled, form the great body politic of the
kingdom, by which is exercised sovereign au-
thority in legislation. Gentlemen, whilst the
present law, the present constitution, and pre-
sent government of Great Britain, exist, no
law can be made but by that authority ; no
legislative power can be created against the
will, andin defiance of that authority. Whe-
ther in any, or in what circumstances, an at-
tempt to create such a power isa treason for-
biden by the statute of the 25th of Edward
Srd, I propose to examine presently.

Gentlemen, as in the king the power of
legislation is vested, as well as the executive
power of the state, to be exercised with con-
sent and advice, to be exercised according to
those laws, which are the birthright and in-
heritance of the subject, having upon him
the care and protection of the community ;
to him, in return, the allegiance of every in-
dividual is, according to the law of England,
due ; that allegiance, by which the subject is
bound, in the Janguage of the statutes of this
country, to defend him “ against all traitorous
conspiracies and attempts whatsoever, which
shall be made against his person, his crown,
or his dignity.”

Gentlemen, to ascertain to whom this care
and protection is committed—to ascertain to
whom this allegiance is due, the breach of
which, according to the venerable lord Hale,
constitutes high treason, is necessary to the
peace of the community—to ascertain and to
define accurately what constitutes a breach
of that allegiance, is essentially and absolutely
necessary to the security of all that our an-
cestors have claimed, demanded, and insisted
upon, as the ancient, undoubted rights and
liberties of our country.

Gentlemen, the former of these ubjects is
secured by the law and constitutional custom
of England; that law which alike secures to
you every right, whether it be a right of per-
son or of property. It has made the crown,
which his majesty wears, hereditary (and I
beg your attention to that), subject to limi
tation by parliament. The latter object has
been most anxiously secured by the statute
referred to in the indictment, which brings
forward the charge, the truth of which you
are now to try.

Gentlemen, the king having this hereditary
crown, the law and constitution have also as-
certained his dutics—those duties, which it is
incumbent upon him to execute, for the bene-
fit of the subject, in the execution of which
duties they have aided him with counsel, and
in consideration of which duties they have
clothed him with dignity, and vested him
with high prerogatives. With respect to the
duties of the king, they attach upon him the
instant he becomes such; from the moment
that his title accrues, in the same instant the
duty of allegiance (the breach of which is
high treason) attaches to it; he recognizes
these as his duties in that oath, to which,

throughout this business, I must again call
your attention, in that cath which he is bound
to take upon him, at bis coronation, by which
he promises and swears “ to govern the peo-
ple of this country,” mark the words, gentle-
men, “ according to the statutes in parliament
agreed upon, and the laws and customs of the
sume ; that to his power he will cause law in
justice and mercy to be administered; that
he will maintain the laws of God and the
true profession of religion established by law.”

Gentlemen, this oath, stated by that great
and venerable constitutional judge, Mr.
Justice Foster, to be a solemn and a public
recognition, not only of the duties of the
king, but of the fundamental rights of the
people, imposeth upon him (and throughout |
this case it cannot be too strongly recollected
that it imposeth upon him) the most sacred
obligation to govern according to the laws
and statutes in parliament agreed upon, ac-
cording to the laws and customs of the same,
and no other.

Gentlemen, addressing this Court, which
is a court of law, in which you, the jury, are
sworn to make a true deliverance according
to the law of England, can I impress it too
strongly that it cannot be supposed by possi-
bility—not by possibility—that the king can,
consistently with his oath, and with the an-
tecedent duty recognized in the explicit en-
gagement, the terms of which you have heard,
either act, or permit himself to act, as kin,
according to any rules of government, forme:
by any bodies of men, assuming any charac-
ter, functions, or situations, those rules of
government being meant to operate as laws,
the statutes agreed upon in parliament, and the
duws and customs of the same, only excepted ?

Gentlemen, it seems to me to follow, as a
necessary conclusion from the reasoning to
be addressed to a court of law, not only that
those, who conspire to remove the king out
of the government altogether, but that those
who conspire to remove him, unless he will
govern the people according to laws, which
are not statutes in parliament agreed upon,
and the laws and customs of the same, or as
the head of a government framed and modi-
fied by any authority not derived from that
parliament, do conspire to depose him from
that royal state, title, power, and government,
which the indictment mentions, and to sub-
vert and alter the rule and government now
established in these kingdoms. He ought not
so to govern—I say he cannot so govern—he
is bound to resist such a project at the hazard
of all its consequences; he must resist the
attempt; resistance necessarily produces de-
position, it endangers his lite.

Gentlemen, to that king, upon whom these
duties attach, the law and constitution, for
the better execution of them, have assigned
various counsellors, and responsible advisers :
they have clothed him, under various consti-
tutional checks and restrictions, with various
attributes and prerogatives, as necessary for


the support and maintenance of the civil li-
berties of the people: they ascribe to him
sovereignty, imperial dignity, and perfection :
and because the rule and government, as es-
tablished in this kingdom, cannot exist for @
moment without a person filling that office,
and able to execute all the duties from time
to time, which I have now stated, they as-
cribe to him also that he never ceases to exist..
In foreign affairs, the delegate and represen-
tative of his people, he makes war and peace,
leagues and treaties: In domestic concerns,
he has prerogatives, as a constituent part of
the supreme Tegislature ; the prerogative of
raising fleets and armies: he is the fountain
of justice, bound to administer it to his peo-
ple, because it is due to them; the great con-
servator of public peace, bound to maintain
and vindicate it; every where present, that
these duties may no where fail of being dis-
charged; the fountain of honour, oflice, and
privilege ; the arbiter of domestic commerce,
the head of the national church.

Gentlemen, I hope I shall not be thought
to mispend your time in stating thus much,
because it appears to me that the fact, that
such is the character, that such are the duties,
that such are the attributes and prerogatives
of the king in this country (all existing for
the protection, security, and happiness of the
people in an established form of governmen}),
accounts for the just anxiety, bordering upon
jealousy, with which the law watches over
his person—accounts for the fact that, in
every indictment, the compassing or imagin-
ing his destruction, or deposition, seems to
be considered as necessarily co-existing with
an intention to subvert the rule and govern-
ment established in the country: it is a pur-
pose to destroy and to depose Aim, in whom the
supreme power, rule, and government, under
constitutional checks and limitations, is
vested, and by whom, with consent and ad-
vice in some cases, and with advice in all
cases, the exercise of this constitutional power
is to be carried on.

Gentlemen, this language, the tenor and
charge of every indictment, is most clearly
expressed by lord Hale, when he says that
high treason is an offence more immediately
against the person and gorernment of the
king: I cannot state it more strongly to you,
or from an authority, the authenticity of
which will be less questioned by those who
are to defend the prisoner at the bar, than
when I state to you the language of one of
the counsel for lord George Gordon upon the
last trial for high treason: indeed itis no
more than what follows the law of England
as delivered by all those great lawyers, whosc
authority, I am persuaded, will not be at-
tempted to be shaken in the course of this .
trial, when it states this principle thus :—
“To compass or imagine the death of the
king, such imagination or purpose of the
mind, visible only to its great Author, being
manifested by some open act, an institution

obviously directed not only to the security of
his natural person, but to the stability of the
government, the life of the prince being so
Interwoven with the constitution of the state
that an attempt to destroy the one is justly
held to_be a rebellious conspiracy against the
other,””*

Gentlemen, it will be my duty to state to
you presently what is in law an attempt
against the life of the king. It seems, there-
fore, that when the ancient law of England,
—and I would beg your attention to what
I am now stating to you,—that when
the ancient law of England was changed,
which, even in the case of a subject, held the
intent to kill homicide,-as well as, in the case
of the king, the intent to kill or depose, with-
out the fact, where a measure was taken to
effectuate the intent, treason, with a difference
however as to the nature of the acts deemed
sufficient, in the one case, or in the other, to
manifest the one or the other intent, that to
use the words of a great and venerable autho-
nity, I mean Mr. Justice Foster, “ it was with
great propricty that the statute of treason
retained the rigour of the law in its full extent
in the case of the king. In the case of him,”
says he, “ whose life must not be endangered,
because it cannot be taken away by treasona-
ble practices, without involving a nation in
blood and confusion: levelled at him, the
stroke is levelled at the public tranquillity.”+

Gentlemen, that it may be fully understood
what it is that I have to contend for in the
course of this trial, I put you in mind again
that I have before stated, that, as it is abso-
lutely necessary to the security of individuals,
Notless necessary to the security of individuals,
than it is necessary to the security of the
nation which they compese, that the person
and government of the king should be thus
defended ; on the other Pie i for the security
of the subject, it is equally necessary that
the crime of high treason should not be inde-
terminate, that it should not be unascertained,
or undefined, either in the law itself, or in the
construction to be made of that law.

Gentlemen, this necessity is not to be col-
lected merely in this country from reasoning,
though it may obviously enough be collected
from reasoning ; the experience of your ances-
tors has informed you, I admit it, and I beg
to press it upon your attention, as much as
any man in this court can press it upon your
attention, the experience of your ancestors
has informed you, in the just and bitter com-
plaints which are to be found in thcir annals,
of the periods, in which no man knew how
he ought to behave himself, todo, speak, or
say, for doubt of pains of treason,—in the
anxiety with which the statute of Edward Srd
reserved the judgment of all treasons not
there expressly specified—* that the justices



should tarry without going to judgment of the
treason, till the cause be showed and declared
before the king and his pannel ;”—in the
expressive language, which your ancestors
have used, when the provisions of the statute
of Edward were first introduced into the code
of law under which we live, and of those
statutes, by which treasons were brought
back to the provisions of that statute, the
experience of your ancestors, thus handed
down to you, has demonstrated this necessity.
I admit too (and my treating the subject thus
in the outset may ultimately save your bathe
that before the statute was made, upon whic!
the indictment proceeds, the security of the
subject was not sufficiently provided for. I
admit that security is not sufficiently provided
for now, if construction can be allowed to
give an exposition to the statute, which the
legislature did not intend it should receive.

Gentlemen, upon each of these heads it
was necessary for me to trouble you with
some, and but with a few observations.

That the law of treason should be deter-
minate and certain, though clearly necessary
for the security of the subject, is not more
necessary for their security, than that there
should be a law of treason, and that this law
should be faithfully, duly, and firmly exe-
cuted.

Gentlemen, every state must have some
form or regimen of government; in other
words, it must determine by whom, and under
what modifications, the sovereign power is to
be exercised in the country; tor no govern-
ment can exist, unless this power is placed
somewhere: and the attempt to subvert that
power is, in the nature of the thing, an
attempt to subvert the established govern-
ment. It is of necessity that an attempt of
this sort should be guarded against, by severer
penalties than offences, which being breaches
of particular laws, do not endanger the very
existence of the state itself, which do not
involve, in the destruction of the state, the
destruction of all laws, but which leave the
law, though violated in particular cases, suffi-
cient, in general cases, for the protection of
the personal security, the liberty, and happi-
ness of the subject.

Gentlemen, this is also the reasoning of
that great judge, whose name I before men-
tioned to you, my lord Hale :—* The great-
ness of the offence,” he says, “and the
severity of the punishment, is upon these
reasons:—First, because the safety, peace,
and tranquillity of the kingdom is highly con-
cerned in the safety and preservation of the
person, dignity, and government of the king,
and therefore the laws of the kingdom have
given all possible security to the king’s person
and government, and under the severest
penalties.”*

Gentlemen, to describe this great offence
with precision and accuracy, was what the


legislature in Edward's time proposed, when
they enacted the sacred statute upon which
this indictment is founded; that statute was
made for the more precise definition of this
crime, which, by the common law, had not
been sufficiently extended, and “ the plain
anextended letter of it,” you will mark the
words, “ the plain unextended letter of it was
thought to be a sufficient protection to the
person and honour of the sovereign;” but not
only to the person and honour of the sove-
reign, but “ an adequate security to the laws
committed to his execution.”

* Gentlemen, in addressing a jury if a court
of law, sworn to make deliverance according
to that law which constitutes the court in
which they sit, there are two propositions,
which appear to nf to be alike clear:—the
first is, that I ought not, that I cannot dare to
call upon you to say, that there has been
committed under this statute any offence, if
the facts of the case to be laid before you, by
plain, manifest, authorized interpretation of
the statute, do not constitute an offence
under it;—if the statute should seem to any
man, or to you, not to be a sufficient and
adequate security to the person and honour
of the sovereign, and the due execution of the
laws, it is nevertheless all the security which
the law has authorized you to give them, and
God forbid that you should think of giving
more. On the other hand, you are bound by
your oaths, if this law has been violated in
fact, if the fact of violation is proved by
evidence, convincing in its nature, and such
in its form as the law requires (for the law in
this case requires not only convincing, but
formal cvidence), then you are bound to give
to the person and honour of the sovereign,
and to the laws of your country, that protec-
tion, which a verdict, asserting in substance
that the statute has been violated, would give,
and which the statute intended should be
given.

Gentlemen, men of honour and of con-
science, acting under the sanction of the oath
which they have taken, must come to the
same conclusion, judging of the same facts,
by the same law, whatever their principles of
government may be, unless they differ upon
the effect of the tacts laid before them. In the
trial of a person, whose name I shall have
abundant reason to mention to you in the
course of this proceeding, I mean the author
of the Rights of Man, charged with a libel
against the monarchy of the country, it was
judiciously, truly, justly, and strongly ad-
Mnitted in effect, that, if the jury had been
composed (if there are twelve such men in
this country) of republicans, wishing to over-
turn the government of the country, yet
administering the law of England, in a court
of English law, if they were convinced that
the crime had, according to that law, been
‘committed, no man would have the audacity
to say that they. could be capable of that
‘crime against the public, to think for a


moment of not coming to the conclusion,
which the facts called for, according to the
law by which they were sworn to decide upon
the matter before them.*

Gentlemen, the statute upon which this
indictment proceeds, is to the following effect :
—it states (and it states most truly), “ that
divers opinions had been had before this
time,” that is, the 25th Edward Srd, “ in what
case treason should be said, and in what not :
the king, at the request of the Lords and of
the Commons, hath made a declaration in the
manner as hereafter followeth, that is to say,
when a man doth compass or imagine the
death of our lord the king, or of our lady his
queen, or of their eldest son and heir; or ifa
man do violate the king’s companion, or the
king’s eldest daughter, upmarricd, or the wife
of the king’s eldest son and heir ; or if a man
do levy war against our lord the king in his
tealm, or be adherent to the king’s enemies
in his realm, giving to them aid and comfort
in the realm or elsewhere, and thereof be
provably attainted”—by which words I under-
stand be attainted by evidence, that clearly
and forcibly satisfies the minds and con-
sciences of those who are to try the fact—
“attainted of open deed by people of their
condition,”—then there is this, to which you
will be bound to give your attention for the
sake of the prisoner, as well as for the sake of
the public, the interests of both being blended
in this great cause;—‘‘ and because that
many other like cases of treason may happen
in time to come, which a man cannot think
nor declare at this present time, it is accorded
that, if any other case, supposed treason,
which is not above specified, doth happen
before any justices, the justices shall tarry
without any going to judgment of the treason
till the cause be showed and declared before
the king and his parliament, whether it
ought to he judged treason, or other felony.”

Gentlemen, I desire to point out here, in
the most marked way in which I can state it,
the anxiety, with which the parliament
wished to preserve to itself the judgments of
treasons, not being the specified treasons in
the statute, but being like treasons, those
which, by a parity of reasoning. might be said
to be treason. They would not trust the sub-
jects of the country in the hand of any court
of justice upon that point I mark the cir-
cumstance, because it appears to me to give a
degree of authority to the law of England
upon the subject of treason, and to the con-
structions, which have been made upon it,
and to the distinctions, which have been made
between like treasons, and overt acts of the
same treason, that perhaps does not belong
to constructions and distinctions adopted in
the course of judicial proceedings upon any
other law in the statute-book.

Gentlemen, having read the statute to you,



it is not unimportant, as it seems to me, to
observe that lord Hale and Mr. Justice Foster,
who have stated the judicial and other expo-
Sitions of this statute, have stated them, and
have expounded the statute, under the
weighty caution, which they most powerfull
express: under the solemn protests, whic!
they most strongly state, against extending
this statute by a parity of reason. This cir-
cumstance alone appears to me to give infi-
nite authenticity to the expositions, which
they state of it, as sound, and as being such
as, according to the interpretation, which the
legislature in Edward Srd‘s time meant,
should be put upon this statute.

Gentlemen, I think it may also save your
time, and that of the Court, if I trouble you
here by reading, before I state to you the ex-
positions of the statute which lord Hale has
given us, deducing them from judgments
which had been actually made in the history
of the country, the language which he holds,
as describing the obligations, which courts of
justice, and men looking at this statute for
the purpose of executing it, are under, to con-
strue it according to the real specified mean-
ing, not by a parity of construction as to the
treason itself, when they came to construe it.

Lord Hale states it thus :—“ Although the
crime of high treason is the greatest crime
against faith, duty, and human society, and
brings with it the greatest and most fatal
dangers tu the government, peace, and happi-
ness of a kingdom or state, and therefore is
deservedly branded with the highest igno-
miny, and subjected to the greatest penalties

t the law can inflict, yet by these instances”
—he is stating those that had occurred before
the statute of Edward Srd and between that
and the first of Henry 4th—* yet by these in-
stances, and more of this kind that might be
given, it appears—first, how necessary it was
that there should be some fixed and settled

dary for this great crime of treason, and
of what great importance the statute of the
25th of Edward 3rd. was in order. to that
end; secondly, how dangerous it is to depart
from the letter of that statute, and to multiply
and enhance crimes into treason by ambigu-
ous and general words—as accroaching of
royal power, subverting of fundamental laws,
and the like; and thirdly, how dangerous it
is by construction and analogy to make trea-
sons, where the letter of the Law has not done
it, for such a method admits of no limits or
bounds, but runs as far as the wit and inven-
tion of accusers, and the odiousness and de-
testation of persons accused, will carry
men.”*

In another passage, after having given his
comment upon this statute—after havin;
stated what are the overt acts, which fa
witbin the letter of it, and the sound inter-
pretation of it, he says, “It has been the
SS —— — eee

* Conclusion of chapter 11, part 1, of


t wisdom and care of the parliament to
Eoep judges within the bounds and express
limits of this act, and not to suffer them to
run out upon their own opinions into con-
structive treasons, though in cases that seem
to have a parity of reason (like cases of trea-
son), but reserves them to the decision of pare
liament. This is a great security as well as
direction to judges, and a great safeguard even
to this sacred act itself; and therefore, as be-
fore I observed, in the chapter of levying
of war, this clause of the statute leaves a
weighty memento for judges to be carcful
that they be not over-hasty in letting in con-
structive or interpretative treasons, not within
the letter of the law, at least in such new
cases as have not been formerly expressly re-
solved, and settled by mere than one prece-
dent.” *

Gentlemen of the jury, Iam persuaded, as
those were persuaded who conducted the de-
fence of lord George Gordon, that we live in
days, in which the judges of the country nei-
ther have the inclination nor the courage to
stretch the law beyond its limits. I think
myself bound to state that; and those, who
dare to state the contrary in any place, do not
do the justice to the country, which is due
from every individual in it.

Gentlemen, having stated thus much to
you, I now state, in order to be perfectly un-
derstood, that I do most distinctly disavow
making any charge of constructive treason ;
that Ido most distinctly disavow stating in
this indictment any like case ¥ treason not
specified in the statute; that I do most dis-
tinctly disavow stating any thing that can be
called cumulative treason or analogous treason ;
thatI do most distinctly disavow enhancing
any thing, by a parity of reason, into treason,
which is not specified in that statute ; that I do
most distinctly disavow enhancing crimes of
any kind, or a life spent in crimes, if you
choose so to put it, into treason, if it be not
treason specified in the statute ; and the ques-
tion between us I state distinctly to he this—
Whether the defendant is guilty of a treason
specified in the statute, and whether the evi-

lence that is to be brought before you amounts
to that proof, that will te satisfactory to your
minds and consciences, your minds and con-
sciences being prepared to admit no proof,
but what you think you ought to reccive
under the obligation of an oath, proof high
enough that he may be “ provably attainted
of open deed,” of a treason specified in the
statute,

Then, gentlemen, to state the charge to
you :—The indictment charges the defendant
with compassing and imagining the king’s
death, and with having taken measures to
effectuate that purpose — Now, that it may be
thoroughly understood, you will permit me to
state to you here, that there is not only a ma-
nifest distinction in reason, but a settled dis-


tinction in the course of judicial practice, set-
tled for no other cause but that it was a ma-
nifest distinction in reason, between—“ like
cases of treason,” constructive, analogous, or
cumulative treasons, and various overt acts
of the same treason.

Gentlemen, whether the acts laid as overt
acts of treason, specified in the statute, and
specae! in the indictment, amount, in all

eir circumstances, to an open deed, or deeds
by which a ae may be provably attainted
of the specified treason, is the question which
ajury are to try. To explain myself upon
this, I take it to be clear, and I will not, in
this stage of the business at least, enter into |
the discussion of what I call the clear and
established law of England, hecause I will not
in a case of high treason, any more than I
would in a dispute about the estate of any
gentleman who hears me, for the purpose of
arguing points, enter into discussions upon
what I take to be the clear and established
law of England; and not only the security of
the subject in this respect cannot, but the se-
santo the subject in no respect, in his per-
son, his life, or his property, can be taken to
exist in this country, if I am not as fully au-
thorized to state to you, with as much confi-
dence, what the law Is, incase of treason, from
the decisions, which for centuries have heen
tnade in courts respecting it, as [am to state
to you, from decisions of courts respecting |
proneny> what the law of property is. I say,

take it to be clear that deposing the king,

entering into measures for deposing the king, |

conspiring with foreigners and others to in-
wade the kingdom, going to a foreign country
to procure the invasion of the kingdom, or pro-
posing to go there to that end, and taking
any step in order thereto—conspiring to raise
an insurrection, either to dethrone the king,
imprison the king, or oblige him to alter his
measures of government, orto compel him to
remove evil counsellors from him, are, and
have all been held, as Mr. Justice Foster says,
to be deetls proving an intent to do that trea-
son, which is mentioned in the statute to be
overt acts of treason in compassing the king’s
death,

It would he very extraordinary if these great
judges, Foster and Hale, after holding the lan-
guage they have stated, were to be represent-
ed by any man, as not acting themselves un-
der the effect and influence of that weighty
memento, which they held out to those who
“were to succecd them in the seat of judgment;
yet I state all this to you in the words in
which ‘these learned judges have handed
‘down the exposition of the statute, who would
have suffered death, for they both valued the
liberties of their country, before they would
have. charged “a like case of treason” in an
indictment; and yet they have concurred (as
‘all the judges of England have done, and the
parliament into the bargain) in the construc-
-tion and exposition of the statute (and in fact
executions have been made upon it), that all


these things are overt acts of the same trea-
son, that is specified in the statute. What is
the reason of it? because the law holds that
he, who does an act, meaning to do it, which
may endanger the king’s lite, compasses and
imagines the death of the king, if he does an
act which may endanger his lite, if im the or-
dinary course of things, and according to the
common experience of mankind, the measure
which he takes, in pursuance of a purpose to
take it, will bring the king to his grave.

This therefore is not raising constructive
treason, it is not raising treason by analogy,
it is not stating “ like cases of treason” not
specified in, but reserved by the statute to the
judgment of parliament, but it is stating overt
acts, which are measures taken in pursuance
of treasonable purposes, which measures
must necessarily be as various in their kinds,
asthe ways and means, by which, in facts
and open deeds, taken in pursuance of its
purposes, the human heart manifests its in-
tent to commit some one or other of the trea-
sons specified in the statute.

Gentlemen, the reserving clause in the act
is extremely material; and, if courts and ju-
ries have done wrong in the manner in which
they have executed this statute, if the inter.
pretatons, which they have made of the sta-
tute, are not right, they have done it against
a prohibition in the statute, which they were
called upon by their oaths duly to expound,
and they have done it in the presence and
: under the eye of that parliament, which had
expressly forbidden them to doit. I say the
conelusion upon that is, that they have done
it rightly.

Gentlemen, the judgments of the courts of
law are in this country perfectly familiar to
parliavent. Acts have been made, over and
over agiin, in order to bring back the exposi-
tions of the Jaw to the true construction, to
the letter, which is the true construction, in a
; sound Judicial sense, to bring it back again
| to the statute of Edward Srd; but we have
lived to this hour without parliament think-
ing that they were tomake so perfectly a dead
letter of the letter of the statute, as that they
should say that an overt act, which expressed
and inported the imagination of the mind to
do the treason specified, should not be taken
to be anact of high treason within the sta-
tute ; because the statute only mentions the
thing which is to be compassed and imagined,
and doc: not mention the ways and means,
by whick the human heart may show and
manifest that it does compass and imagine
what thestatute speaks of. .

Gentlanen, this is not all, because this is
not only iccording to the law of England, as
itis admnistered in courts of justice, but also
to the preceedings in parliament, which are a
parliameatary exposition, if 1 may so state it,
of the lav. Proceedings in parliament have
been had where the statute has been thus
construe, and where this distinction that I
am statirg between overt acts of the specified



[236

treason and the “ like cases of treason,” has { the indictment lays the imagining and com.

been expressly taken, expressly acted upon,
proposed by one house of the legislature to
the other house, and acted upon by the crown
in executing the sentences of that house.
Gentlemen, the distinction then is only this
—“a like case of treason” is a case of treason
not specified in the statute, a case of the like
mischief, as a case specified in the statute;
but the identical case specified in the statute
must be before yuu, or, to avoid all dispute

upon the subject, I say, if it be a case that is |
not specified in the statute, it is a case that .
must be shown to parliament according to the |

directions of the statute: but that facts alike
in their nature, that open deeds alike in their
nature and tendency, however various in their
circumstances, may prove the same intention

to exist in the minds of those who do them, |

and may be measures, taken in pursuance of

the same purpose, and to effectuate the same |

thing, is a distinction that appears to my mind
to be perfectly obvious.
Gentlemen, I conccive, therefore, that the
uestion of compassing the king’s death is
this—whether the jury are fully satisticd,
conscientiously satisfied, that they have that
evidence, by which they find that the acts,
laid as overt acts of compassing the parti-
cular specified treason mentioned in the in-
dictment, were measures taken in pursuance
of and to effectuate that treason, specified at
once in the statute and in the indictment.
Gentlemen, I protest for mysclf I am sorry
to trouble you thus much at large by general
reasoning, but you will find that it has an
application, and a close application, to the
ease. This is an important public cause, and
therefore we should be thoroughly understood,
I cannot understand what constructive overt
actsmean, though I do understand constructive
treasons. Levying war against the kng, not
against his person, but against his roya. majes-
ty, is constructive treason ; thatis, if menassem-
ble together without any intent to do an act,
which in the natural consequence of things
will affect the king's life, such as pullingdown
all prisons or houses of any other descristion,
that is constructive treason, it being, by con-
struction, as Mr. Justice Foster says, against
the king’s royal majesty, not levied against
his person : not one of the acts of a more fla-
gitious kind, wilfully done or attempted to be
ne, by which the king’s life may he in dan-
ger, but which are levelled against lis royal
majesty; these have by construction been
held to be treason: but even these he legis-
lature has never considered as not atthorized
by the letter of the statute ; these tley have
permitted to be proceeded upon in the coun-
try as sound decisions and constructbns upon
the act of parliament: many have teen con-
victed upon them; execution hath ollowed ;
and no one hath ever doubted eithe: the law
or the justice of these determinations. But,
as to constructive overt acts of canpassing
and imagining the death of the king, where

(
|

passing as the offence, the overt act is not
constructive, the step taken to effectuate it
must be such an act, wiltully and deliberately
done, as must satisfy the conscience of a jury
that there was an intention, by deposing, or
otherwise, tu put the king in circumstances, in
which, according to the ordinary experience
of mankind, his life would be in danger.

Gentlemen, I have befure stated to you, for
another purpose, various acts, which are overt
acts of compassing the king’s death. I will
repeat them shortly: “ Deposing him,—en-
tering into measures to uepese him,—conspir-
ing to imprison him,”—which you observe is
an act that may be done without an actual in-
tent to put him to death—a man may con-
spire to imprison the king without an actual
intent to put him to death, but you will find
the reason why that is held to be compassing
and imagining the death of the king, with
the sanction of all times since this statute of
Edward 3rd, and with the sanction of every
species of judicial authority, which the coun-
try could give; “ to get his person into the
power of conspirators.”——Why is all this trea-
son? ‘ Because,” says Mr. Justice Fuster,
“ the care, which the law hath taken for the
personal safety of the king, is not confined to
actions or attempts of a more flagitious kind,
such as attempts either to assassinate, or to
poison, or other attempts, directly and imme-
diately aiming at his life; it is extended to
every thing, wilfully and deliberately done, or
attempted, whereby his life may be endan-
gered ; and therefore the entering ints mea-
sures for depusing, or imprisoning hira, or to
get his persun into the power of the conspi-
rators,—these offences are overt acts of trea-
son within this branch of the statute; for ex-
perience hath shown that between the prisons
and the graves of princes the distance is very
small,”* and expericnce has not grown weaker
upon this subject in modern times; offences
which are not so personal as those already
mentioned, have been, with great propriety,
brought within the same rule, as having a
tendency, though not so immediate, to the
same fatal end.

Lord Hale, upon this, says, “ Though the
conspiracy be not immediately, and directly,
and expressly the death of the king, but the
conspiracy is of something that in all proba-
bility must induce it, and the overt act is of
such a thing as must induce it, this is an overt
act to prove the compassing of the king’sdeath.”
The instance he gives, as expository of his
text, is this; “If men conspire to imprison
the king by force and a strong hand till he
hath yielded to certain demands, and for that
purpose gather company, or write letters, this
is an overt act to prove the compassing of the
king's death. What is the reason? he gives
the same in substance, though different in the


terms of it, as that which has been assigned
by Mr. Justice Foster: “ for it is in effect to
despoil him of his kingly government.”®
These are the words of lord Hale; and though
the reasons given by lord Ilale and Mr.
Justice Foster are ditterent in words, they are
the same in substance. It may be said, with
equal truth, between despoiling a king of his
kingly government and the graves of kings the
distance is very small. Imprisonment is the
same as deposition, and he whu compasses the |
deposition of the king, according to all judi-
cial construction, compasses his death; it is ;
the same as deposition, because it is a tempo-
rary despoiling him of his kingly government,
which, according to this interpretation of the ;
law, usually ends in death.

Gentlemen, offences not so personal as
those enumerated fall within the same rule,
as having a tendency to the same fatal end:
if foreigners are not at war with you, the of-
fence of guing into a forcign country, or pro-
pusing to go there, or taking any step thereto
in order to invite foreigners into this king-
dui for a treasonable purpose, can only tall
within that branch of treason of compassing |
the king's death ; if they are at war with you,
then the same act amounts to another species
of treason, which is an “adhering to the
King’s enemies ;” and perhaps you will find
that the case I have to state is not without
pregnant evidence of this species of overt act.

Gentlemen, haying stated thus much to
you, I proceed now to consider the indict-
ment; and what I have stated, before I men-
tioned the substance of the indictment, I
have stated to lay in my claim to full credit
with you, when [ say, that no man living
can wish to express to you more strongly !
than I wish to do (we have indced, each of
us, as great an interest in the true construc-
tion of this law, as any other man can have
in it), that the law of treason, in consider-
ing the charge, that I have brought before
you under the command that has authorized
me to bring it here, must not be extended one
single iota beyond what is the established
law in this country, as established as the law
is, that says that the property that you
bought yesterday, you may give to whom you

lease to-morrow.

Gentlemen, the indictment, finding several
persons entitled to be tried separately, though
Indicted jointly, combined ina particular act,
which I will state by-and-hy, has charged
them with compassing the king’s death: it has
then proceeded, because the compassing and
imagination of the heart cannot be known to
man—and there must be an overt act to ma-
nifest it—it bas charged them with meeting
among themselves to cause and procure a
convention of divers subjects of the king, to
be held within this kingdom, and not only a
eonvention to be held within the Kingdom,

* Hales Pleas of the Crown, ch. 13, p. 109


but to be held with intent and in order that the
persons to be assembled at such convention and
meeting should and might, wickedly and trai«
torously, without and in defiance of the autho-
rity, and against the will of lhe parliament of
this kingdom, subvert and alter the legislature,
rule, and goocrnment established in it, and de«
pose the king from the royal state, title, power,
and gocernment thereof.

It then charges them with having com-
posed, written, and published, and caused to

e composed, written, and published, divers
books, pamphlets, letters, instructions, reso-
lutions, orders, declarations, addresses and
writings, such books, pamphlets, letters, in«
structions, resulutions, orders, declarations, ad-
dresses and writings, su respectively composed,
written, published, and caused to be composed,
written, and published, purporting and contain-
ing therein (among other things) incitements,
encouragements, and exhortations, to move,
induce, and persuade the subjects of the king
tochoose, depute, and send persons, as dele-
gates, to cumpose, not a convention, but
SUCH @ convention and mcecting, that is, a
convention to act in the manner that the first
overt act has stated it, to be holden for the traie
torous purposes befure mentioned.

It then states, as a third overt act, consul-
tations among them, how, when, and where,
such convention and meeting should be as-
sembled and held, and by what means the
subjects of the king might be induced and
moved to send persons as delegates to con-
stitute it.

It then charges, that these persons did con-
sent and agree, that Mr. Jovce and several
other persons named, should meet, confer,
and co-operate among themselves and with
other traitors, to cause the calling and assem-
bling such convention and meeting for such
traitorous purposes.

It then charges the providing of arms, of
different descriptions, fur these purposes; and
then it charges a conspiracy to make war in the
kingdom, anditchargesaconspiracy to subvert
and alter the legislature aud government of
the kingdom, and to depose the king: that
is, as I understand it, that, if you should not
be satisfied that the calling such a convention,
as is mentioned in the first part of the indict-
ment, was a mean to effectuate that com-
passing and imagination, which is mentioned
tn the introductory part of the indictment,
yet you will tind in the evidence, which is to
be laid before you, even if yor pay no‘atten-
tion to that circumstance of calling a convene
tion, sutticient evidence of a conspiracy to de-
pose the king.

It then states again, that they published
several books, and other matters of the same
kind, in order to bring about the traitcruas
purposes Jast mentioned ; and charges, as a
farther overt act, providing arms fur that
purpose.

Now, gentlemen, having before stated to
you, that a conspiracy to depose the king,—

8

and I have not stated it to you in my own
words, but in the words of the authorities I
mentioned,—that a conspiracy to depose the
king, that a conspiracy to imprison the king,
a conspiracy to procure an invasion, with
steps taken to effectuate such a conspiracy (a
conspiracy indeed itself being a step for that
purpose), is treason; you will observe that
In this indictment, a conspiracy to depose the
king is expressly charged, and, | think, it
will be clearly proved. If a conspiracy to de-
pose the king be an overt act of high treason,
permit me then to ask you, what can a conspi-
Tacy to subvert the monarchy of the country,
including in it the deposition of the king, be,
but an overtact of high treason? In the ob-
ject of such a conspiracy the king is necessa-
rily involved, and it is already shown that
conspiring to depose him is compassing his
death.

Gentlemen, read as you are in the history
of the country, give me leave to ask you, if
measures had been taken, after the Revolu-
tion, to effectuate a conspiracy to dethrone
king William, and to restore king James,
without all doubt, the measure taken, would
have constituted the crime of high treason
within the clause of compassing the king’s
death, although the conspirators could have
been shown satistactorily to have no more
meant the actual natural death of king
William, than they meant the actual natural
death of king James, whom they intended to
replace upon the throne—but what says the
law to that ;—the law says you cannot mean
to depose the king without meaning to en-
danger his life, and if you mean to endanger
his life you must abide the consequences of it.

Put it another way—lIf the project had
been to depose the same king William, and
measures had been taken upon it—not witha
view to bring back to the throne king James
2d, but merely to send back king William to
his former character of Prince of Orange, and
not to restore king James, but to restore a
commonwealth, which is what, I think I
shall satisfy you, those, who are charged by
this indictment, meant by “a full and fair
representation of the people,” whether you
eall it “ a full and fair representation of the
people in parliament,” or do not use the words
“in parliament,” can a lawyer be found to
say, that it could be stated in law, that it is
not high treason? I do not know what may
not be stated—all that I mean to say at pre-
sent is, that according to the best lights
which I can get of the law under which ¥ have
lived, it does not appear to me to be probable,
that any man will so state it. Far be it from
me, however, to have the vanity to say that
(avowing that I should certainly not think of
encountering the current authorities of the
country for centuries) I am, without the pos-
sibWity of contradiction, stating that I am
following the authorities of the country for
centuries ; but I am ready to say this, that I
cannot conceive or imagine by what species of
teasoning, or upon what principle, or upon


what authority, it is to be contended, that
this would not have been high treason.

Gentlemen, take it another way—if the
regicides ef king Charles 1st had been tried
for compassing the death of king Charles 1st,
supposing they had only deposed him, instead
of putting him to death, could they have
contended, that though they would have been
guilty of high treason if they had placed an-
other individual upon the throne (which would
have been alike to the case I have put, of
conspiring to put James in the bps of Wil
liam), could they have contended then, that
they were not guilty of high treason, because
they deposed the king without substituting an-
other king in his place; and because they left
the governmentto be filled up by the common-
wealth, without a king?

Give me leave to ask another thing—sup-
pose it had happened after king William came
to the throne, that not those events, which
did actually happen, took place, but that any
set of men in this country should have ven-
tured to meet in a convention of delegates
from aftiliated societies, for the purpose of
deposing king William, under pretence of
assembling a convention of the people, havi:
or claiming the civil and political authority of
the country, and intending to have no king in
the country, would it have been possible in
king William’s time to have contended, be-
cause they met, under pretence of being a
convention ef the people, assuming to them-
selves civil and political authority, and with
such meaning, that the conspiracy was not
as completely a cempassing the death of
king William, as if the conspiracy had been, by
the same persons, in the case of affiliated soc
eties, forming the like convention of delegates,
to bring king James again to the throne?

If I levy war in this country against the
king, with intent to bring another upon the
throne, 1 am guilty of high treason. IfI levy
war, that is an overt act of compassing the
king’s death. If I conspire to levy direct war
that is a compassing of the king’s death, um
less all the branches of the legislature have
puta man to death upon anerror. If I hold
a fortress * against the king to put another

* “ Holding a castle or fort against the
king or his troops,” says Mr. East, “ if actual
force be used in order to keep possession, is
levying war, but a bare detainer, as supposet
by shutting the gates against the king or his
troops, without any other force from within,
lord Hale conceiveth, (says Mr. Justice
Foster), will not amount totreason. The last-
mentioned judge has not told us what degree
of approbation he gives to this instance of a
detainer, which, as he says, lord Hale con-
eeives not to be within the statute.

+ To these words I find the following note
by Mr. Hargrave, in his copy of East’s P.C.
now in the lib: of the British Museum -
“ Note, that the supposed case comes from
Foster, not from Hale,” . .

upon his throne, I am guilty of high treason.
Am I guilty of no offence if I do the same acts
not for the!purpose of continuing the monarchy
of the country in another person, but for the
purpose of destroying the monarchy altoge-

‘ther? What is this but doing an act involving
in it high treason, and more? High treason
in depusing the king! more—in bringing
about all that additional anarchy, which we
know, which the experience of mankind
Proves to be consequent upon the change,
where the change is not only of the persons
who administer the government, but of the
government itself, if destruction can be called
a change?

Gentlemen, to assert therefore that mea-
sures, taken for a total subversion of the mo-
narchy of the country, including in it an in-
tention to depose the king (mark the words, I
state, including in it an intention to depose

there be not many instances of constructive
Yevying of war far short of the real guilt and
consequences of such an act, and much less
within the true meaning of the stat. 25 Ed.
Srd? Lord Hale prefaces the passage in question
thus: If B. either fortify his own house, or
the house of another, with weapons defensive
or invasive, purposely to make head against
the king, and to secure himself against the
King’s regal army or forces, then that is a
levying of war against the king. He then

roceeds. But the bare detaining of the

ing’s castles or ships seems no |
war within this statute. And his lordship
refers to a subsequent part of his work, where
he grounds his reasoning solely} on the stat.
14 Eliz. c. 1. having enacted the same thing§
during the queen’s life. This, if it stood,
alone would not be a conclusive argument, as
might be proved by many passages, as well
as by the express declaration of the same
author. Besides which, that statute was cer-
tainly creative of new treason; for it nakes
the wilful and malicious burning of the queen’s
ships treason, without any farther qualifica-
‘tion. But, most ofall, I fiud it difficult to
reconcile this opinion with the preceding part
of the passage which I have referred to; for,
supposing a treasonuble intent to exist, what
solid distinction can there be between a man's
fortifying his own or anvther’s house, pur-
posely to make head agaiust the king, and to
secure himself against the regal forces
(which is admitted to be an overt act of levy-
ing war), and the case oi one who detains the
possession of the king's own fortress against

Hargrave, ut sup.

§ “Not quite so; I apprehend lord Hale
puts the case of a bare detaining; the sta-
tute that of a detaining maliciously or rebelli-
ously with force, and not rendering the same
within six days after proclumation.” Har-
grave, ut sup,

ing of


the king), are not overt acts of compassing
the king's death, merely because the statute
of Edward 3rd, has not included all overt
acts in words, but as left to juries to determine
what are overt acts, by which they can pruva-
hly attaint—to assert that the statute does not
include the case, because it is compassing the
death of the king, and more; if this were to
be asserted ina court of justice (what is as-
serted out of a court of justice no man pays
much attention to), | should certainly say of
it, that it was the assertion of those who had
ill considered the law; and if asserted out of
a court of justice, and with a reference to what
isto be done in a court of justice, I should
say it deserved to have an observation of a
harsher kind made upon it.

This indictment, besides charging a conspi-
racy to depose the king, in express terms, of
which I shall insist before you there is abun-
dant evidence, charges a cunspiracy to call a

himself, with the same intent? for the man-
ner of puiting the first case supposes that no
resistance has been actually made. On the
contrary, is not the latter case, put by lord
Hale, as much at least within the reason and
contemplation of the stat. 25 Ed. Srd, as the
former one? Is not the act of fortifying a
private house, which may happen from caprice
of a more equivocal nature in itself than that
of a governor of a fortress refusing to deliver
it up to the king upon his summons, and
shutting the gates against him. Admitting,
that this latter is not conclusive evidence of a
traitorous intent any more than the other;
yet surely it seems suilicient to leave toa
Jury. dt is holding a castle against the
king, which is as much an act of hostility,
and a throwing off of the allegiance due to
him, as any of the ordinary preparations of
war are admitted to fall within the description
of levying war, though no act of force has
been in fact exerted. In the case of the earl
of Essex, it is even said, that keeping armed
men against the king's command 1s a levying
of war against him (but this must be under-
stood, that the purpose for which they were
armed was treasonable), which is a far less
decisive act of opposition than the other, and
Jord Hale himself, speaking in another place
of the stat. 26. LL. c. 13, says, that that part of
it whereby the rebellious detaining of the
king’s castles, after summons by proclamation
is made high treason, seems to be treason
within the stat. 25, Ed. 3rd; and both lord
Hale and Foster, J. agree, that if the bare dee
tuiner be done in contederacy with enemies or
rebels, that circwnstance will make it treason,
in the one case under the clause of adhering
to the king’s enemies, in the other under that
of levying war. The same rule applies to the
delivery up of a castle to rebels or enemies,
by treachery, and in combination with them ;
but not if it happened through cowardice or
imprudence.” 1 East's, Pleas, of the Crown
ch, 2) 5. 14

convention against the will, in defiance of, and
against the authority of parliament, for the pur-
pose of deposing the king ; it charges farther acts,
namely, that they caused to be composed and
written divers books, pamphlets, letters, in-
structions, resolutions, orders, declarations,
addresses, and writings, cuntaining incite-
ments, inducements, and exhortations, to
move, seduce, and persuade the subjects of
the king to send delegates to such convention ;
as to which [ say of many of them, though
I did not know their real character till 1 had
seen them all together, that they are both
overt acts, und evidence of overt acts of high
treason,

Now, before I state to you the particulars
of the evidence, Iam afraid I must, however
pulnfal it i8 to me to ask so great a portion of
your attention. trouble you with some gencral
observations, that I think will have a tenden-
cy to render intelligible to you the cumplicat-
ed mass of evidence, which I have to lay be-
fore you.

Gentlemen, the convention, meant to be
called by those who are charged with the
conspiracy in this indictment, was, as I col-
lect from the effect of the evidence, a conven-
tion of persons, who were to assume the cha-
racter of a convention of the people, claiming,
as such, all civil and political authority, pro-
Posing to exercise it by altering the govern-
ment, otherwise than by acts of the present
constituted legislature, otherwise than by
those statutes, according to which the king
has sworn at the hazard of his life to govern.

Gentlemen, if this is made out, it appears
to me to follow necessarily on the part of all
who took a step to assemble it, that they are
gucity of a conspiracy to depose the king, to
depose him trom the character which he holds
in the constitution of the sovereign power of
this kingdom, as by law established, that law
by which I again repeat to you, he is sworn
yo govern,

Gentlemen, if they conspired to assemble
ina convention, which was of its own autho-
rity, and against the will of the legislature,
and in defiance of it, to act as an assembly to
constitute a government, and to assume so
far sovereign power, it is, I conceive, accord-
ing to the law of England, a conspiracy to de-
pose from the sovereignty him, who under
the restraints of the constitution and the law,
now holds that sovereignty. There cannot
be two sovercign powers in a state; there may
be a complication of authorities vested in a
great variety of persons, making up one sove-
reizn power, but there cannot be two sovereign
powers ina state: itisimpoussible. Ifa mecting
assembled as a convention of the people, arro-
gating to themselves all civil and political au-
thority us such, and meaning to exercise it,
one or other of these consequences must fol-
low: the king and the parliament must be
obedient to the meeting, or the meeting, as-
scinbled as a convention, must be obedient to
flic king and parliament : if the mecting isto


be obedient to the king and parliament, it
cannot eticct its purposes; it is impossible : if
its purpose be to depose the king, I say,a
conspiracy to call such a meeting is an overt
act of high treason.

Gentlemen, I beg your attention to my ex-
pressions : if the meeting means to oblige the
king and parliament to be obedient to them
by the exertion of open force, though it may
not effect its purpose, that makes no difference,
the law must be the same—I may be wrong
Perhaps in stating the law, but it appears to
me that the law must be the same if the
meeting projects the purpose, whether the
force of the meeting is suflicient to effect the
Purpose or not.

This, I say, is a conspiracy to assume the
sovereign power: it is a conspiracy therefore
of necessity meant to depose the existing
power, and of necessity to depose the king.
I say meant to depose; for I repeat it, that
whether the conspiracy is successful or not, is
immaterial.

Gentlemen, though the particular fact of
calling such a convention, now alleged as an
overt act of treason, may be represented to be
new in the history of this country, it is not
therefore, and because it is new only inasmuch
as it is more than ordinarily audacious, less an
overt act of compassing the death or deposi-
tion of the king, if the intent of it was to sub.
vert the sovercign ruling power. .

Gentlemen, there is another distinction, ta
which I would beg your attention. It is of
no consequence whether the first meeting,
proposed to be assembled, was designed to be a
convention, thal should assume all civil and po-
litical authority, or was only to detise the means
of forming a constituent assembly, u body which
should assume it; for any act taken towards
assuming it against the will, in defiance of,
and against the authority of the king and par-
liament, and removing him from that situa+
tion in the character of sovereign, which he
has in this country; any act taken towards
the formation of a body, which was to assume
such authority, is an act of conspiring the
deposition of the king: any act towards con-
vening a national assembly, to act with so-
vereign power, not formed by the legislature,
is an act done towards deposing the king, who
now has, under the restraints of the constitu-
tion, and the provisions and limitations of the
law, the sovercign power vestedin him. You
cannot set about organizing a body, which is
thus to act, without meaning to depose the
king, without meaning to form a body that is
to usurp the powers of government.

Genticmen, I think the evidence, that I
shall lay before you, will most abundantly
satisfy you that the convention, which the
persous charged conspired to form, was a con-
vention to alter the whole form of the sove-
reign power of this country, that it was to
form, or to devise the means of forming, a re-
presentalive government—to vest in a body,
founded upon universal suffrage, and ‘the al

leged unalienable, and, as they are called, im-
prescriptible rights of man, al/ the legislative
and executive government of the country ; that
aconspiracy to this end would be an overt act
of high treason, I presume cannot be disput-
ed; it deposes the king in the destruction of

the regal office in the constitution of the -

state.

Gentlemen, I go farther: if it had been in-
tended to have retamed the name and office
of the king in the country, and to have re-
tained it in the person of the present king,
creating, however, by the authority of the in-
tended convention, a new legislature, to act
with him, provided they would allow him to
act with such new legislature, and thus calling
upon him to act against the express obliga-
tions of his cororation oath, if he could forget
it, it still would have been a conspiracy to
depose him from his royal authority, as now
established: if he refused to act, he must ne-
cessarily be deposed from that authority ; if he
did accept, he was not the king of England,
as he is established by law the king of Eng-
land. But he could not accept; he could not
so govern; he is sworn not so to govern; he
must refuse, must resist, and, in consequence
of resisting, his life must be in danger.

Take it either way, that persons conspired
to form a convention to assume all civil and
political authority, as pretending to be a con-
vention of the people (I care not with how
much audacity they pretend to be a conven-
tion of the people), or to devise the means of
constituting such a convention, in order, and
with the intent, and against the authority of
parliament, that there should be no king, or
in order to the erecting, by their own autho-
rity, a new legislature to act together with a
king, and together with the king, if they per-
mitted the present to be the king, I submit
that such a conspiracy is an overt act in the
true construction of law, and high treason in
¢ompassing the king’s death. The king must
be deposed while such a new constitution was
framing ; he could not treat with such a con-
vention till he had been deposed ; it could be
those only, that had sovereign authority, that
could frame a constitution: then he is surely,
by this, despoiled of his kingly government,
even as in a case, of temporary imprisonment.
I repeat again, that he could not, consistently
with his coronation oath, do otherwise than
reject it when framed: it must be taken for
granted he would reject it; his life, therefore,
could not but be in danger. To suppose that
such a meeting, which proposed a new con-
sutution, would depart quietly home, and not
act, if it was not accepted, is out of the reach
of all human credulity ; itis not according to
the ordinary course and experience of man-
kind, to suppose that they should meet in
numbers, and make no use of their numbers,
if the show of them did not produce the effect
intended : this is not according to the ordinary
course and experience of mankind. :

‘Gentlemen, the ‘king in his parliament


could not be the sovercign powcr the moment
the meeting could act as a national consti-
tuting assembly, or could direct, with effect,
such an assembly to meet. The power sv to
act, or to organize with effect such a meeting
that should so act, must pro tempore depose
every other power. This 1s the character of
a convention of the people, I think, as given
in the evidence I have to lay before you.
With respect to the detendant, I think I shall
satisly you he conspired to call such a conven-
tion; and that he said that the convention,
which I am to call, is irresistible, it is
unlimited, it is uncontrollable, and that by
such a convention, my full and fair represen-
talion of the people, or a full and fair repre-
sentation in parliament (if you choose to take
that expression, for it is not mere expression
that determines what men mean), is to be
accomplished.

Gentlemen, in the country in which I am
speaking, when a vacant throne was given (1
am now alluding to the time of king Willian)
by those, who, as they are stated in the Bi
of Rights, represented all the estates of the
people of this realm, to king William and
queen Mary, they, who gave it, ceased to
have or to exercise the power of sovereignty :
in that instant, as every lawyer must speak of
it, in that instant the sovereign power of this
coon became vested in the king and queen
upon the throne, to be exercised in legislation,
undoubtedly, with the advice and consent ov
parliament, formed according to the Inw and
custom of the country—incapable of being
exercised otherwise, and, as to the executive
authority, exercised under the control of pro-
visions and limitations of the law and consti-
tution, and with the advice which, in every
act which the king does, makes somebody
responsible.

I insist that the design of conspiring to
assemble the people, who were to act as a
convention of the people, claiming all civil
and political authority, or claiming power to
alter, against its will, the constituted legisia~
ture, or a mecting to form the means of bring-
ing together such @ convention so to act, Is an
attempt to create a power subversive of the
authority of the king and parliament, a power,
which he is bound by oath to resist at all
hazards. But it will not rest here: this will
be sufficiently proved; but evidence will like-
wise be offered to you as satisfactory to prove
that the express object of calling this conven-
tion, the express object of appointing a com-
mitte of conference and co-vperation, which
was to devise the means of constituting sich
a convention, was ultimately, and finally,
and in their prospect, the deposition of the
king.

Convene, beyond this, and supposing it
not to be proved, the indictment has charged
as overt acts, a conspiracy, without the mean
of a convention, and not through that
enedium, to depose the king; if that consp>
acy is made out by otheracts, though neither

a convention, assuming all political authority,
nor a meeting to devise the means of calling
a convention, which should assume all politi-
cal authority, was intended, yet the indict-
ment is made good.

Gentlemen, the indictment farther charges
as an overt act of compassing the king’s
death, which without question it is, the con-
spiracy to levy war; I do not mean con-
structive war. This I state, without question,
to be an overt act of compassing the king’s
death. A rising to oblige the king toalter his
measures of government amounts to levying
war within the statute. - A conspiracy to levy
war for this purpose is an overt act of com-
passing the king’s death. If they conspired
to form a representative government, excluding
the king entirely, which I say is the fact, or,
if they conspired not to form a representative
government, excluding the king entirely, but
yet tocompel him, by their own strength and
force, to govern with others, and without
those, which he chose to remain with him, by
whose advice and consent alone he is sworn
and bound to govern, I mean the great
council of the nation, the Lords in Parliament
assembled, the Commons in Parliament as-
sembled, according to the constitution of the
country, and to substitute against his will,
and against the will of the present constituted
authority of the country another authority,
formed on the principles of universal suffrage
and annual representation, and so formed
without the authority of parliament, I must
submit to the court, and to you, that conspir-
ing to do this would be an overt act of treason
of deposing the king, and therefore of com-
passing his death.

Gentlemen, you will also observe the
indictment has charged, and proof will be
.offered to you to make it out, that these
objects were meant to be carried by force, by
actual force.

Gentlemen, the case, as I have hitherto
represented it, is not a case aiming merely at
intimidating the legislature, and inducing it
by an act done, which was, according to the
forms of the constitution, to bury the consti-
tution in its grave, to new-mould the sovereign
power; the case goes far beyond this; appli-
cation in any shape to parliament was not
only disavowed, but the very competency of
parliament, if applied to, to make a law to
new-model the government, was disputed,
and denied; the idea of that competency was
held to be irreconcilable to the very principle
upon which these persons assembled. I
must however insist, and I mean to doit, with
the full concurrence of my bumble opinion,
that a conspiracy to compel the king, by force,

inst his will, to give his assent to an act
obtained from the Houses of Parliament in
order to alter the government and frame of
the constitution of the country, whether it
was obtained from the two Houses of Parlia-
ment, or either of them, by overawing them,
or not overawing them,—that a conspiracy,


by force, to compel the king, in the exercise
of the highest and most essential act of the
sovereignty of this country, in the act of giving
his consent to such an act,—to compel him,
by force, to do that, is unquestionably an
overt act of treason in deposing him, and in
compassing his death. Itis neither more nor
less, to explain it in a word, than to substitute
the will of those, who conspired to force him,
in the room of that royal will, in which, and
by which alone, the laws of this country, and
the constitution of this country, have said
that a bill (however obtained betore it comes
to him) shall receive the authority of a statute.

Gentlemen, I have thought it necessary to
state thus much before I come to state the
circumstances of the case, and I will state to
ae in a word why. It is not to be expected

yy persons, who execute the great and impor-
tant duty in the great and important station,
the functions of which you are now called
upon to execute, that council at the bar shall
be able to state to you law, that no man can
question the soundness of: nay, gentlemen, it
is not to be expected by you that counsel at
the bar should be able to state to you in all
cases law, which men of grave character, and
excellent understandings, of great reason, and

reat experience in their profession, may not

ispute the soundness of. It is the duty of
counsel, more particularly it is the duty of
that counsel, who ought to remember that, if,
in Pree the subject, he presses him
unfairly, he Betrays in the most essential
point the duty which he owes to the sove-
Teign: it is his duty to endeavour faithfully
and honestly to explain and expound the law,
that is, to apply to the facts of the particular
case, reasoning upon the law, according as he
is able to do it, in the exercise of painful
industry, exerted under the reflection that be
is under much obligation at least to endeavour
to represent the law truly.

Gentlemen, I have thought it my duty, in
a prosccution, the principles of which interest
the civil happiness of all mankind, to mention
distinctly and fairly what are {the principles
upon which I proceed; I have no doubt in
my own mind, but that I have stated these
doctrines as the law of England would state
them, and}I claim from you and from the
public that, in the fair exercise of my duty,
conducted under such a sense and understand-
ing of that duty, as I have now explained to

jou, you and they will do me the credit at
leat to think, that the principles which [
have stated are such as I believe to be sancs
tioned by the law of England.

Gentlemen, I shall presume for a moment,
after having read to you the indictment, and
given you that exposition of it, which I
humbly offer to your attention, that the law
has (at least, according to my judgment, it
certainly has) been complied with in this
respect; namely, the indictment has told you
with sufficient certainty what it is, that is
meant to be imputed as an overt act of com.

passing the king’s death. It is not necessary
to be disputing that now, because, if I have
failed in the due execution of my duty in that
respect, the prisoner cannot be injured by it.

Gentlemen, I have before said to you,
that, in a case of high treason, the evidence
must not only be convincing, but it must be
formal ; and, though the object of the security
of the person and government of the king is
the highest object that the law has looked to,
yet I must, at the same time, inform you,
that the law for the security of the public
which is in truth part of the object involved
in the object of the security of the person and
government of the king—is essentially united
with it—and inseparable from it: the law has
required not only that you shall have one
witness, if he were the most credible man in
the world, to give convincing evidence of the
fact, but that that convincing evidence must
be rendered yet more conclusive by the testi-
mony of two witnesses; that you should at
least have one witness to one overt act, and
another to another overt act of the same
species of treason.

Gentlemen, having stated to you the pro-
ject, in a general way, to which I apprehend
this indictment applies, I presume that you
may possibly reason thus: When this indict-
ment charges, that these persons compassed
the death of the king, and to depose him,—
that they conspired to assemble a convention
in defiance of the authority of parliament,—
to subvert the rule and government of the
kingdom, against the will and in defiance of
the legislature,—to dethrone the monarch,
reigning in the ‘hearts of a great majority of
his people, you will naturally ask,—by what
Process was it, that such persons as these
could effectuate such a purpose? When the
indictment charges, that they composed a
great variety of books, containing incitements
to choose persons, as delegates, to compose a
convention for such traitorous purposes,—in
what language, you will naturally ask, could
such incitements to such a momentous project,
have been conveyed, and to whom could that
language have been addressed? When it
charges, that they met, and deliberated
among themselves, together with divers other
false traitors,—at what time, in what manner,
and in what place, it may be asked, have
these people met to deliberate upon that pro-
ject, for the accomplishment of which somany
persons must be engaged?—By what means
were they to bring together the subjects of
the country, to send delegates to such a
traitorous convention, to assume such sove-
reign power? This sort of question may be
pursued. I shall not pursue it by observa-
tions upon every overt act in this indictment.

Now, gentlemen, my answer to this isa
short one. I think it will be proved to your
Satisfaction, that, as they meant, in the
words of the act of parliament, to introduce
that system of misery and anarchy, which
Prevailed.in France, they meant to introduce


it by the same means,—to proceed upon the
same principles to the same end,—and by the
same acts to execute the same purposes.
Gentleinen, if the experience of Europe had
not manifested what has passed in France
(and this project might perhaps be brought
from France into Great Britain by but an in-
dividual or two), if that experience had not
shown us what has passed in France, to the
destruction of its old government—to the de-
struction alike of that government which
they substituted in the room of its old go-
vernment—and which, in the last act of its
Power, protested against the existence of
clubs, as incompatible with the security of
any country, I say, till the subversion of go-
vernment in France took place, and upon
principles, to a blind admiration of which in
this country,—a country which, under the pee
culiar favour of Providence, is alike in its
blessings, as it is inits situation, ‘ toto divisos
orbe Britunnos,” we have found a disposition
to sacrifice all those blessings—it could not
perhaps have entered into the heart of man
to conceive, that a project so extensive should
have been set on fick by persons in number
so few;—that a project, existing almost every
where, should yet be visible no where ;—that
a project should be so deeply combined, and
complicated,—should exist to such an almost
inconceivable extent,—should be formed with
so much political craft—it could not enter
into the heart of man to conceive, that it
should have existed in any country, much
less, that it was possible that it should exist
in this country of Great Britain to the extent
in which I am sure, whatever your verdict
may say upon the guilt of the prisoner, you
will be satisfied it has existed in this country.
But the law of England does not require
that any such case as this should be proved
before you. If you are satisfied that what
the indictment charges was imagined, and
that a step was taken to effectuate that
intent, it is enough—it is not the extent, in
which the project was proceeded upon—it is
not the extent to which the project was
Tuinous —it is not necessary to prove, that the
Means were as competent to the end pro-
posed, as they were thought to.be, by those
who used them. No, gentlemen, the provi-
dence of the law steps in upon their first mo-
tion, whether they furnish themselves with
means adequate or inadequate to their pur-
poses—the law steps in then, conceiving its
rovidence at that moment to be necessary
be the safety of the king and the security of
the subject.
The project, the general character of which
I shall give you, proving it by the particular
facts, and applying the particular facts (for I
have no right to give you the general project,
unless I can so apply the particular facts) to
the person now accused, seems to me to have
been this.. Imported from France in the
latter end of the year 1791 or 1792, by whom
brought hither : does not much matter, the

intent was to constitute in London, with
alliliated societies in the country, clubs which
were to govern this country upon the princi-
ples of the French government, the alleged
unalienable, imprescriptible rights of man,
such, as they are stated to be, inconsistent in
the very nature of them with the being of a
king or of lords in a government—deposing,
therefore, the moment they come into execu-
tion, in the act of creating a sovereign power,
either mediatcly or immediately, the king,
and introducing a republican government
with a right of eternal reform, and thercfore
with a prospect of eternat revolution.

Gentlemen, we have all heard of a club
called the Jacobin Club at Paris. This, with
its affiliated societies,—however impossible it
was thought that it should effect such things,
—however wild the man would have been
thought, into whose head such an imagina-
tion could have entered as that it could effect
them, first overset the old constitution, then
introduced another, which could not exist
upon the principles which gave it birth, and
has finally introduced government after go-
vernmeat, till it has at last Ieft the country
in that undescribable state of things in which
‘we now see it.

Gentlemen, the great end of the persons
concerned in this project, though not alto-
gether visible, or not much disclosed upon its
first formation, was, when they had sufli-
ciently diffused their principles through this
country, by artifice,—by union,—by combi-
nation, — by affiliation, —by fraternization
(those who formed the project, whuever they
were, endeavouring tu force it into execution
by means which perhaps would shock the
minds of men that are not always dwelling
upon political subjects), to assemble a con-
vention of delegutes from clubs, to assume
the power of the people, supported in the
assumption and exercise of that power by
the individual members of the afhliated so-
cicties, and by their combined strength.

Gentlemen, we have no occasion in this
cause to-be disputing upon abstract questions,
as to the power of the people to change their
government. I state to you, that the inten-
tion was, to.asscmble a convention of dele-
gates from those clubs, to assume the powers
of government. The people, the infinite ma-
jority of the people adverse to any change,
distinguishing between abuses in the admi-
nistration of the government, and vices in the
form of the government administered, nay,
ardently attached to the old government,
must have been averse to have been subdued
by a convention of the delegates from these
societies, who meant to have assumed the re-
presentation of the people, and to have exer-
cised the powers which they stated to be in-
herent in those whom they professed to re-
present.

Gentlemen, it is not difficult to conceive,
after what has happened in fact in France,
how it should happen that the opinion of these


fraternizing societies should have the force of
the will of a majority of the nation, though
they constitulcd a vast and infinite minority
indeed. You will tind, in the evidence to be
laid before you, that it was perfectly under-
stood how this might be by those who are
named in this indictment. The great bulk of
the community, engaged in different pursuits,
are therefore incapable of being combined in
opposition to the execution of a purpose,
which is to be brought about by great bodies
of men, that are combined. I need not give
you a stronger instance of it than this :—It is
within the memory of most of us living, that
a few thousand men in St. George’s-fields,
combined in one purpose, reduced this metro-
polis to an absolute state of anarchy, a state
in which no government existed.* If any
man had been asked, a fortnight before the
event to which I am now alluding, Is it pos-
sible for four or five thousand men to assem-
ble in St. George’s-fields, and to rob and
plunder every body they choose in London
and ten miles round it? That would have
been thought utterly impossible—but yet it
happened—why? because a combination of
the few will subdue the many, who are not
combined, and with great facility; and com-
bined bodies of men have had, as you will
find, an existence in this country, to an ex-
tent which few men had any idea of. .

You will find them organized,—prepared
for emergencies and exigencies,—relying upon
their own strength,—determined to act upon
their combined strength, in a system of act-
ing together,—in some instances acting with
a secrecy calculated to elude observation—in
other instances, procceding, by directly con-
trary meaus, to the same end,—representing
their numbers as greater than they were, an
therefore increasing their number by the very
operation of the intluence of the appearance
of strength upon the minds of others, without
a possibility that that misrepresentation should
be set right. You will find them intlaming
the ignorant, under pretence of enlightening
them ;—debauching their principles towards
their country, under pretence of infusing po~
litical knowledge into them; —addressing
themselves principally to those whose rights,
whose interests are, in the eye uf the law and
constitution of England, as valuable as those
of any men, but whose education does nut
enable them immediately to distinguish be-
tween political truth and the misrepresenta-
tions held out to them,—working upon the
passions of men, whom Providence hath
placed in the lower, but useful, and highly
respectable situations of life, to irritate them
against all whom its bounty hath blessed by
assigning to them situations of rank and pro-
perty,—representing them as their oppressors,
as their enemies, as their plunderers, as those
whom they should not suffer to exist;—and,



in order, at the same time, to shut out the
possibility of correcting original error, or rec-
tifying the opinions of those whom they had
so inflamed, misinformed, debauched, and
misled, not admitting them into these affi-
liated societies till they had subscribed tests—
the principles of which they were not to exa-
mine after they bad been admitted, but the
principles of which they were to carry into
execution, when assembled in a convention
to carry into execution those principles, as
acting for the people, by a great majority of
whom they were held in utter detestation.
Gentlemen, to say that an act done was
meant to be done as a means taken in the
execution of such a project as this is, till the
person, who takes it, thinks the scheme prac-
ticable, I admit is not reasonable, but -un-
doubtedly he may think it practicable long
before it is really so. Now, you will be abun-
dantly satisfied, that these conspirators thought
that the time was now come—that the time
for a convention, which had been the object
of anxious expectation, doubting for a year or
two whether it would ever be gratified, that
that time was now come, and the measures
taken were taken upon that snnposten
that the Se ereny had arrived, which, if
not laid hold of now, would be lost for ever.
Gentlemen, the people of this country have
in general a rooted attachment to its govern-
ment. The public opinion of government is
in this country, as well as in every other, its
principal support: and therefore it became
necessary to infuse, where so much could be
safely suggested, where the mind was pre-
pores for it, an opinion, thut the form of the
ritish government was radically vicious—
that it was-founded on principles of oppres-
sion—that it was founded on the destruction
of natural, imprescriptible, and unalienable
rights. —With others, you will find, they
thought it necessary to use a little more cau-.
tion— not to alarm them, but to humour their
attachment to the form of the constitution,
by taking advantage of well-meaning igno-
rance, under pretence of instructing it, to en-
list them also alike in the project of destroy-
ing that constitution to which they were at-
tached. To them, therefore, the form of the
government was not spoken of in terms which
they might understand to be a condemnation
of it, though they were really such, but by
making use of general expressions, such as
obtaining “a full and fair representation of
the people in patliament”—" a full representa-
tion of the people,” sometimes without men-
tion of parliament—never with actual mention
of the King and Lords, as co-existing together
with parliament; by using terms, which cer-
tainly may mean what it may be contended
in the defence they did mean; but terms the
same in their expression, certainly the same
in their import, as those which were used _in
every act which passed in this country during
the time of the Commonwealth, when we
neither had King nor Lorde; that may sig-


nify a government existing without Lords or
King, by declaring the obtaining such a re-
presentation of the people as necessary to the
natural, unalienable, imprescriptible rights of
man, as stated by Mr. Paine: by these means
and artifices, they attempted to engage in
their service the physical strength of men

who might not and did not discover the real
nature of the plan, which that strength was
to be employed in executing; who fad not
information enough to discover what the re-
presentation was meant finally todo or to
execute. But you will find the persons mem
tioned in this indictment had no doubt about
it. I mark these circumstances to you, be-
cause, in the evidence that is to be laid before
you (and I am now stating the general cha-
racter of the evidence, and not the principles
upon which the charge is made), in the evi-
dence to be laid before you of the plan for the
execution of these purposes, some very re-
matkable particulars occur; and when you
éome to decide upon this case, I humbly hes
your attention to those particulars; some very
remarkable particulars will occur.

You will find that the ledding clubs, by
which I mean the Constitutional Society,
judging of its conduct for the purpose of this
cause, though in some other cases we must
go farther back, but, for the purpose of this
cause, judging of its conduct from about the
beginning of the year 1792, and the London
Corresponding Society, which was formed,
whether created, I will not say, but which
was modelled by some leading members of
the Constitutional Society, and received its
corporate existence, if I may use the term,
as it will be proved, under their own hand-
writing; most distinctly from the hand-
writing of some, who yet belong, and some,
who have ceased to belong to the Constitu-
tional Society; these leading societies, you
will find, enlisting into their affiliation many
societies in the country, composed of men
who expressed their doubts as to the views of
these societies in London; who expressed
their fears as well as their doubts about those
views; who required information as to the
purposes of those societies in London; some
of these societies in the country professing
one set of principles, some another; but al
assistance is taken that is offered: accordingly
you will see, that the London societies enlist
persons who profess, “ that they ought to
submit to no power but what they have them-
selves immediately constituted:” to these
they give answers, couched in dark, cautious,
prudent, but satisfactory and intelligible
terms: those who profess still to have attach-
ments to the monarchy of the country, and
who express apprehensions about its safety
from the principles of the London societies,
and the conflicting principles of various coun-
try societies, they sooth into fraternization, by
telling them that all would be set right “ by a
full and fair representation of the people in
parliament ;”—a name which was given to the

uy

Commons under Cromwell, as well as to the
legitimate parliaments of this country at dif-
ferent periods,—without telling them either
what these words meant, or how that parlia-
ment was to operate to reconcile these dif-
ferences, which you will find amounted only to
the differences between an attachment to an
absolute republic, and an attachment to a
limited monarchy.

They enlist alike those, who expressed a
wish to know whether they proposed to reform
the House of Commons, and those who wished
to know whether they intend to rip up mo-
narchy by the roots ; their answers were calcu-
lated to satisfy each of them, to satisfy what-
ever might be the disposition of those, who
address the questions to them, eee in-
formation upon subjects so totally different.

Gentlemen, this is not all: you will find
again, that for these purposes,publicationsupon
the government of the country, which are
alluded to in this indictment, and which will
he given to youin evidence, that publications
upon the government of the country were
adopted by those societies as their own, and
circulated, if I may so express myself, ina
mass round the country, circulated in a man-
ner, that totally destroys the liberty of the
press in this country.—The liberty of the press
in this country never vught to be under an
undue correction of the law, but it must
always be, for the sake of the people, subject
to the correction of the law: you will find
that these publications are either brought into
the world with such a secrecy as baffles all
prosecution,—published without names of
authors or of printers,—published by contriv-
ance, I am sorry to say by contrivance pub-
lished in the dead of night (though they are
the works of men who have talents to state
them to open day, if fit to be stated to open
day), and published in quantities, which make
theapplication of the wholesome provisions of
the law utterly incompetent to the purpose of
allowing the correction of the law to beas
frequent as the commission of the offences
against it has been.

Gentlemen, with respect to many of these
pobliations 1 may take notice of what has
happened in the history of this country, and
though no man wishes less to talk of himself
._ than I do, yet I am speaking in the presence
of many, who have heard me both in court
and in parliament respecting those publica-
tions to which I allude (aiid which will be
offered to you in evidence), express the diffi-
culty that my mind laboured under to con-
cede that such a publication as the Address
to the Addressers, was not, according to
law, an overt act of high treason.—It did
appear to me that the fublication of the
book called the Address to the Addres-
sors was an overt act of high treason,
for the purpose of deposing the king; at least
I thought it required an ingenuity and sub-
tlety, much beyond that which belonged to


was not so; but there were reasons satisfac.
tory to those who can judge better than I can
and therefore that book was treated only as a
libel :—but when I come to see it, as con-
nected with the mass of publications alluded
to in this indictment,—as connected with
measures that I have to state to you in the
course of opening this cause,—and as con-
nected with the project which this indictment
imputes to depose the king, I say it is either
most distinct evidence of an overt act of high
peasany or itis an overt act of high treason
itself.

Gentlemen, you will also not fail to observe
(and I state it as a general feature and charae-
ter of the evidence that I have to lay before
you)—the malignant art, and if I may so ex-
press myself, the industrious malignity, with
which discontent has been spread by these
two societies in London, and the means of
spreading it have been studiously and anxiously
taught from society to society:—the means
of spreading sedition, fresh as from London,
in every town, all with reference (for they
are not material, if you do not find they had
such a reference) to the final accomplishment
of the same purpose: you will not fail to ob-
serve how the passions and interests of indivi-
duals have becn assailed, and the method of
assailing them taught, according to their
stations in life—not merely upon government,
—but, for the purpose of subverting govern-
ment, upon tithes—corn-bills—taxes—game-
laws—impress service—any thing that could
be represented as a grievance, as well as the
government itself, and to this intent—that,
in aid and assistance of each other, societies,
as they expressed it, ‘might overspread the
whole face of the island,” and “ that the island
might become free ”—you will mark their ex-
pressions—“ by the same means by which
France became so.”

Gentlemen, in stating to you the character
of the evidence, it is necessary for me to make
one observation, and it is the last I shall trou
ble you with: it is with respect to the prin-
ciples upon which construction is to be given
to the written evidence that will be adduced
in this cause. Now I desire to state this to
your minds as a principle perfectly reasonable
in the administration of justice towards men,
who are called upon to answer for offences
that the language which they use, ought to
be considered according to its obvious sense.
If the language admits, and naturally admits,
of a double interpretation, it must then be
considered according to the nature of the prin-
ciple which that language is calculated to
carry into execution; each paper must be
considered with reference to the context of
the same paper, and with reference to the
contents of all other papers that form the
evidence of the same system, which the paper
produced is meant to prove.

Now, if you shoyld find that, in detailing
the objects of this society, in detailing whet

my mind, to state satisfactory reasons why it | they meant to do, and in detailing how they

meant to execute what they purposed, they
should in fact have stated that they meant
neither that which was legal,—nor that which
‘was constitutional,—nor that which was other
than treason, it will be in vain that they have
thought fit (for the greater prudence, the
greater care, and the greater caution which
you will have most abundant evidence to prove
wey exercised occasionally, but add to the
guilt by increasing the danger) to assert at
other times, when they have used general
language, that what they meant to effect was
legal and that they meant to effect it ina
legal and constitutional manner. It will be-
come them who have the defence upon their
hands, to state to you how, ina legal and con-
stitutional manner those things could be
done, which were intended to be done, and
which this indictment states were intended
to be done, if I prove to your satisfaction that
they were intended to be done by the means
and instruments, which the indictment refers
ado.
Gentlemen of the jury, their principle, as
you will find, was, that equal active citizen-
ship is the right of all men, and that upon
this principle their representation of the peo-
ple wasto be asked for. Now, it requires
no reasoning to state, that a representation of
the people founded upon the principle of equal
active citizenship of all men, must form a par-
liament into which no King, nor Lords, could
enter. There is an end of equal active citizen-
ship the moment that either of them exists,
according to my construction of equal active
citizenship, and according to their construction
of it; for they state that the effect of itis a
representative government. But it is not
enough for me to tell you, that, in reasoning,
this is the consequence; it is a circumstance
to be taken into your consideration ; but I say
I shall satisfy you, if 1am bound to go farther,
that the application of the principle of equal
active citizenship, according to them, was to
be the foundation of a representative govern-
ment, rejecting the King and Lords out of the
system. The principles were the principles
upon which the constitution of France, in the
year 1791, was formed: the principles of that
constitution were the principles of equal ac-
tive citizenship: they attempted indeed to
provers a king in the constitution, and to
form what I may call a royal democracy: but
I shall prove to demonstration, that the
leaders of these clubs in London knew that
that constitution could not exist, that their
principles led them to a distinct knowledge
that that constitution could not exist: it was
in the month of August 1792 entirely over-
turned; and you will find from the transac-
tions of this society in the months of October
and November 1792, unless I mistake the
effect of the evidence, the clearest demonstra-
tion that these societies meant in applying
those principles, which they themselves state
had destroyed the existence of a king in
France, because they must destroy the exist-


ence of a king in any country,—you will find
that,from October 1792 at least, these societies
meant to destroy the king in this country, and
that this was the natural effect of their own
principles, as they understood them.

Gentlemen, you will now give me leave to
state to you, as wellas I can, and as intelli-
gibly as I can, the mass of evidence, and the
case which I have to lay before vou.

The particular act, the nature of which will
be to be explained by all the rest of the evi-
dence, which has led to the including these
particular persons in one indictment, arose
out of a letter, dated the 27th of March 1794,
which was written by the prisoner, then the
secretary of the London Corresponding So-
ciety, to the society for Constitutional Infor-
mation. The words of it are these :

“ I am directed by the London Correspond-
ing Society to transmit the following resolu-
tions to the Society for Constitutional Infor-
mation, and to request the sentiments of that
society respecting the important measures
which the present juncture of affairs seems
to require. The London Corresponding So-
ciety conceives that the moment is arrived” —
mark the words; for, in the rest of what I
have to state, you will frequently hear of the
time to which that allen when a full
and explicit declaration is necessary from all
the friends of freedom, whether the late ille-
gal and unheard of prosecutions and sentences
shall determine us to abandon our cause, or
shall excite us to pursue a radical reform with
an ardour proportionale to the magnitude of
the object, and with a zeal as distinguished on
our part as the treachery of others in the
same glorious cause is notorious. The Society
for Constitutional Information is therefore ree
quired to determine whether or no they will
be ready, when called upon, to act in con-
junction with this and other societies, to ob-
tain a fair representation of the people.” Gen-
tlemen, give me your attention presently to
what they conceive to be a fair representation
of the people, when I come to state the reso-
lutions which they transmit! “ Whether they
concur with us in seeing the necessity of a
speedy Convention for the purpose of obtain-
ing,” (then they use the words), “ in a consti-
tutional and legal method”—of the effect of
which you will judge presently, for the me-
thod will not be the more constitutional and
legal for their calling it so, if the method is in
fact unconstitutional and illegal—“ a redress
of those grievances under which we at present
labour, and which can only be effectually re-
moved by a full and fair representation of the
people of Great Britain. ‘fhe London Cor-
responding Soeiety cannot but remind their
friends that the present crisis demands all the
prudence, .unanimity, and vigour, that ever
may or can be exerted by men or Britons;
nor do they doubt but that manly firmness
and consistency will finally, and they believe
shortly, terminate in the full accomplishment
of all their wishes,”

They then resolve, and these resolutions
are enclosed: “ 1st, That dear as justice and
liberty are to Britons, yet the value of them
is comparatively small without a dependance
on their permanency, and there can be no se-
curity for the continuance of any rights but
in equal laws.

“ 9d, That equal laws can never be expect-
ed but by a full and fair representation of the
people ; to obtain which, in the way pointed
out by the constitution,”—you will see what
that is in the third resolution—“ has been
and is the sole object of this society ; for this
we are ready to hazard every thing, and never
but with our lives will we relinquish an object
which involves the happiness, or even the po-
litical existence of oursclves and posterity.

“ $rd, That it is the decided opinion of this
society, that, to secure ourselves from the fu-
ture illegal and scandalous prosecutions, to
prevent a repetition of wicked and unjust sen-
tences, and to recall those wise and whole-
some laws which have been wrested from us,
and of which scarcely a vestige remains.”—
Gentlemen. you will permit me to call your at-
tention to what the cuiects were which were
to be accomplished—* there ought to.be im-
mediately,”—what?—" a convention of the
peri by delegates deputed for that purpose
oy aks different societies of the friends of free-

.? And what are the purposes which
this convention, which they themselves re-
present as a convention of the people, are to
execute? Why they, the delegates, forming
a convention of the people, are to recall those
wise, wholesome laws, which they say have
been wrested from them. Before I have done,
I shall prove distinctly that this iy the mean-
ing of the passage, and the meaning of the
passage will be to be collected from the whole
of the evidence undoubtedly, not from this
particular part of it.

The Constitutional Society, there being
present at that time six of the persons men-
tioned in this indictment, without any delibe-
ration whatever upon a proposition so mate-
rial as this is—and therefore it must be left
to you, upon the whole of the evidence, whe-
ther it is fairly to be inferred or not, that this,
like a-great many other papers of the London
Corresponding Society, really came from the
Constitutional Society—they immediately or-
dered that their secretary shall acquaint the
London Corresponding Society, that they had
teceived their communication, that they
heartily concur with them in the objects they
have in view, and that for that view, and for
the purpose of a more speedy and effectual
‘co-operation, they invite them to send to this
society, next Friday evening, a delegation of
some of their members.

Without now going into the particulars of
what followed upon this, give me leave to
state, that some members of the society, in-
cluded in this indictment, were named to
compose that delegation; that there was
named at the same time a Committee of Cor-


respondenee of six members of this society;
that afterwards the London Sareronding
Society formed another cemmittee ; t

two committees met; that the two com-
mittees meeting, came to a determination that
this project of calling a convention of the
people should be carried into effect; and
then, that a joint committee of co-operation
of both societies was formed by resolutions
of both.

Having stated what happened upon the
27th of March 1794, and connecting it, as I
shall do presently, with the very singular
facts, which you will find also happened in
that year, you will give me leave, in order to
show what the true construction of this act is,
as well as to state the nds upon which
the indictment, even without this act, charges
@ conspiracy to depose the king—you will
give me leave to state the transactions of these
societies from the month of Mareh 1792.

Gentlemen, in or about the month of March
1792,—whether before that time the Londoa
Corresponding Society had existed oF not,
seems to me to be dubious, and therefore I
will make no assertion of that one way or
other; but supposing it to have existed, it
will be made extremely clear that this suciety
existed at that time without a constitution,
as they call it, and was indebted te a gentle-
man of the name of Tooke for the constitu-
tion under which the society was modified,
and was indebted, I think, to a gentleman of
the name of Waughan, for his assistance in the
composition of the code of its laws.

The first correspondence that I find be-
tween the Constitutional Society, and the
London Corresponding Society, which I have
to state to you, is in the communication of the
principles of the Corresponding Society, sent
with a letter signed by the prisoner at the bar,
which letter is in the following words: “I
am ordered by the committee to send to the
Society for Constitutional Information in Lon-
don a copy of our motives for associating, and
the eeohutions we have come to: we mean
to persevere in the cause we have embarked
in, that is, to have (if possible) an equal repre-
sentation of the people of this nation in pare
liament.”

I observe here for a moment that you will
not be surprised, when I get to the conclusion
of this business, that this cautious language
was used in the outset: it will be for you to
judge whether a studied caution is fairly im-
putable to the language. It proceeds thus:
‘We should be exceedingly happy to enter
into a correspondence with that sdciety, if it
is not too much presumption in us to expect
such an honour; but, as our cause is one, we
hope that they will deign to take some notice
of us, who are now entering upon a matter of
such vast importance.”

This is extremely condescending language
on the part of Mr. Hardy te the Constitu-
tional Society ;‘it accompanies the resolutions
of that society, which resolutions purported to

be signed “ Thomas Hardy, secretary.” It
happened, by an accident not very easy to be
accounted for at present, and, notwithstand-
ing which, I shall prove distinctly to you that
the resolutions are the act of Mr. Hardy: thet
this signature—* Thomas Handy, secretary” —
ie a signature, as I am instructed, in the
hand-writing of Mr. Horne Tooke; that is,
Mr. Hardy in the London Corresponding So-
ciety, sends the resolutions of the London
Corresponding Society (apologizing extremely
for the liberty he takes in presuming to send
them) to the Constitutional Society, the sig-
Nature to those resolutions bearing the name
of Thomas Hardy in the hand-writing of Mr.
Tooke: whether those resolutions were finally
settled by that gentleman or not, I do not
knew ; but you will find that there exists a
paper which contains, I think, distinct evi-
dence upon the face of it, that those resolu-
tions have been settled, with a deal of
deliberation, by the same gentleman whose
hand-writing occurs in the signature which I
have been stating.

Gentlemen, before these resolutions were
sent, and before I state the matter of them to

you, you will allow me to mention that there

ad been a correspondence between other sv-
cieties, and the Society for Constitutional In-
formation, of such a nature, as, in order to
make this case intelligible, will require some
observations from me, and some attention
from you; itis the correspondence of other
societies, but which correspondence I shall
connect in such a manner with the London
Corresponding Society, as in fact to make the
acts of the other societies the acts of that so-
ciety.

Upon the 23rd of March 1792, with a view
to show you what were the principles of this
Constitutional Society, I must state, that they
come to a resolution, “That the thanks of
this society be given to Mr. Thomas Paine,
for his most masterly book intituled, The
Rights of Man, in which not only the male-
volent soplistries of hireling scribblers are de-
tected, and exposed to merited ridicule, but
many of the most important and beneficial
political truths are stated so irresistibly con-
vincing as to promise the acceleration of that
not very distant period, when usurping bo-
rough-sellers and protligate borough-buyers
shall be deprived of what they impudently
dare to call their Propertyethe choice of the
representatives of the people. The Constitu-
tional Socicty cannot help expressing their sa-
tisfaction that so valuable a publication has
Proceeded trom a member of that society, and
they sincerely hope, that the people of Eng-
land val give that attention to the subjects.
discussed in Mr. Paine’s treatise, which their
manitest importance so justly deserves.”

Then they resolved, for what purpose you
will judge of, when I come to state to you the
subsequent evidence in this business—“ That
the foregoing resolutions, and all future pro-
ceedings of this society, be regularly transmit-


ted by the secretary to all our corresponding
constitutional societies in England, Seotland,
and France.”

Now, gentlemen, as I shall prove what the
book was to which this resohition alluded, I
shall take the liberty at present to state in a
few words to you, as far as they affect the ex-
istenee of a king in this country, those sub-
jects, which, according to the language of this
resolution, the Constitutional Society sincerely
hope that the people of land would give
attention to, as discussed in Mr. Paine’s first
book. In that book these doctrines, with re-
spect to Great Britain, are laid down: “a
constitution is not a thing in name only, but
in fact; it has not an ideal, but a real exist-
ence ;” and you will find this extremely im-

t, because in the result of the whole
evidence that I have to lay before you, it will
appear that they did not only distinctly dis-
avow making any application to parliament,
but the competence of parliament to de any
thing by way of reform, because the country
had as yet no constitution formed by the peo-
ple. Mr. Paine proceeds: “Can Mr. Burke
produce the English constitution? If he can-
not, we may fairly conclude that no such
thing as a constitution exists.”

After stating that the septennial bill show-
ed that there was no such thing as a consti-
tution in England, the book states a farther
fact, not immaterial, that the bill which Mr,
Pitt brought into parliament some years ago
to reform parliament, was upon the same er-
Toneous principle, that is, upon the principle
that patliataene was able to reform itself.
With respect to other subjects, to which the
attention of the people of England wascalled,
you will find that this book, speaking of
modes of government (and this is also ex-
tremely material with reference to the con-
struction of what is afterwards to be stated to
you), represents that “the two modes of go-
vernment which prevail in the world are, frst,
governments by election and representation ;
secondly, governments by hereditary succes-
sion: the former is generally known by the
name of republican, the latter by that of mo-
narchy and aristocracy.”

He divides government into government by
election and representation ;—a representation
founded upon election, and election founded
upon universal suffrage ;—and government by
hereditary succession. He then states that,
from the revolutions of America and France,
and the symptoms that have appeared in
other countries, it is evident the opinion of
the world is changing with respect to govern-
ment, and that revolutions are not within the
progress of political calculation; and that the
British government, not existing upon the
principles he recommends, is not a govern-
ment existing upon such principles that a na-
tion ought to submit to-it; and that the
liament of the country is not able to form a
government, that will exist upon those pripci-
ples.

Gentlemen, it is a very remarkable cir-
cumstance, as it strikes me, that, though va-
rious societies had existed in other parts of
Great Britain, till about the time of the for-
mation of the London Corresponding Society,
none of these societies had asked or invited af-
filiation with the London Constitutional Socie-
ty, which you will find they all ask and all in-
vite about March 1792, whether by manage-
ment or not, I do not pretend to determine, it
will be for you to judge; but they all ask and
all invite affiliation with the Constitutional
and Corresponding Societies, as soon as the
latter is formed.

Upon the 16th of March 1792, you will
find a resolution of the society for Constitu-
tional Information, which states and returns
thanks fora communication from Manches-
ter, signed “ Thomas Walker,* president,”
and “Samuel Jackson, secretary ;” in which
they return the thanks of the society to Mr.
Fhomas Paine,” who appears to have been
a@ member, a visitor of this Constitutional So-
ciety, “ for the publication of his Second Part
of the Rights of Man, combining Principle
and Practice.” I shall endeavour to state to
you in a few words what is the combination
of the practice stated in the Second Part of
the Rights of Man, with the Lib in the
First Part, “a work,” they say, “ of the high-
est importance to every nation under heaven,
but particularly this, as containing excellent
and practicable plans for an immediate and
considerable reduction of the public expendi-

* gure for the prevention of wars, for the ex-

tension of our manufactures and commerce,
for the education of the young, for the com-
fortable support of the aged, for the better
maintenance of the poor of every description,
and, finally, for lessening, greatly, and with-
out delay, the enormous load of taxes, under
which this country at present labours.

“ That this society congratulate their coun-
try at large on the influence which Mr. Paine's
publications appear to have had in procuring
the repeal of some oppressive taxes in the
present session of parliament ; and they hope
that this adoption of a small part of Mr.
Paine’s ideas will be followed by the most
strenuous exertions to accomplish a complete
reform in the present inadequate state of the
representation of the people, and that the
other pest plans of public benefit, which Mr.
Paine has so powerfully recommended, will
be speedily carried into effect.”

ow, gentlemen, as Mr. Paine’s plan for
the remedy of the present inadequate state of
the representation of the people was alluded
to, and this book was alloted to, which com-
bined “ principle” and “ practice,” and as it
is stated that the other great plans of public
benefit, which he had so powerfully recom-
mended, would be speedily carried into effect,
it will be necessary to show you, from this
letter, what were those plans for the remedy
—


of the inadequate state of the representation
of the people, and other plans of public bene-

fit, which this society, recciving the thanks of
the Constitutional Society, hoped would be
carried into effect.

Gentlemen, I do not take up your time in
stating the passages to you, but represent to
you the substance of that book; that itis a

k distinctly and means recommending the
deposition of the king : if the passages in that
book do not prove that assertion, there is no
evidence that can prove any assertion : it is a
book, moreover, which not only puts the king
out of the system of the government of the
country, but, according to which, if'a perfect
representation of the people is to be formed,
it 1s to be formed not by a parliament existing
in a country—in which that gentleman states
that no constitution exists—not by that par-
liament, which he states to be totally aud a
solutely inadequate to the great work of form-
ing the constitution upon the nights of man
and equal active citizenship, which he recom-
mends: it is a work, which calls upon the peo-
ple of England to do themselves justice in
another way of proceeding, and to form a
constitution for themselves before they can
have any government, which is to exist upon
true principles. There is then, I say, in the
beginning of this thing, a developement of
these purposes; and I say, beyond that, that
if I understand the effect of evidence at all,
I shall satisfy you that those, who voted this
resolution of thanks, knew that the principles
there referred to, were principles that would
have this operation, and meant that they
should have this effect.

The next thing I have to state, which I
shall not go through very particularly, is con-
tained in a resolution of the Constitutional
Society (some of the members of which, I
shall prove to you, began to leave the society
about this time, stating distinctly that they
understood its principles to be now different
from the principles it had formerly acted
upon, and to be such principles as I have
stated) entered into upon the 23rd of March
1792. They resolved that another communi-
cation, which is from Sheffield, should be
published in the Morning Chronicle, and in
several other newspapers, which they, men-
tion.

With respect to the communication from
Sheffield (and it is a remarkable thing that,
from Shefteld, and from Norwich, they should
be writing, on the same day, for the same

urpose—that the societies of Sheffield and
Nomick might be affiliated with the London
Constitutional Society, and the Sheffield peo
ple were so anxious about it, if it were their
own act and deed, that they wrote more than
ope letter in order to ask it), it is to this ef
ect:

“ Itis now about four months since this so-
ciety first formed itself into a regular body 5
they were then but very few in number; the
encleeed will inform you of their increase,


and, which is most probable, will soon be-
come very numerous ; and not only this large
and populous tewn, but the whole neighbour-

for many miles round about, have an at-
tentive eve upon us: most of the towns and
villages indeed are forming themselves into
similar associations, and strictly adhere to the
mode of copying after us: you will easily con-
ceive the necessity for the leading members
of this body to pay strict attention to good or-
der and regularity, and the need we have of
consulting and communicating with those
who are sincere friends and able advocates
for the same cause ; for these reasons we took
the liberty to write to Mr. Horne Tooke, that
worthy friend and patriot for the rights of the
people, informing him of our earnest desire of
entering into connexion with the society of
the same denomination of ours in London;
his very obliging and affectionate answer fa-
vours us with your address; in consequence,
we have taken the liberty herewith to trans-
mit to yu some resolves, which were passed
at our last meetings by the whole body, and
the committee was charged with the dispatch
of panne and forwarding them to you ac-
cordingly, for the purpose of submitting them
to the consideration of your society, and to
make use of them as they think most prudent.
You will also notice the Belpar address: they
applied to us about two months ago for in-
structions as to our mode of conducting, &c.
had not then formed themselves into any re-
gular association. Belpar is nearly thirty
miles from this place, in Derbyshire, and
eight or.ten miles from Derby.

“ If the society for Constitutional Informa-
tion in London should vouchsafe so far to
notice us, as to enter into a connexion and
correspondence with us, it cannot fail of pro-
Moting honour, and adding strength to our
feeble endeavours, and to the common cause,
which is the entire motive we have in view.”

They then, upon the 14th of March, 1792,
knowing that there was a connexion between
the London Constitutional and London Cor-
responding Society (and that they should
know that fact on the 14th of March, which
is sixteen days before the Soth, when Mr,
Hardy sent to Mr. Tooke the resolutions
which were signed in the name of Mr. Hardy
by Mr. Tooke, as a communication to him
that there was such a body as the London
Corresponding Society, is a circumstance that
‘affords observation); they then add, “ We
have taken the liberty of enclosing a parcel
for Mr. Hardy, in answer to a letter from him
to this society, requesting some information
concerning our method of conducting the
business we had embarked in, &c. also in-
forming us there are in London a number of
mechanics, shopkeepers, &c. forming them-
selves into a society on the broad basis of the
rights of man. You will be so obliging as to
let the packet remain with you until he call
for it, as by this post I have wrote him
thereof. We have given him our manner of


proceeding from our setting out to this time,
and hope it may be of some use. The im-
provement we are about to adopt is certainly.
the best for managing large bodies, as in
great and populous towns, viz. dividing them
Into small bodies or meetings of ten persons
each, and these ten to appoint a delegate;
ten of these delegates form another meeting
and so on, delegating from one to another,
till at last they are reduced to a proper num-
ber for constituting the committee or grand
council.”

There is another letter of the same date,
which has a remarkable circumstance about
it. It is addressed to the Constitutional So-
ciety. Gentlemen, it states that “ this soe
ciety,” that is, the same Sheffield Society,
“ feeling, as they do, the grievous effects of the
present state defects and abuse of our country,”
—(the word originally in this letter was cone
stitution, but the word constitution, not bein,
that which was liked, by some very odd acci-
dent in the letter from Sheffield, the word
country, in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke, is
substituted for constitution )—* the great and
heavy oppressions, which the common people
labour under, as the natural consequence of
that corruption, and at the time being sen-
sible to a degree of certainty, that the public
minds and the general sentiments of the
ple are determined to obtain a radical reform
of the country,” you will mark these roe
“ as soon ag prudence and discretion wil.
permit, believes it their duty to make use of
every prudent means, as far as their abilities
can be extended, to obtain so salutary and
desirable an object, as a thorough reformation
of our country,” the word country being again
in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke, “ estas
blished upon that system, which is consistent
with the rights of man,’—for these reasons
they state their forming into clubs, as the
former letter did, and they conclude thus—
“ that being thus strengthened, this rromck 4
may be better enabled to govern itself wit!
more propriety, and to render assistance to
their fellow-citizens in this neighbourhood,
and in parts more remote, that they in their
turn may extend useful knowledge still far-
ther from town to village, and from village to
town, until the whole nation be sufficiently
enlightened and united in the same cause,
which cannot fail of being the case, wherever
the most excellent works of Mr. Thomas
Paine find residence.” .

Those works are the works which hava
held an hereditary monarchy, however li-
mited, to be inconsistent with the rights of
man; which have held the constitution of
parliament in this country to be inconsistent
with the rights of man; and those works,
upon the principles of that inconsistency,
have held even the parliament itself incom-
petent to reform any abuses in government.

The paper they transmit states as a fact,
that the number of members at Shefficld
were, in March 1792, two thousand. -That

the Constitutional Society in London and the
Constitutional Society at Sheffield, thus nu-
merous, should have had no connexion by
affiliation till the 14th of March, 1792,
though, on that 14th of March, 1792, it ap-
pears that the Sheffield Society had had cor-
respondence, and had become connected with
the London Corresponding Society, prior to
the London Corresponding Sucicty sendin
the paper I before stated to the Constitutional
Society, is somewhat remarkable. _ ;
The paper proceeds thus: “ This society,
om are chiefly of the manufacturers of

s 1d, began about four months ago, and
is already increased to nearly two thousand
members.” In this letter, dated March 14,
1792, they state it to have amounted to two
thousand, exclusive of neighhouring towns
and villages, who were forming themselves
into similar societies. They then state the prin-
ciples upon which the societies are formed,
and that “ they have derived more true
knowledge from the two works of Mr. The-
mas Paine, intituled Rights of Man, Part the
First and Second, than from any other author
on the subject. The tice as well as the
principle of government is laid down in those
works, in a mannet so clear and irresistibly
convincing, that this society do hereby resolve
to give their thanks to Mr. Paine for his two
said publications intituled Rights of Man.”
Gentlemen, I beg your pardon for address-
ing you so much at length on this case, but
I feel it my bounden duty to the public, to
you, and to the prisoner at the bar, to warn
you fully of the whole of it. There is nothing
which, I am sure, would more certainly hap-
pen, than that I should go, not only out of
this court, but to my grave, with pain, if I
should have stated to you in a proceeding of
this nature the doctrines of Mr. Paine, other-
wise than as I think of them. If that is
meant to be intimated, that we may have no
dispute about them, and that we may not
misunderstand what is that principle, and
that practice, to which the passage I have
now read alludes, you will allow me to read
a few passages out of this second part of the
Rights of Man, said to contain both the prin-
cipleiand practice of government, and then I
ask you what those must have intended,
with respect to the government of this coun-
try, who meant to take any step in order to
make a change in it, in such a way as the
principle and practice laid down in that book
would require them to make it, recollecting
that the government of this country is a go-
vernment consisting in a king, having an he-
reditary crown, together with Lords and
Commons, forming a parliament according
to the laws and constitution of England.
Now, that author, in the first place, ex-
presses a great deal of what possibly may be
differently thought of by other persons, but
what I cannot call good-will to the people of
England—for he says, “ that during the time
of the American war, he was strongly im-


pressed with the idea, that if he could cet
over to England without being known, and
only remain in safety till he could out 8
publication, that he could open the eyes of
the country with respect to the madness and
stupidity of its government.”

Let us see in what that madness consisted
according to him: having stated in his for-
mer book that a government ought to exist
in no country, but according to the principles
of the rights of man—he re again the
distinction he had stated in his former book,
between what he calls the two systems: he
says, ‘“ that the one now called the okd is he-
reditary, either in whole or in part,” which is
that of England; and the new is entirely
repregentative,”—that is,.a government con-
sisting of a Commons House, if you choose
so to call it.—We know, that in 1649 the
ruling government in this country was called
a parliament, called a Commons Huuse, and
it was then enacted, that if any persons should
attempt to put a king into this country, they
boul be deemed traitors, with much less of
an overt act manifested than is necessary st
this day. Again, it is stated, “ an heritable
crown, or an heritable throne, or by what
ever fanciful name such things may be called,
have no other significant explanation than
that mankind are heritable property. To in-
herit a government, is to inherit the people,
as if they were flocks and herds.” *

“ Hereditary successionis a burlesque upon
monarchy. It puts it in the most ndiculous
light by presenting it as an office, which any
child or idiot may fill. It requires some
talents to be a olan Lise i to be
a king requires only the animal figure of
man, i ant of ireatlinns autumaton. This
sort of superstition may last a few years
more, but it cannot long resist the awakenéd
reason and interest of man ;” then, “ in what-
ever manner the separate parts of a constitu-
tion may be arranged, there is one general
principle, that distinguishes freedom from
slavery, which is, that all hereditary govern-
ment over a people is to them a species of
slavery, and representative government is
freedom ;” then, speaking of the crown of
England, that crown, in which, according to
the law and constitution of this country, ae-
cording to its principle and practice, is vested
the sovereignty in the manner in which I
have stated it, he says, “ having thus glanced
at some of the defects of the two Houses of
Parliament, I procced to what is called the
crown, upon which I shall be very concise.

“It signifies a nominal office of a million
sterling a year.”—Again, gentlemen, give me
leave to observe that this, which has been so
often detailed for the worst of purposes, can-
hot but be known to those who know any
thing of the constitution of the country—I
charge nobody else—those who know any
thing of the constitution—I charge not those
who do not know it)—to be in substance a
gross misrepresentation—“ the business of

which consists in receiving the money.
‘Whether the person be wise or foolish, sane
or insane, a native or a foreigner, matters not.
Every minister acts upon the same idea that
Mr. Burke writes, namely, that the people
must be hoodwinked, and held in superstitious
ignorance by some bugbear or other; and
what is called the crown answers this purpose,
and therefore it answers all the purposes to
be expected from it.”

Gentlemen, in another part of this work,
you will find that Mr. Paine was very well
aware of what these Sheftield correspondents
were aware of, if they were the composers of
the letter to which I have alluded; that the

rinciples, laid down in the constitution of |
rance, which these two books were to re- |
commend, and the principles, stated in:
-Paioe’s first book, were absolutely inconsistent '
with the constitution itself of France, as it
existed at that moment; and Paine propheti- |
cally (he would not have had common sense
if he had stated it otherwise), even in the |
beginning of 1792, when he publishes this ;
book, foretells that the government of France, '
with a king a part of it, upon his principles, ;
and the ‘principles professed by the constitu-
tion of France, could not exist: he foresaw |
shat in August 1792; and I will prove, that
persons, who were thus approving the
rinciples and practice of Paine,

new that a
ing could not exist consistently with those ;
principles ; and they adopted them therefore, ;
as we insist, in order that a king should not
-exist in this country.

Gentlemen, these resolutions being re-
ceived perhaps from Sheffield, a step is taken
upon them in the Constitutional Society, and
.& step, which gives an authenticity to the.
book I have in my hand, namely, the book of ;
their proceedings, whichis remarkable enough;

for in this society’s book there are these reso-
futions, which are supposed to be received
. from Sheffield, watered to the book ; and then
with a view of 2 publication of them, in the
ong Chronicle, World, Post, Times,
: Argus, English Chronicle, and General Even-
ing Post, for the purpose of cireulating the
principles of Mr. Thomas Paine, and for the
purpose of circulating the representation,
which is made in these resolutions, there is
first of all, in Mr. Tooke’s hand-writing,—
“ Society for Constitutional Information, Lon-
don, March 23rd, 1792. This Society having
weceived the following and other communica-
tions from Sheffield, vi2.”—his hand-writing—
then,“ March 14th, 1792,”—his hand-writing
then the words “two thousand members,”
scored under, I cannot say by him, but by
somebody, I suppose for the purpose of being
printed in italics; and there is at the conclu-
sion of this minute in the hand-writing of
Mr. Tooke,
« That the seeretary do return the thanks of
. this Society to the Society for Constitutional
Information established at Sheffield, and that
he express to them with what friendship and


affection this society embraces them, as brothers
aud Jellow-tabeteress in the same cause ;”—of
principle and practice I suppose. “ That he do
assure them of our entire concurrence with
their opinion, viz. that the people of this country
are not, as Mr. Burke terms them, swine ;”—-
the writer of this must have known very well
the sense in which an improper word, I
readily admit, was used by the person to
whom he now alludes,—but rational beings,
better qualified to separate truth from error
than himself, possessing more honesty, and less
craft.

“ Resolved, that this society will on Friday
next, March 31st, ballot for the twelve as-
sociated members recommended by the Sheffield
committee, and approved at this meeting.”—
Then this paper 1s thus ordered to be pub-
lished for the primary purpose, I submit, of
recommending that principle {and practice,
which makes the Sheffield people “ tellow-
labourers” with the Constitutional Society in
the same cause of principle and practice, and
which, both in the principle and practice, was
aimed at the destruction of the government of
the country ;—of that hereditary monarchy,
which Paine represents as tyranny ;—of
limited monarchy, which he represents as
tyranny ; and for the purpose of recommend-
ing that representative government, which, I
say, is the true sense of all the words which
these people use:—but this is not all—you
will observe, that this paper of resolutions
was accompanied by a letter, in which letter
there is also the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke,
and that the paper states that two thousan
members belong to the society at Sheflield,
and that this number is to be stated by pub-
lication, as the number of persons belonging
to the society at Sheffield. In another publi-
cation they are stated to amount to two :
thousand four hundred—in November 1793,
it is stated, that they were many thousands :
now you will see from the witnesses, some of
these correspondents, these able men, who
are so little corrupt, in the course of examina-
tion—you will see, unless I am mistaken in
the effect of the evidence I have to offer, the
truth of an observation that I made, that
mankind were to be misled, and societies
were to be invited to be created, by the mis-
representation of numbers, and by giving to
existing societies a colour in that respect,
which did not belong to them; for to this
hour, after all the pains which have been
taken with the Sheffield people (and what
pains you will hear), those persons, who
were two thousand, have yet arrived to but
about six hundred. . ;

Gentiemen, this society, having in this
letter expressed an inclination that they
should have some associated members in the
Constitutional Society, that affiliation begins
in the Constitutional Socicty in London,
which I have alluded to; and accordingly you
will find, that upon the 31st of March, twelve
persons were ballotted for as from the Shef-

U

a

field Society, and became associated members
of this society; you observe, that this letter
had stated from Sheffield that they had
received before a communication from Mr.
Tooke, and Mr. Tooke afterwards writes a
draught of a letter which is sent to them, in
which he states, “I am directed by the
Society for Constitutional Information to
acknowledge the receipt of your letter, and to
express to you that very great pleasure and
satistaction which they received from your
communication; the society have unani-
mously elected twelve” (here follow the
names of the persons), “ as associated msm-
bers of this society.’—These persons being
certainly, gentlemen, extremely respectable
men as subjects of Great Britain, but at the
Same time men, that one wonders a little
should, upon such a purpose as this, without
a little more instruction being infused into
their minds, have been associated as members
into this society—“ and we flatter ourselves,
that when any business or other occasion
shall lead any of those gentlemen to London,
they will be kind enough to honour the
society by their presence, and give us an
opportunity of cementing that friendship
between us, which all the zealous friends of
public freedom and the happiness of mankind
ought to feel and exercise towards each other.

“P.S. I am desired, by Mr. Horne Tooke,
to request each of the associated members to
honour him by the acceptance of the books
which accompany this letter ;”—which were,
I apprehend it appears, so many parts of the
Rights of Man.

Gentlemen, upon the 24th of March 1792,
@ paper apeears to have been sent to the
Constitutional Society from a nest of societies,
the United Constitutional Societies at Nor-
wich: this was the 24th of March 1792, and
it appears, as I am instructed, that the words
“24th March 1792,” are also in the hand-
writing of Mr. Tooke.

“At a meeting of the delegates of the
United Constitutional Societies, held the 24th
March 1799, at the Wheel-of Fortune, St.
Edmund's in the city of Norwich, it was
unanimously agreed to communicate to the
gentlemen of the London Society for Consti-
Pa Information, the following Resolu-

ions:

“ 1st. We are happy to see the success of
the Sheffield Society for Constitutional Re-
form, and approve of the delegations, which
you and they have made in order to form a
plan of general information. We humbly

eg that you would grant to us the same
favour ; and it is our wish, that all the
Societies of a similar kind in England were
only as so many members strongly and indis-
solubly united in one political body.

“edly. We believe that instructing the
people in political knowledge, and in their

only effectual way to oblain the grand object
of reform, for men need only be made ac-
quainted with the abuses of government, and

‘ ’ '
natural and inherent rights as men, is the |


they will readily jom in every lawfat means to
obtain redress; we havethe pleasure to inform
you that our societies consist of some hun
dreds, and new societies are frequently form-
ing, which, by delegates, preserve a mutual
intercourse with each other, for mutual in-
struction and information; and the greatest
care has been taken to preserve order and
regularity at our meetings, to convince the
world that riot and disorder are no parts of
our political creed.

“ 8dly. We believe, and are firmly oe
suaded” (and if any man thought so, he had
a right to say so if he pleased), “that Mr.
Burke, the once friend of liberty, has traduced
the greatest and most glorious revolution ever
recorded in the annals of history; we thank
Mr. Burke for the political discussion provoked
and by which he has opened unto us the dawn
of a glorious day.

“ 4thly. To Mr. Thomas Paine our thanks
are especially due for the First and Second
parts of the Rights of Man, and we sincerely
wish that he may live to see his labours”—
that is, the destruction of hereditary govern-
ment and limited monarchy, and consequeath
the government of England—* crowned wi
success in the general diffusion of liberty and
happiness among mankind.”

Gentlemen this letter does not appear
(though the words, the 24th of Mareh, are in
the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke) to have been
read in the Constitutional Society till the 14th
of May 1792, when they read this letter, and
also another, which I will now state to you,
from the society called the Norwich Revolu-
tion Seciety.

“ The Norwich Revolution Society wishes
to opena communication with you atthis time,
when corruption has acquired a publicity in
the senate, which exacts from the honour
the British nation renewed exertions for par-
liament reform—without prejudging the
probable event”—(this is a material passage.
when you connect it with what is found in
other subsequent papers) —* even of such an
application to the legislature, the soeicly is
willing to circulate the information, and to
co-operate in the measures, that may seem
best adapted to further so desirable and so
important an end; it is willing to hope the
redress of every existing grievance at the
hands of a government resulting from an ex-
traordinary convocation in 1688—an extraor-
dinary convention of all, who had at any pre-
ceding time been elected representatives of
the people, assisted by the hereditary coun-
sellors of the nation, and a peculiar deputa-
tion from the metropolis; which - national
constituting assembly cashiered for miiscon-
duct a king of the house vf Stuart.” —

The opinions und principles of this society
are best explained by an appeal to their lite-
rary representative— To James Mackintosh,®




author of the Vindiclz Gallice, the society
affers the tribute of its approbation-and gra-
titude for the knowledge, the eloquence, and
the philosophical spirit, with which he has
explained, defended, and commented on the
revolution of France; it hesitates to assent
to this only of his opinions—that there are
but two interests in society, those of the rich
and those of the poor—if so, what chance
have the latter? Surely the interests of all
the industrious, from the richest merchant to
the poorest mechanic, are, in every community
the same, to lessen the numbers of the unpro-
ductive, to whose maintenance they contri-
bute, and to do away such institutions and im-
as abridge the means of maintenance,

y resisting the demand for labour, or by
sharing in reward : as the means most condu-
cive to this comprehensive end, the Norwich
Revolution Society desires an equitable repre-
sentation of the people.

“ The Rights of Man by Thomas Paine,
and the advice to the privileged orders by Joel
Barlow,” a book which I shall give in evi-
dence, and therefore shall state some passages
from presently, “have also been read with

attention and circulated with avidity.”—Now,

Barlow’s book you will find is, in the plainest
and most unequivocal language, as I under-
stand it, an exhortation to all people to get
rid of kingly government, and addressed more
Particularly to the two societies I have men-
tioned, as containing the substance of the bu-
Siness, in which they are interested, as you
will see when {I come to state the transactions
of October 1792.

“The Rights of Man by Thomas Paine,
and the advice to the privileged orders by Joel
Barlow, have also been read with attention
and circulated with avidity; they point out
with clearness most of the abuses which have
accumulated under the British government ;
they attack with energy most of the prejudi-
ces which have tended to perpetuate them.”

Now, how any man living could thank
these People without informing them that, if
they really meant well to their country, they
must be ignorant in the extreme, or something
worse, if they could reconcile cither the
Rights of Man or Joel Barlow’s book on the
Privileged Orders with the principles of that
convention in 1688, which is the foundation
of the liberties of this country, is to me quite
inexplicable. But, after stating the consti-
tution of this country, in a letter fabricated
with great art, there follow the twelve names
of the intended associated members from Nor-
wich; and the description of some of these
twelve happens also, from a singular circum-
stance, to be in the hand-writing of Mr.
Tooke. Then this society returns thanks to

the societies at Sheffield and Norwich for
these communications.

_ The resolutions of the London Correspond-
ing Society, which I told you were sent on the
30th of March, are to this effect :

‘* Resolved, That every individual has aright

~


to share in the government of that society of
which he is a member, unless incapacitated.

“ Resolved, That nothing but non-age, or
privation of reason, or an offence against the
general rules of society, can incapacitate him.

“ Resolved, That it is not less the right,
than the duty of every citizen, to keep a
watchful eye on the government of this coun-
try, that the laws, by being multiplied, do not
degenerate into oppression, and that those who
are intrusted with the government do not sub-
stitute private interest for public advantuge.

“ Resolved, That the people of Great Lri-
tain are not properly represented in pariia-
ment,

“ Resolved, That in consequence of a par-
tial, unequal, and inadequate representation,
together with the corrupt method in which
representatives are elected, oppressive taxes,
unjust laws, restrictions of liberty, and wast-
ing of the public money, have ensued.

“ Resolved, That the only remedy to those
evils is, a fair and impartial representation of
the people in parliament.

“ Resolved, That a fair and impartial repre-
sentation can never take place until partial
privileges are abolished, and the strong temp-
tations held out to electors afford a presump-
tive proof, that the representatives of this
country seldom procure a seat in parliament
from the unbought suffrages ofa free people.

« Resolved, That this society do express
their abhorrence of tumult and violence :
and that, as they aim at reform not anarchy,
reason, firmness, and unanimity be the only
arms they employ, or persuade their fellow-
citizens to exert against abuse of power.”

Gentlemen, in this, which I have now read
to you, I am willing, if you please, that you
should construe every word of it, though cer-
tainly it is pot consistent with the principles
of British government, upon this principle,
that those, who sent that paper to the Consti-
tutional Society, if it even was sent there at
all, really understood it to be consistent with
the principles of the British government; and
I claim no credit for the veracity with which
Lassert, that this conspiracy has existed, un-
less I show you by subsequent acts of this so-
ciety, that at this moment they meant what
Mr. Paine says, in principle and practice, is
the only rational thing—a representative go-
vernment ; the direct contrary of the govern-
ment which is established here.

You will find, by what I shall lay before
you, that there was a society in Southwark.
—To this society the London Corresponding
Society, in a letter which I have to read to you
presently, stated their adoption of all Mr.
Paine’s principles, with a view, as I think, to
the practice recommended in his works: this
society also received the thanks of the Consti-
tutional Society fora communication which I
am about to state to you; and the London
Corresponding Society afterwards entered, as
it seems to me, into-a combination with them,
upon the principles stated in that communi-

cation: I say it is impossible, attending to | Constitutional Society—* and with the Soci-
these facts, for any man who reasons fairly, | ety for Constitutional Information in London,
to doubt that the principle of the London ! as the best means of cementing the common

Corresponding Suciety and of the Constitutio- |
nal Society was, to furm a representatice go- ;
vernment, in this country.

A declaration from a society in Southwark |
was read:— Resolved, that the thanks of |
this society be given to the Southwark society |
for the following communication, and that it '
be published in the newspapers :

“ April 19, 1792, at the Three Tuns tavern, |
Southwark — Resolved, That we do now form .
ourselves into a society for the diffusion of |
political knowledge. ;

* Resulved, That the society be denomi- '
nated the Friends of the People.

“ Resolved, That the following be the de-
claration of this suciety,”"—which is the pre-
amble to the constitution in France, in the
year 171

“ Considering that ignorance, forgetfulness, |
or conten:pt of the rights of men, are the sole
causes of public grievances, and the corruption
of government, this society, formed for the
purpose of investigating and asserting those |
rights, and of uniting our efforts with others :
of our fellow-citizens for correcting national
abuses, and restraining unnecessary and ex-
orbitant taxation, do hereby declare—

_ “First, That the great end of civil society
is general happiness.

Secondly, fhat no form of government is
good, any farther than it secures that object.

“ Thirdly, That all civiland political autho- |
rity is derived from the pecple”—that people,
of whom they were afterwards to form a con-
vention.

“ Fourthly, That equal active citizenship is
the unalienable right of all men; minors, cri-
minals, and insane persons excepted.”

Now will my friend dispute with me what

these principles, according to the ideas of those
who state them, lead to?
_ “ Fifthly, That the exercise of that right,
in appointing an adequate representative go-
vernment,”—that is, the government, which
Mr. Paine tells you, rejects every thing that
is hereditary—is what;—“ the wisest device
of human policy”—not only that, but it is—
“ the only security of national freedom.”—
Then, is not that a direct assertion, that the
British government exists upon principles not
reconcilable with the principles of a govern-
ment that can have any security, or such a
security as it ought to have for general tree-
dom?

The Sone for Constitutional Information
return their thanks upon that also, and then
those persons who write this letter say far-
ther in the same paper—

“We call upon our fellow-citizens, of all
- descriptions, to institute societies for the same
great purpose”—that is the purpose of intro-
ducing representative government— and we
recommend a general correspondence with
each other”—but attached and rivetted to the

union, and of directing with greater ener,
our united efforts to the same common ol
jects.” ;

What were the objects of this society ? You
will find that the objects of this society were
the objects of the Constitutional Society ;
and you will find presently that they were
the objects of the Corresponding Society :—
The Constitutional Society resolved, *¢ that
every society, desiring an union, or correspon-
dence with this, and which doth not profess
any principles destructive to truth or justice”
—how this gives occasion for the first remark
T have to make upon language—“ or subver-
sive to the liberties of our country: but which,
on the contrary, secks, as we do, the removal
of corruption from the legislature and abuses
from the government, ought to be, and we
hope will be embraced with the most bro-
therly affection and patriotic friendship by this
society.”

1 observe upon this, that all this handsome
language is perfectly consistent with this
principle, in the minds of those who write it,
and they do not venture to explain it, because

| I think they durst not explain it,—with this

idea in their minds, that those principles
were destructive of truth aud justice were
subversive to the liberties of the country,
which were principles in opposition to those
of Mr. Paine; and that all practice, that was
in opposition to the practice he recommends,
was subversive to the liberties of the country.

I come now to a circumstance or two,
which lead me to state shortly what will be
proved to be the original constitution of the
London Corresponding Seciety—the plan (the
efficacy of which had been tried in France,
and which men, who came from that country,
were probably well acquainted with)—was, to
unite, first small bodies of men—as svon as
they came to a greater number, to divide
them into smaller parties, and so to spread
themselves by degrees (as you will find in the
letters, was the purpose of these societies),
from town to town, from village to village,
from hamlet to hamlet, till, as they explain
it, there should not be an unenlightened man
in the country.

The constitution of the London Corres~
ponding Society was formed upon this prin~
ciple ; it will appear from the written evidence
which will be produced to you, that a gentle.
man of the name, I think of Felix Vaughan,
was appointed a delegate upon the 30th of
April, for No. 63; that Mr Hardy cousulted
him; and, being also appointed to form a
constitutional code of Jaws for the Londom
Corresponding Society, Mr. Hardy consulted
him upon that subject. The preamble te the
resolutions which formed their constitution
was this: “ Whereas it is notorious that very
numerous butthensomeand unnecessary taxes
are laid on the persons and families of us and

others the industrious inhabitants of Great | for No. 68; Mr: Richter, a pai

Britain, an exeeedingly great majority of whom
are, notwithstanding, excluded from all repre-
sentation in parliament; and as apon inquiry
into the cause of this grievance, which 13 at
once an obstruction to our industry, and a di-
minution of our property, we find that the
constitution of our country, which was pur-
chased for us at the expense of the lives of
our ancestors, has by the violence and intrigue
of criminal and designing men, been injured
aad undermined in its most essential and im-
pettant parts, but particularly in the House of
Commons, where the whole of the supposed
representation of the people is neither more
nor less than an usurped power’—I hope,
gentlemen, it cannot be required that I should
contend against such an assertion in this

lace, if a court of law in this country has not
ost all the character that belongs to law ;
how that usurped power was ever to be em-
ployed as an organ in the constitution of that
new representative body that this society atm-
ed at, consistent with their own principles, re-
mains to this moment unintelligible to me—
‘arising either from abuses in the mede of elec-
tion and duration of parliaments, or from a
corrupt property in certain decayed corpora-
tions, by means of which the liberties of this
nation are basely bartered away from the
bribed profit of the members of parliament:
and as it farther appears to ws, that until this
source of corruption shall he cleansed by the
determination, perseverance, firmness, and
union of the people at large, we are robbed of
the inheritance so acquired for us by our fore-
fathers, and that our taxes, instead of being
lessened, will go on increasing, as they
will furnish more bribes, places, and pensions,
to ministers and members of parliament: we
therefore, having resolved to unite ourselves
into one firm and permanent body, for the
purpose of informing ourselves and others of
the exact state of the present parliamentary
Tepresentation, for obtaining a peaceful but
adequate remedy to this intolerable grievance,
and for corresponding and co-operating with
other societies, united for the same objects,
have unanimously adopted the following
regulations for the internal order and go-
vernment of our society.” They then state
their regulations ; and their constitution hav-
ing been thus formed, they publish it after-
wards in the month of May. What observa-
tions they state to the public upon it in the
month of May I shall have occasion to repre-
sent presently ; you will see the manner of
proceeding with respect to the election of
their delegates, by the production of a parti-
cular paper. On the 13th of April, a person,
whom you have heard much of Mr. Marga-
rot,* is appointed a delegate; upon the 30th
of April, Mr. Vaughan was, as tar as the pa-
Per is evidence of the fact, appointed delegate

683,


named in
this indictment, and Mr, a another
party, inst whom the grand jury have
found abil, but who is not caandiea this in-
dictment, are also appointed delegates. Mr.
Hardy is not only secretary, but he is ap-
pointed, upon the 13th of April a delegate ;
and there is a choice of delegates for the
whole of these bodies. You will find they
afterwards met from time to time, to pur-
sue the great purposes of their incor,
tion, at an alehouse, I think, the Bell in
Exeter street, in the Strand, from which place
some of the correspondence I am abontto state
to you comes.

Gentlemen, the Society for Constitutional .
Information, having afhliated several socie-
ties very suddenly with themselves—whether
Mr. Paine remained in this country or not I
cannot tell—they felt an inclination to affiliate
with another society, which is to be, as it ap-
pears to me, in justice to them, very strongly
distinguished indeed with respect to the prin-
ciples upon which they acted, I mean the
socicty calling itself the Friends of the Peo-
ple, meeting at Free Masons’ Tavern: with
what prudence or discretion that society
formed itself is a subject which I shall not
discuss, but it is a most important fact, that in
the first attempt, which the Society for Con-
stitutional Information made (and it ought to
be known in justice to the Friends of the Peo-
ple), the first attempt they made to affiliate
themselves with the Society of tha Friends of.
the People, that society, in correspondence
that will be read to you, acts as some indivi-
dual members of tlie Constitutional Society
had done ; they say —‘* No, we discover your
design from what you are doing; you tell us,
from your approbation of resolutions entered
into at Manchester, signed by Mr. Walker
and Mr. Jackson, that you approve the sort of
schemes Mr. Paine has set forth;—that you
approve projects of giving, im loose and inde-
finite terms, the full extent a what you a
the rights of the ple, to the people: that
is Ai see intent ae think,”—and, gentie-
men, many a man may very honestly thinic
it, but he must go about the execution of his
thoughts in a leyal way, if he does so think,
if he means to reduce his thoughts into prae-
tice—“ we think that parliament is not ade-
quate to all the ends for which it is instituted
as a body, through which is to be spoken, as
far as the constitution requires, the will of the
people; but we do not mean what you mean;
we mean to preserve the forms of the consti-
tution, which itis clear you do not; we mean,”
says lord John Russell, in a letter, which will
be read, “ to preserve the forms of the con-
stitution, and therefore must decline all cor-
respondence with you.”

Gentlemen, it happens—it belongs to se-
cieties of this nature, and I desire to he
understood, therefore, in stating it, only es

| stating a circumstance, which in its nature

does belong to those societies, and which will

happen—that it was thought necessary, for |
the great purpose of doing that which was
eventually to be done, that a society, which
had rejected co-operation with the Society for
Constitutional Information, should still be
kept, for the purposes of the Society for Con-
stitutional Information, in fact and effect
corresponding and connected with it. Ac-
cordingly Pi will find that this Suciety of the
Friends of the People, rejecting upon principle
the plan which they thought abandoned the
forms of the constitution, that this society
retained, in its own bosom, according to the
account J have of it, many members, who
happened to belong to the other society, and
the work of both societies went on by the
same instruments: they were thus therefore
connected in fact, though they did not choose
as a body to have one society in connexion
with the other.

Gentlemen, having stated that, you will
allow me now to mention, though it is a little
out of date, but it also connects itself with
and illustrates the last observations I made,
that the society at Sheffield, which had con-
nected itself by affiliation with the Society for
Constitutional Information, and you will also
find with the London Corresponding Society,
had received, about the 24th of May, intelli- |
ae from the Society of the Friends of the

eople, which stated to them very correctly
what their objects were, the means by which
they meant to accomplish them, and the
attention which they meant to pay to the
forms of the constitution. Youwill now see
what the Society for Constitutional Informa-
tion understood to be the objects of the
Sheffield Society, and what the Sheffield
Society understood to be the objects of the
Society for Constitutional Information. The
Sheffield Society (though I do not know that
they kept their word) distinctly disavowed, in
a letter of the 26th May, to the Constitutional |
Society, having any thing more to do with
that socleyy called: the Friends of the People
—which meant to preserve the forms of the
constitution ; represented that they had totally
misunderstood them, and would have nothing
more to do with them, but to the extent, to
which the Society for Constitutional Informa-
tion permitted.

You will find in a letter from Sheffield, of
the 26th of May, and this corrected by Mr.
Tooke, that they thank the Constitutional
Society for accepting their members. They
then state that they had increased to two
thousand four hundred.—* On Saturday last,
the 19th instant, we received a packet of
iale addresses, resolutions, &c. from the

iety (Free Masons’ Tavern), which, on
mature consideration, we find ourselves not so
well reconciled to the ideas they convey to us
as we could wish, if they had appeared in a
different point of view; nor do they afford us
such a Being pecapect, as we were appre-
hensive might be expected from an associa-
tion of so respectable a body, under the high


denomination of ‘the Friends of the People.
In our opinion, their answer of the 19th
instant to your letter of the 27th ultimo is no
ways compatible with that appellation ;_ from
the known respectability of many names
which appear amongst them, we had enter-
tained great i ot their real use,”—mark
the words, gentlemen—“ in obtaining a tho-
rough reform”—now mind what that reform
is—“ in obtaining a thorough reform upon
the principles of the rights of man,”—that is,
@ representative government, rejecting the
king, and rejecting every other part of the
constitution of this country, except so far as it
was consistent (indeed it is not consistent
with any part of them) with the principles of
the rights of man—“ which can never be ac-
complished until every man enjoys his lawful
and just privileges.

* Previous to the reception of this packet,
we did communicate to them by letter the
pleasing hopes it reflected on us on looking
forward, viewing such respectable characters
signalizing themselves in support of the
people’s rights, agreeable to the above princi-
pe and the denomination by which they

ave entitled themselves, &c. In due course
they would receive our letter last Thursday
seven-night; and in consequence, we appre-
hend the packet was forwarded to us on the
same day, but without any written communi-

' cation. We shall not attempt any further

communication with them, until we are
favoured with your sentiments upon the
subject, or until matters of doubt which are at
present entertained be removed.” Then there
1s a note, which shows the necessity of this
fostering care of the Constitutional Society:
they say— Birmingham in particular claims
all the assistance from established societies,
which possibly can be administered.”

Having written to the Constitutional Society
upon the 26th of May, they find it expedient,
for the same purpose, to trouble their corres-
pondents of the London Corresponding Society ;
“We were favoured with your very affectio-
nate letter of the 7th ultimo, and communica-
tion, in due course; and I am directed by
this society to inform you, that it is with
infinite satisfaction they receive the informa-
tion, that your firm and laudable endeavours
are directed to that effectual and necessary
purpose, of opening and enlightening the

ublic mind, and disseminating useful know-
edge amongst the general mass of the people :
by an orderly proceeding in a firm pursuit of
truth and equity, there cannot be a doubt but
that our joint endeavours will in due time be
crowned with success.

“ As brothers and fellow-labourers we con-
gratulate you on the rapid progrees of useful
and real knowledge in the various parts of this
nation, which sufficiently indicates that the
time cannot be far distant when truth will
be more predominant, equity more gererally
administered, and sound wisdom more uni-
versally sought after. When pride, ambition,

‘

and ignorance give place to these virtues,
when oppression ceases and charity abounds,
when men in principle and practice verify the
necessity and advantage of doing to others as
they wish to be done by; then, and not till
Noe can any people or nation be said to be

We have herewith enclosed our rules,
&c. Should have written you much sooner,
but on account of a diappointment in the
printing of our articles, &c.

“Our numbers continue to increase, both
here, and in the adjacent towns and villages ;
a general coucurrence prevails, as to the
necessity of the business, and the measures
adopted by this society for obtaining our
object. It will be of great importance to the
cause we are engaged in, that a more frequent
communication be maintained amongst: all
the similar institutions; for which reason we
beg the favour of your correspondence at
every convenient specrtaplyy which will be
highly obliging to this society, who in return
pledge themselves to observe the same rule.”

Gentlemen, having stated to you now what
it was that the Society of the Friends of the
People discovered to be the object of the
Constitutional Society, and I agreeing with
them in thinking their discovery upon that
subject was accurate and right, you will find
it necessary to go back, and to proceed in the
order of time to the 7th of April. Mr. Hardy
sent from the London Corresponding Society
a copy of their resolutions to the Society for
Constitutional Information, which was estab-
lished at Manchester, and desired also to
have correspondence with them, as they were

engaged in one common cause; that
Manchester Society, you will recollect, which
hoped that the other great benefits which
Mr. Paine had stated, would be carried into
effect.

He says, “ We began this society about ten
weeks ago; it is composed chiefly of trades-
men and shopkeepers. The enclosed will
inform you of the principles we set out upon.
—When we first associated, we flattered our-
selves that no other societies in the nation
were formed upon the same principles—butin
two or three weeks afterwards we were most
agreeably informed of our brethrenat Sheffield
having taken the lead in so glorious a cause
—we immediately wrote to them, and were
answered without delay, expressing a wish to
unite with us, for promoting the ends we
have in view, and we are assured of success,
by persevering prudently, and with unani-
mity.”

Upon the 18th of April 1799, in furtherance
of this plan, you will find Mr. Hardy writes a
letter to the president of the society in the
Borough—Now that is the society, the prin-
ciples of which I have so distinctly stated
before, as leading to representative government,
as the only security for liberty in the country.
—It appears that their declarations had also
been sent to the London Corresponding


Society; and Mr. Hardy, upon the 18th of
April 1792, says “ I am ordered by the Lon-
don Corresponding Society, to send a copy of
their resolutions to the society that meets at
the Three Tuns tavern, in the Borough,
established on purpose for restoring the rights
of election, or in other words, to obtain aug
equal representation of the people of this
nation in parliament.” ;

Now they had avowed, and avowed in
their declaration, that their object of a repre-
sentation of the people in parliament was
precisely that more extended one in its prin-
ciple, which obtained at the time _of the
Commonwealth in England—namely, a re-
presentation of the people in parliament,
termed a parliament, but without King oF
Lords, a representative government—“* We
should: be very happy to enter into a corres-
pondence with your society—as we are all
engaged in the same grand and important
cause, there is an absolute necessity for us to
unite together, and communicate with each
other, that our sentiments and determinations
may centre in one point, viz. to have the
rights of man re-established, especially in this
nation; but our views of the rights of man
are not confined solely to this small island,
but are extended to the whole human race—
black or white, high or low, rich or poor. I
give you the following as my own opinion—
perhaps you may think it a singular senti-
ment”—and then an opinion is given, which
it is my duty to state, though I do not under-
stand it—* that the king and the nobles, as
much as the peasant and ignoble, are equally

deprived of their rights.—Our society meets ~

every Monday night.”

Gentlemen, there is an answer to this, from
a person of the name, I think, of Favell, who
is chairman of the Friends of the People in
Southwark: he says—“ I duly received your
letter, containing the resolutions of the Lon-
don Corresponding Society—which I have
communicated tu our society in the borough—
andI am directed to return them the thanks of
that society, and to assure them they shall cor-
dially unite with them, and all similar socie-
ties throughout the kingdom, in endeavouring
to effect those great objects for which they
are associated—namely, to engage the atten-
tion of their fellow-citizens to examine the
general abuses of government, and to exercise
their deliberative wisdom in a calm but intre-
pid manner in applying those remedies.”—
This is in April ; and in August they express-
ly tell you, that there was to be no remedy
from parliament—“ in applying those reme-
dies which the country at tage may ultimate-
ly require—and they sincerely agree with you

in hoping that the long-neglected rights of”

a

man will be restored, notonly in this country, |

but in every part of the globe where man may
dwell.—We shall very soon transmit you a
copy of our declaration, and hope for your
farthur correspondence.”

A letter aud resolutions from the Revolu-


tion and Constitutional Societies at Norwich, |
dated 26th of April 1792, were read at the |
meeting of the society for Constitutional In- :
formation, on the 4th of May following: they
distinctly state—that Mr. Paine’s books were
to be the medium, through which the preju- ;
dices that had grown up under the British -
ernment were to be get rid of, and the ;

‘onstitutional Society return them theirthanks |
jn these words—“ This society receives the
‘above communication with the most heartfelt
satisfaction, and desires earnestly to concur
and co-operate with those societies in their

- Jaudable objects ; that the secretary do inform
them of the same, and that this society has
unanimously elected the twelve members of |

“the Norwich societies to be associated mem-
ders of this society.” ;

Upon the 11th of May 1792, the Constitu-
tional Society resolved, that there should be a
‘communication from that society with the so-
ciety of the Friends of the Constitution at Pa-
ris, known by the name of Jacobins: they
send an address to them, which is in these |
words—* Brothers and fellow-citizens of the
world—

“The cordial and affectionate reception
with which you have honoured our worthy
countrymen, Mr. Thomas Cooper, and Mr.
James Watt, members of the society of Man-
chester, and united with our society, has been
communicated to us by the correspondence of
those gentlemen.

‘In offering you our congratulations on the
‘glorious revolution which your nation has ac-
complished, we speak a language which only
sincerity can dictate.

“ The formality of courts affords no exam-
ple tous: to do our thoughts justice, we give
to the heart the liberty it delights in, and
hail you as brothers.

“It is not among the least of the revolu-
tions which time is unfolding to an astonished
world, that two nations, nursed by some
wretched craft in reciprocal hatred, should so
suddenly break their common odious chain,
and rush into amity.

“ The principle that can produce such an
effect is the offspring of no earthly court; and
whilst it exhibits to us the expensive iniquity
of former politics, it enables us with bold feli- |

‘eity to say we have done with them.

* In contemplating the political condition of
‘nations, we cannot conceive a more diaboli-
cal system of government than that which has
been generally practised over the world, to
feed the avarice, and gratify the wickedness
of ambition ; the fraternity of the human race
has been destroyed, as if the several nations
of the earth had been created by rival gods—

“man has not considered man as the work of
one creator.

% The political institutions, under which he
has lived, have been counter to whatever re-
ligion he professed. .

“Instead of that universal benevolence,

-which the morality of every known religion |

+
|

+


declares, he bas been politically bred to con-
sider his species as his natural enemy, and to
describe virtues and vices by a geugraphical
chart.

“The principles we now declare are not pe-
culiar to the society that addresses you; they
are extending themselves with accumulatin
force through every part of our country, an
derive strength from an union of causes,

| which no other principles admit.

“The religious friend of man, of every deno-
mination, records them as his own ; they ani-
mate the lover of rational liberty, and they
cherish the heart of the poor, now bending un-
ae a oppression of taxes, by a prospect of
relief,

“We have against us only that same ene-
my, which is the enemy of justice in all coun-
tries, a herd of courtiers fattening on the spoil
of the public.

It would have given an additional triumph
to our congratulations, if the equal rights of
man, which are the foundation of your
declaration of rights, had been recognised by
the governments around you, and tranquillit
established in all; but, if despotisms be still
reserved to exhibit, by conspiracy and combi-
nation, a further example of infamy to future
ages, that power that disposes of events, best
knows the means of making that example
finally beneficial to his creatures.

“ We have beheld your peaceable principles
insulted by despotic ignorance ; we have seen
the right hand of fellowship, which you hold
out to the world, rejected i those who riot
on its plunder; we now behold you a nation
provoked into defence, and we can see no
mode of defence equal to that of establishing
the general freedom of Europe.

“ln this best of causes we wish you suc-
cess; our hearts go with you; andin saying
this we believe we utter the voice of millions.”

Gentlemen, this address was signed by the
chairman of the Constitutional Society, and
transmitted to Mr. Watt, at Paris; and, upon
the 28th of May 1792, was ordered to be pub-
lished.

After this, the principles of Mr. Paine,
which, you observe, contain the doctrines that
TI have been stating to you, were carried far-
ther in a third book (I’ mean in that book
called the Address to the Addressers, which I
shail also be able to give in evidence to you) :
Mr. Paine having there gone the length of as-
serting the folly, absurdity, and wickedness of
the government, under which we live—not
only of asserting the incompeteney of govern-
ment, as it is constituted, to change itself, but
having asserted that a conventionary repre-
sentation of the people, in that sense in which
we speak of it, must do this work, he pro-
ceeds to the extent of stating the plan and
form of an organization of that sort, upon
which the convention was to be framed.

Gentlemen, it was impossible not toapply to
the justice of the law, against the attack made
upon our government by the person who

went to the extent I am now stating, with
the approbation, published over and over
again, of these societies, who, in their corpo-
rate character, if I may so speak, could not be
prosecuted for doing 1t—it became necessary
to ask a juty of this country, whether these
doctrines were to be tolerated—what is “the
consequence of that? [t is, that these socie-
ties immediately enter into subscriptions for
the support of Mr. Paine, and they consider
themselves as engaged in propagating his
works in that way, in which no work ever was
propagated —to the intent to produce that
convention, without which the nation, in no
organization of its government, could be said,
according to them, to exist in a state of free-
dom as a nation.

Gentlemen, you will not be surprised, if it
also appears that, in going on progressively to
the execution of the mischief that was intend-
ed, they became more mischievous; and you
will find members parting from the seciety,
expressly telling them, that they meant to
destroy the government of the country ; that
they cannot, therefore, stay among them ;
and to which members, as far as appears from
any information that I have had, they did not
condescend to explain themselves—to say,
No, you have mistaken our object—this is
not what we mean; but they leave them un-
answered, and go on to execute the purposes
they were about.

Having come to those resolutions in order to
support Mr. Paine in these prosecutions, they
publish the resolutions, they publish the books
of Mr..Paine, they publish these resolutions in
the various newspapers (the editors of these
newspapers insuring, if I may so say, them-
selves against the hazards of the law, some tor

more, some for less, and theyrisk the hazard of

Propagating the doctrines, provided the consi-
deration paid is ample enough, as a premium for
the risk), and then these publications are sent
down to the country to various places, in hun-
dreds, and thousands—I am sorry to say, to
persons of all professions, to distribute—I am
Sorry to say, to some of the most sacred pro-
fessions, whose numes will appear to you when
they come to be read—and this mode of propa-
aling these doctrines is adapted to the utter
mpossibility of detection, and for the very
piece of having that effect—to make the
aw of the country unequal to the mischief,
which it was to meet.
Atthis time a proclamation was issued hy

the executive government of the country, in |

order to restrain these publications; and both
the societies, you will find, cloaking theim-

selves under the words “a full and fair repre- |

sentation of the people,” which words they

have never condescended to explain, which .

words never do exist in any text of any writ-
ing of theirs, as I can find, with the mention
ofa king, or other house of legislature :—they


should spread the effect of the mischief more
widely and diffusely than otherwise they could
have done.

Upon the 24th of May 1792, there isa let-
ter sent from Mr. Hardy, I believe not in his
own hand-writing, but I believe in the hand-
writing of Mr. Vaughan, whom [ before nam-
ed to you, in which he states, that, by the di-
rection of the London Correspunding Society,
he had the honour of enclosing to them a
copy of their address and regulations, which
he requests they will communicate to: the
Constitutional Society. The thanks of the so-
ciety were given to them for this; and that
is a publication more guarded than anothet
you will find published upon the 6th of Aus
gust 1792,

After stating their constitution, which I bes
fore mentioned to you, it says— But, as Pros
vidence has furnished men in every statioa
with faculties necessary fur judging of what
concerns themselves, shall we, the multitude,
suffer a few, with no better right than our-
selves, to usurp the power of governing us
without control? Surely not: let us rathef
unite in one common cause to cast away our
bondage, being assured, that in so doing we
are protected by a jury of our countrymen,
while we are discharging a duty to ourselves,
to our country, and to mankind.”

Gentlemen, you will find from a paper of
the 6th of August, that that, which they
supposed was to meet with protection from a
jury of the country, was a ccmbination to re+
form the government of the country by
means—other than application to parliament
—which binds together, with the king, as the
great political body of the country, the whole
system under which we live.

Gentlemen, the London Corresponding Sos
ciety, as to the king’s proclamation, followed
the example of the Canatitunonal Society,
and, on the 3tst of May, 1792, in a paper
that will be read to you, they vilify the pro-
clamation ; and this paper having been com-
municated by the London Corresponding So-~
ciety to the Constitutional Society — they,
aware of the nature of it, order, that that
paper should be published in such newspapers
as will receive the advertisements of this so-
cicty.— They were pretty well aware that
they were of such a nature as made it some-
what hazardous to publish them,

You will find a letter, dated the 14th of
June, 1792, trom certain persons styling
themselves the Editors of the Patriot (whe
they are Iam not able to state to you, but
who, for the purposes of these societies,
thought it necessary to conceal their names),
in which they desire the Corresponding
Society to take am opportunity of enlight-
ening the public mind by publications, by
advertisements, by circulating those papers
in villages to country farmers, desiring, as I

vilify the proclamation, and they make tie | stated, to conceal their name, but requesting
very means the executive government took to | that the papers might be sent-to a person,
suppress the mischief a mean by which they | why holds an important situation in a subse-


\

x

ent part of this business—a Mr. Gale, a

kseller at Sheffield.

Gentlemen, there will be laid before you
various parts of the proceedings of the Consti-
tutional Society, which relate to Mr. Paine,
which I shall now pass over, except for the
purpose of calling your attention to another
publication of his upon the sixth of June,
1792, and which was addressed to Mr. Dun-
das; you will likewise find that that book,
which will be given you in evidence, dis-
tinctly disavows all hereditary government;
all monarchy, under whatever qualifications ;
and then, for the purpose of circulating this
doctrine, as they had before circulated the
doctrines in other works of this gentleman,
they order, “ that twelve thousand copies of
that letter shall be printed for the society, for
the purpose of being transmitted to our cor-
respondents throughout Great Britain, and
that a committee be appointed to direct the
same.”

Gentlemen, I pass on now to the 6th of
August, 1792; at which time there appears to
me to have been an extremely important
transaction in the London Corresponding So-
ciety; it is the propagation of an address of
that date, which first developes, as it seems
to me, though in somewhat of covert lan-
guage, the determination of these societies to
work what they call a reform without any
communication whatever with that parlia-
ment, which they held to be incompetent to
bring about the business. .

You will find that, upon the &th of August,
Mr. Hardy wrote a letter to Mr. Tooke; that
he sent him a proof copy of this address; that
he hoped it would merit his attention, and
his approbation; that he should be exceed-
ingly happy to be favoured with his opinion
of it before it was printed.

_. The address, after stating what they consi-
dered as the grievances of the country, states

this— Such being the forlorn situation of |

three fourths of the nation, how are Britons
to obtain information and redress? Will the
Court, will ministry afford either? Will par-
liament grant them? Will the nobles or the
clergy ease the people’s sufferings? No.
Experience tells us, and proclamations con-
firm it, that the interest and intention of power
are combined tu keep the nation in torpid
ignorance.”

‘ “It then states the only resource to be in
these societies; it then states various detailed
reasons, which you will hear, and then pro-
ceeds to this effect:

“ Numerous other reforms would un-
doubtedly take place, even in the first session
of parliament so elected, dependant only on
their electors the peoples untorn therefore
by faction, undivided party, uncorrupted
by ministry, and uninfluenced but by the
public good. Every transaction would tend
to reform, aud a strict economy, its natural
consequence, might soon enable us to reduce
our taxes ; and by the integrity of parliament,


that reduction would light upon such objects
as best might relieve the poor; this to the
people would prove an advantageous and a
novel session, and to an honest parliament
not a tiresome one.

“ Therefore, Britons, friends, and fellow.
citizens, with hand and heart unite, claim
what is your right, persevere and be free, for
who shall dare withstand our just demands?
Oppression, already trembling at the voice of
individuals, will shrink away and di
for ever, when the nation united shall assert
its privileges and demand their restoration.”

Gentlemen, the address you will find was
circulated with infinite industry to every cor-
respunding society in the kingdom, conveyed
through every possible channel, the doctrine
adopted by all the affiliating societies; ard
the plan, which they went upon from this
6th of Augus& 1792, appears to have been a
plan to redress themselves by their own

ower, and by their own strength, and not
by application to that parliament, which
alone can act in legislation: it seems to me
to be impossible that you can mistake what
is meant by this paper, if you will give your
more particular attention to a paper which
was received from a society at Stockport,
upon the 27th of November, 1792, and found
in the possession of Mr. Hardy: this, aftes
adverting to those numerous grievances stated
in the address of the 6th of August, 1792, is
to this effect:

“ In obedience to the wishes ef the soeiety
here, I have the pleasure of acknowledging
the honour of your letter, and the packet,
which the kindness of our brothers of the
London Corresponding Society so opportuncly
presented us with.

“It is doubly deserving our thanks, as it
shows your kindness, and as it will be useful
in the formation of our infant society ; we
stand much in need of your experience in
thig particular, and we doubt not of your best
assistance; we are surrounded by a majority,
a formidable one indeed in power, abilities,
and numbers, but we are not dismayed.

“ We have carefully perused the addresses,
and I am to observe upon their contents in
general, that the sentiments hardly arise to
that height which we expert from men sensible
to their full claims to absolute and unconrtrol-
luble liberty, i. e. unaccountable to any power
which they have not immediately constituted
and appointed.

“ These are our sentiments, whatever may
be yours; though, in the present state of po-
litical knowledge, it may be prudent not to
avow them openly. We desire your senti-
ments on the means of accomplishing that
object, which we presume you have in
view in common with us; we think it expe-
dient that we should perfectly understand
each other in the beginning, lest the appear-
ance of disunion might furnish matter of
triumph to our enemies ; we observe one ex-
pression,’—you will take notice that Mr.

Hardy at this time was a member both of the
London Corresponding and the Constitutional
Societies: —“* we observe one expression,
which says, ‘ numerous other reforms would
* take place,’ &c. &c.; but we ask how is
that parliament to be chosen? Can we er-
fet st from the present order of things?

ould not all the evil be done away at once
by the people assembling in convention ? Does
it appear probable that the odious laws which
we complain of, will be abolished any other
way? Can the grievances arising from aris-
tocracy be redressed while the re-
tains its present authority in the legislature ?”
—whether this blank is to be filled up with
crown or the House of Lords is for you to
judge—* retains its present authority in the
legislature? Is the universal right of con-
science ever to be attained while the B——
maintain their seats onthe =~

“ Your thoughts on these important points
-we most earnestly desire may be transmitted
to us as soon as possible, not directed as the
Jast,”—and this you will find often occurs ;
letters sent under a feigned direction; “ we
fear it will excite suspicion.”

The Stockport Society say of the address
of the 6th of August, 1792, sent tothem, that
they think it hardly amounts to sentiments
such as theirs, namely, that they must have
absolute and uncontrollable liberty, unac-
countable to any power which they have not
immediately constituted—that could not be
the king and parliament of Great Britain—
they say, ““ We presume you have the same
view in common with us, and we desire to
have your sentiments upon the means of ac-
complishing that object.” What object?
The object of putting themselves in a situa-
tion of being unaccountable to any power,
which they themselves had not immediately
constituted and appointed—how was that to
be done ?—was it to be done by parliament?
The address of the 6th of August had dis-
avowed that it was to be done by parliament.
Is it to be done, while the other parts of the
legislature hold their situation in the legisla-
ture? We presume you have the same ob-
ject: tell us what you think upon this ocea-
sion. This was the occasion, upon which
the address of the 6th of August ought to
have been explained, if they meant to disavow
that they had any such object ; but what is
the answer ?—The answer in effect is: That
full and fair representation of the people that
we are aiming at, is that which Is to be the
mediate or immediate instrument of removing
all the grievances we labour under, though
prudence does not permit us to speak all we
think upon the subject.

* With infinite satisfaction the London Cor-
responding Society’s committee perused your
letter; they are happy to learn your steady
determination, in spite of all obstacles, to pur-
sue that sole means of political felicity, a per-
fect representation of the people.”

* Now, what was the sole means of this

t

i

{


political felicity—a perfect representation of
the people?—It was the formation of a power
by the people making themselves unaccount-
able to any other power, to any power but
that which they had immediately themselves
constituted, namely, an assembly by a conven-
tion of the people. Then, why do not they
speak out? They say, “ With regard to our
publications, our sentiments are expressed in
as strong terms as prudence will permit, yet
plain enough to convince the public, that,
while we expect. every thing from an honest

; and an annual parliament,”—a body might

exist under the term parliament in a com-
monwealth, as well as under a king—* no-

| thing short of such a senate, chosen by the
i whole nation, will satisfy us.

“ True generosity, the characteristic of this
nation, and of all unperverted men thoughout

| the globe, calling upon us to countenance at
this juncture the arduous struggle of the

French nation against despotism and aristo-

i

' cracy, those foes to the human race, we have

‘ resolved upon addressing the French National
_ Convention.” You will permit me to observe,

this was upon the 11th of October 1792: the
king of France was deposed in effect upon the
10th of August 1792. This passage, in the
transactions of this society, appears to me te
be peculiarly worthy your attention. “ With-
out entering into the probable effects of such

, a measure, effects, which your society will not
| fail to discover, we invite you to join us; and

to that end, herewith you have a copy of our
intended address; if you approve the idea,

| and will concur in sending it, be pleased to

return us without delay, a copy signed by

‘your president: we will then associate your
| body with ours, and with some others, who

have already assented to the measure: if, on
the contrary, you disapprove that mark of zeal
towards the only nation that has hitherto un-
dertaken to restore to mankind its just rights,
please to communicate to us your objections.”
This was upon the 11th of October 1792; upon
the 6th of October 1792, Mr. Barlow (whose
name occurs before with respect to his publi-
cation relative to the privileged orders) writes
a letter to the socicty for Constitutional In-
formation, accompanied with a book, called
“ Advice to the National Convention of
France ;” and you will be pleased to observe,
that Mr. Barlow, and a Mr Frost * after-
wards, in the month of November, were sent
with an address from the Constitutional So-
ciety to Paris, as their delegates for that pur-
pose, The letter of Mr. Barlow. is in these
words:

“ T have lately published a small treatise
under the title of ‘A Letter to the Nation
“Convention of France, on the Defects of the
“Constitution of 1791, and the extent of the
“Amendments which ought to be applied :’
although the observations contained in this



letter are more particularly applicable to the
French nation in the present crisis of its go-
vernment, yet, as the true principles of so-
ciety are every where the same, their examina-
tion cannot be unseasonable in any nation, or
at any time; believing, therefore, that the
subject of this treatise will not be thought
foreign to the great object of your association,
I present a copy of it to you with the same
coulidence as I have done to the National
Canvention, and to the Constitutional Society
at London, a confidence arising trom the full
persuasion that the work is founded in truth
and reason. I take the liberty at the same
time to send you a copy of another publication,
intituled ‘ Advice to Privileged Orders.’ The
present disposition in Europe towards a gene-
Tal revolution in the principles of government
is founded in the current of opinin, too power-
ful to be resisted, as well as too sacred to be
treated. with negicct; and it is the duty of
every individual to assist, not only in remov-
ing the obstructions that are found in the way
of this revolution, but in ascertaining, with as
much precisivn as possible, the nature of the
object to be aimed at, and the consequence to
be expected from the attainment: it is above
all things to be desired, that the convictions
to be acquired from national discussion
should precede and preclude those which must
result from physical exertion.”

Now, you will give me leave to state to you
what the doctrine is in this book, for which
the Society for Constitutional Information,
Mr. Hardy then a member of it, thank Mr.
Barlow, make him an honorary member, and
afterwards depute him to the National Con-
vention of France. :

Gentlemen, the doctrine, I can explain it to
you generally, without troubling you by read-
Ang particular passages, amounts to this: Mr.
Barlow, after stating the principles of equal
active citizenship, which found their way into
the constitution of France in 1791, and which
constitution had made the king a part of the
system of that government, informs them of
the glorious victory of the 10th of August, as
the papers, which I have to adduce presently,
represent it; that it had accomplished finally
the effect of those principles, which he under-
stands to be the principles of those to whom
he was writing; that it is impossible they
should consist with this sentiment, (hat a king
could be retained in a government; that the
constitution was at variance with itself; that
those who made it had not discovered that,
or, having discovered it, they thought the
time was not yet come, when they could re-
duce the constitution to that pure government
which was the objectof these societies; hethen
tells you, that in government the maxim being
that a king can do no wrong, the maxim onght
to be, that he can du no good.

This gentleman, so stating his doctrine as an
explanation of the principles upon which they
are acting, is voted by them an honorary mem-
ber, and afterwards sent to Paris with the


[312

papers, which I am about to read to yon: 4
great deal of evidence will be laid before you,
to prove that they had beat up all the country
for letters and addresses to express the same
principles to France, uot on account of the
cause of France, but of the cause of Eng-
land, and with a view to introduce the same
effects into England. I shall state but two of
these addresses, because they seem to cun-
tain the effect of all the rest that were actue
ally sent.

The London Corresponding Society first of
all communicated to the Constitutional So-
ciety, in the month of October 1792, their in-
tention of sending an address to France: the
Constitutional Society fully approve the puts
pose; they see the end that it aims at, and
they determine not to concur in the same
address, but to send a separate address; and
in their paper you may see the principles of
both to be principles, which were expressed
for the very purpose of aiding the co-opera-
tion of the societies in excluding the king trom
the government of the country, and of raising
arepublic. This is the letter:

“ Frenchmen, while foreign robbers are ra-
vaging your territories under the specious pre-
text of justice, cruelty and desolation leadingin
their van, perfidy and treachery bringing up
the rear, yet mercy and friendship impudently
held forth to the world as the sole motives of
their incursions; the oppressed part of man-
kind”—that is, Great Lritain—* forgetting
for a while their own sufferings, feel only for
yours,’ and with an anaious eye watch the
event, fervently supplicating the Almighty
Ruler of the universe to be favourable to your
cause, so intimately blended with their own,”
that cause which upon the 10th of August
had excluded the king from the government
of the country—* frowned upon by an oppres-
sive system of control, whose gradual but con-
tinued encroachments have deprived this na-
tion of nearly all its boasted liberty, and
brought us almust to that abject state of
slavery, from which you have so emerged ;
five thousand British citizens indignant man-
fully step forth to rescue their country trom
the opprobrium brought upon it by the supine
conduct of those in power; they conceive it
to be the duty of Britons to countenance and
assist, to the utmost of their power, the cham-
pions of human happiness, and to swear to a
nation, proceeding on the plan you have
adopted, an inviolable friendship. Sacred
from this day be that friendship between us,
and may vengeance, to the uttermost, over:
take the man who hereafter shall attempt to
cause a rupture.

“ Though we appear so few at present, be
assured, Frenchmen, that our number in-
creases daily: it is true, that the stern up-
lifted arm of authority at present keeps back
the timid; that busily circulated impostures
hourly mislead the credulous ; and that court
intimacy with avowed French traitors has
sume ellect on the unwary and on the ambi-

tious; but with certainty we can inform you,
friends and freemen, that information makes
a rapid progress among us; curiosity has taken
possession of the public mind; the conjoint
reign of ignorance and despotism passes away;
men now ask each other, What is freedom?
what are our rights? Frenchmen, you are
already free, and Britons are preparing to be-
come so; casting far from us the criminal
prejudices arttully inculcated by evil-minded
men and wily courtiers, we, instead of natural
enemies, at length discover in Frenchmen our
fellow-citizens of the world, and our brethren
by the samc heavenly Father, who created us
for the purpose of loving and mutually assist-
ing each other, but not to hate, and to be ever
realy to cuteach other’s throats at the com-
mand of weak and ambitious kings, and cor-
rupt ministers; seeking our real encmies,
we find them in our bosoms, we feel ourselves
inwardly torn by and ever the victim of a
restless and all-consuming aristocracy, hi-
therto the bane of every nation under the sun;
wisely have you acted in expelling it from
France.

“ Warm as our wishes are for your success,
eager as we are to behold freedom triumphant,
and man every where restored to the enjoy-
ment of lis just rights, a sense of our duty, as
orderly citizens, forbids our flying in arms to
your assistance ; our government has pledged
the national faith to remain neutral in a
struggle of liberty against despotism. Bri-
tons remain neutral !—O shame! but we have
trusted our king with discretionary powers;
we therefore must obey: our hands are
bound, but our hearts are free, and they are
with you.

“ Let German depots act as they please,
we shall rejuice at their fall; compassionat-
ing however their enslaved subjects, we hope
this tyranny of their masters will prove the
means of reinstating in the full enjoyment of
their rights and liberties millions of our fellow-
creatures.

“ With unconcern therefore we view the
elector of Hanover,”—that is, the king of

Great Britain—join his troops to traitors and |

robbers ; but the king of Great Britain will do
well to remember, that this country is not Ha-
nover. Should he forget this distinction, we
will not.

“ While you enjoy the envied glory of
being the unaided defenders of freedom, we
fondly anticipate in idea the numerous bless-
ings mankind will enjoy; if you succeed, as
we ardently wish, the triple alliance (not
of crowns, but) of the people of America
France, and Britain, will give freedom to Eu-
rope, and peace to the whole world. Dear
friends you combat for the advantage of the
human race; how well purchased will be,
though at the expense of much blood, the glo-
rious unprecedented privilege of saying,—
Mankind is free: tyrants aud tyranny are no
more : , and this is

e reigns on the
the wesk of Frenchmen,”


Gentlemen, this address, which was sent by
that society, was followed by another from
the Society for Constitutional Information,
upon the 9th of November 1792, which seems
likewise to state their principles.

“ Servants of a sovereign people, and bene-
factors of mankind ;—

“ We rejoice that your revolution has ar-
rived at that point of perfection which will
permit us to address you by this title,’—Ser-
vants of a sovereign people. That is not the
character of a British government; this is the
principle of the Southwark resolutions—* it
is the only one which can accord with the
character of true legislators. Every succes-
sive epoch in your affairs has added something
to the triumphs of liberty and the glorious
victory of the 10th of August has finally pre-
pared the way for a constitution, which we
trust you will establish on the basis of reason
and nature.” Mr. Barlow had in effect said
and they had made him an honorary member,
and had transmitted their address by his
hands), that no constitution could reform
upon the basis of reason and nature, that left
aking in the government, however the gor
vernment was modified.

They proceed thus in their address—
* Considering the mass of delusion, accumu-
Jated on mankind to obscure their understandy
ings, you cannot be astonished at the oppo-
sition, that you have met buth from tyrants
and from slaves ; the instrument used against
you by each of these classes is the same, tor,
in the genealogy of human miseries, ignorance
is at once the parent of oppression and the
child of submission. :

“ The events of oer day are proving, that
your cause is cherished by the people in all
your continental vicinity: that a majority
of each of those nations are your real friends,
whose governments have tutored them into
apparent foes; and that they only wait to
be delivered by your arms from the dreadful
necessity of fighting against them,

“ The condition of Englishmen is less to
be deplored ; here the hand of oppression has
not yet ventured completely to ravish the
pen from us, nor openly to point the sword at
you.”

? They then go on to say :—“ From bosoms
burning with ardour in your cause, we tender
you our warmest wishes for the full extent of

| ts progress and success; it is indeed a sacred

cause; we cherish it as the pledge of your hap-
piness, our natural and nearest friends, and we
rely upon it as the bond of fraternal union
to the human race, in which union our own
nation will surely be one of the first to concur.

“ Qur government has still the power and
perhaps the inclination to employ hirelings
to contradict us; but it is our real opinion,
that we now speak the sentiments of a great
majority of the English nation. The people
here are wearied with imposture, and worn
out with war, they heve learned to reflect
that beth the age and the other are the off-

spring of unnatural combinations if society,
as relative to systems of government, not
the result of the natural temper of nations as
relative to each others happiness.

“ Go on, legislators, in the work of human
happiness; the benefit will in part be ours,
but the glory shall be all your own; it Is the
reward of your perseverance, it is the prize of
virtue, the sparks of liberty preserved in Eng-
Jand for ages, like the coruscations of the Nor-
thern Aurora, serving but to show the dark-
ness visible in the rest of Europe. The lustre
of the American republic, like an effulgent
morning, arose with increasing vigour, but
still too distant to enlighten our hemisphere,
till the splendour of the French revolution
burst forth upon the nations in the full fervour
of a meridian sun, and displayed,”—attend to
the words—“in the midst of the European
world the practical result of principle which

hilosophy had sought in the shade of specu-
lation, and which experience must every
where confirm,”—the principles of Mr. Paine,
who went over to form one in that convention,
the existence of which shows the practical re-
sult of those principles, which philosophy had
sought, and which experience was to confirm
—it dispels the clouds of prejudice from all
people, reveals the secrets of all despotism,
and creates a new character in man.

“ In this career of improvement, your ex-
ample will be soon followed; for nations,
rising from their lethargy, will reclaim the
rights of man with a voice which man cannot
resist.”

Gentlemen, it will not be matter of surprise
to you, that letters, such as these to the Na-
tional Convention in France, should have pro-
duced opinions in that country respecting the
attachment of individuals in this to their go-
vernment. It is not therefore very extraordi-
nary, that, upon the 19th of November 1792,
that famous decree passed of fraternization
with all subjects in all countries, who chose to
resist the governments under which they live;
but I think you will be surprised that any
men could receive in this country, and read
with approbation, and enter upon their pro-
ceedings, the answers which these addresses
brought from France, and which were read in
the presence of the prisoner at the bar, with-
out being astonished that they did not at
least take some means to reject from them
the imputation that they meant in their own
country, all that these answers suppose they
mean, and all that these answers promise to
assist them in accomplishing.

You will find, upon the 14th of December
1792, that a letter from the Society of the
Friends of Liberty and Equality, sitting’ at
Laon, the head of the department of the Aisne,
to the Patriotic Society of London, called the

“Society for Constitutional Information, is read,
and referred to their Committee of Corres-
pondence: it isin these words :—The So-
ciety of the Friends of Liberty and Equality
sitting at Laon, the head of the department of


the Aisne, to the Patriotic Society of London,
called the Society for Constitutional Informa-
tion.—Generous republicans, the philanthro-
pic gift that you have presented to the war-
tiors of France”—they had sent some shoes,
and were at that time thinking of giving them
some arms—* announces with energy the great
interest that you take in the sacred cause
which they are defending. Accept the thanks
of a society that does honour to itself in
esteeming you. The time perhaps is not far
distant, when the soldiers of our liberty shall
be able to testify their gratitude to you: then
their arms, their blood itself, shall be at the
service of all your fellow-citizens, who, like
you, acknowledge no rights but the rights
ofman; then France and England shall form
together a treaty of union as lasting as the
course of the Seine and the Thames; then
there, as here, there shall exist no other reign
but that of liberty, equality, and friendship.
May this day of felicity and glory soon shine
upon the horizon of two nations formed to ad-
mire each other !”

Gentlemen, they then enter upon the mi-
nutes of the society another letter, from
another fraternizing society,—whether one of
those societies which they speak of in the be-

inning of 1792, as aftiliating societies in

rance, or not, I do not know ;— whether they
had been assisting to reduce their principles
into practice | do not know; but it is clear,
that the affiliating society in France offered
them their assistance for that purpose. Ac-
cordingly, you will find that the Society
of the Tats of Liberty and Equality, estab-
lished at Macon, write to the Constitutional
Society at London, adverting to what they had
said in their address to the nation about the
glorious victory of the 10th August 1792, the
circumstances of which shall be described to
you in evidence, because you will find that
some of the persons who are charged in this
indictment (and whose conduct in this con-
spiracy, will, upon the clearest principles of
law, affect all of them) were then present in
Paris. They write thus—* Yes, citizens, our
brethren and friends, the 10th of August
1792 shall be distinguisled”—what, in the
annals of France?—* distinguished in the
annals of the world, as the day of the triumph
of liberty, our first revolution”—(Mr. Joel
Barlow or Mr. Paine, one should have thought,
had wrote it)—“ our first revolution did but
show to us the salutary principles of the im-
prescriptible rights of man: all, except the
faithless and the enemies of humanity,
adopted them with enthusiasm. It was then
that we formed ourselves into a society,. in
order the better to impress them upon our-
selves, and afterwards to teach them to our
fellow-citizens.

“ Our first constitution had consecrated
them, but had not always taken them for its
base : the dominion of the passions, the force
of habit, the impression of prejudices, and the
power of the intrigues empiged in our Con-

stituent Assembly, found the secret to preserve
sufficient authority to our tyrants, to extin-
guish at some time the sacred rights of nature,
and to re-establish despotism on its throne of
iron.

‘ But royalty, thus preserved, was not con-

. tent with the victory secured to it by a set of
men, the greatest part of whom it had cor-
rupted. It was impatient to reap the fruits
that it appeared to promise itself; but its
too great eagerness has hastened its ruin, and
secured the triumph of reason.

«¢ The French, proud of their own existence,
soon perceived the fruit of their first legisla-
ture ; became sensible of the imperfections of
their first laws, saw that they made a surrender
of the rights of liberty and equality, which
they had embraced ;. they roused themselves
anew to demand at length laws impartial and
humane.

“ From thence the necessary day of the
10th of August 1792, from thence a second
revolution, but a revolution, which is only the
completion of the first, which has received
our vows and our oaths, and which we will
bless for ever, if it leads us, as we hope it
will, to the happiness of the nation, to the
constant maintenance of liberty and equality.

© Let intriguers, fools, and tyrants, calum-
niate us; we despise them too much to con-
descend to answer them, and seek for their
esteem.

“ That which flatters us is the interest that
you take in our labours: your attention has
contributed to the success of our arms. We
desire your esteem, we are proud of your ap-
probation.

“ We smile at the expression of the senti-
ments that you manifested to our representa-
tives. We behold a nation of brethren rouse
itself to support the cause of humanity; we
behold the brave English adopt our principles,
become our friends: we say to each other with
pleasure, soon will they become our allies;
and uniting our efforts, we shall go on to de-
liver the universe from the yoke of tyrants, to
restore the nations to reason and nature.
That day is not far distant, if we may rely on
our own courage, and the hope of youralliance.
In the mean time, receive our thanks, and cor-
Tespond with brethren who set a high value
upon your esteem.”

Gentlemen, on the 17th of December 1792,
the Popular and Republican Society of another
department at the mouth of the Rhone, wrote
them this letter: “The Popular and Repub-
lican Society of Apt, department of the Mouths
of the Rhone to the Popular Society sitting ut
London. Live free or die. Citizens, brethren,

’ and friends, when two great nations, acquaint-
ed with their rights, approximated by their
commercial connexions and their national
situation, formed to live and to act in concert
with each other, begin to form the glorious
project of uniting themselves for the regene-
ration of the human race, one may then say
with reason that kings are ripe and ready to


fall. How glorious it will be for France and
England to have furmed alone a confederacy
destructive of tyrants, and to have purchased
at the price of their blood the liberty of Eu-
rope; we may say more, of the whole uni-
verse! Courage, brethren and friends! I¢ is
for you to follow in the glorious and hazar-
dous career of the revolution of the world;
can you any longer groan under the yoke of a
overnment that has nuthing of liberty but
the name? for, althuugh your land was inha-
bited before ours by freemen, can you, with.
out delusion, consider your government as
such? Will you content yourselves with a
partial frecdom? Will the English be satisfied
with principles? Will that bold nation, that
has produced philosophers the most profound,
and that first of all perceived the sparkling
rays of freedom, remain a spectatrix in so
noble a cause? No, brethren and friends, no?
you will soon lift yourselves up against that
perfidious court of St. James's, whose infernal
policy, like that which found its doom in the
Thuilleries, has made so many victims in
our two nations, and does disunite them per-
etually to rule over them. Your love for
iberty has fixed your attention upon the
wants of our defenders: your generosity to-
wards them has a title to the a kaow ele
ment of the republic; we are impatient to
furnish you the same advantages: the Po-
pular Societies of France desire ardently
the epoch that shall permit them to address
their voice to the National Assembly of
Great Britain, and to offer to the soldiers of
liberty of your nation, arms, bayonets, and
pikes.”

This is the private correspondence between
the socictics and the Society for Constitutional
Information; but some of the persons named
in this Indictment were present at the scenes
I am now going to state at the bar of the
National Convention in France; others of
them delivering these sentiments by their
ambassador Mr. Barlow whose principles you
have seen, and Mr. Frost, of whom I must
state it, because I shall prove it, that he has
been convicted in this country of coming from
that country with the doctrine of No King;
they offer these addresses to the -National
Convention of France in terms, the substance
of which I will state to you as far as I under-
stand it, to be, and I believe it is an accurate
translation.

“ Mr. Barlow and Mr. Frost, English citi-
zens, being admitted to the bar, one of them
pronounced the following address.”—Gentle-
men, the actual fact of his pronouncing it will
be given in evidence: the date is the 28th of
November 1792, nine days after the decree of
the National Convention, which had promised
fraternal assistance to the subjects of any
country that found themselves oppressed by
any of their casts and privileged orders,

* Citizens of France, we are deputed from
the Society for Constitutional Information in
London, to present to you their congratulations

on the triumphs of liberty. This Society had
laboured long in the cause with little prospect
of success previous to the commencement of
your revolution; conceive then their exulta-
tions and gratitude when, by the astonishing
efforts of your nation, they beheld the reign
of reason acquiring an extension and solidity
which promised to reward the labour of all
good men, by securing the happiness of their
fellow-creatures. nf mrenitas societies of a
similar nature are now forming in every part
of England, Scotland and Ireland; they excite
a spirit of universal inquiry into the compli-
cated abuses of government, and the simple
means of areform. Afterthe example which
France has given, the science of revolutions
will be rendered easy, and the progress of rea-
son will be rapid. It would not be strange
if, in a period tar short of what we should ven-
ture to predict, addresses of felicitation should
cross the seas to a National Convention in
England. We are also commissioned to in-
form the Convention, that the society which
we represent has sent to the soldiers of liberty
& patriotic donation of a thousand pair of shoes,
which are by this time arrived at Calais; and
the society will continue sending a thousand
pair a week for at least six weeks to come;
we only wish to know to whose care they
ought to be addressed.”

- Why, Gentlemen, am I to be told then,
that, in the month of November 1792, those
who, in August 1792 had said they could ap-

Ply with no effect to parliament, had no idea !
of si

uch a National Convention in England as
that National Convention in France which
they were addressing, and from which
they were expecting to receive addresses?
Am I to be told that they had no idea of such
& convention, as should overturn the con-
stitution of this country? It is impossible to
put sucha construction uponsuch proceedings.
Gentlemen, you will likewise nd that the
president of the Convention thought it neces-
sary to give an answer to this address. I will

state the substance of it: it will be read in |

evidence: therefore I shall not take up time
in looking for it. The president considering
them as generous republicans (and well he
might after what had passed), makes an ad-
dress to them, expressing much the same sen-
timents as those 1n which they had addressed
him, and then he concludes by saying—
“Without doubt the time approaches when
we shall soon send congratulations to the Na-
tional Convention of England.”

Gentlemen, you will likewise find that the
London Corresponding Society, and the Con-
stitutional Society, endeavoured to excite
persons in all parts of this kingdom to send
these addresses ; that in point of fact, there
are various other addresses sent, of similar
import, at the instigation of these societies,
and the intent of them, I think, cannot pos-
sibly be-misunderstood: but take the intent
of them to be what you will, let my learned
friend tell you, as he will, that there as yet


was no war between Great Britain and France>
you will allow me to say that there is evidence
ofa distinct intent that there should be a Na-
tional Convention in England, and thet the
French soldiers of liberty should assist what
they would call the soldiers of our liberty,
whether there should be a war between Great
Britain and France, or not: and vou will allow
me to say, that in that very month of No-
vember 1792, a passage occurs, in which
France does in effect declare war against ail
nations that did not adopt her principles, and
allow the people to put them into execution.

In a conspiracy, as widely extended as this
is, I shall undoubtedly insist, before you and
the Court, that the acts of individuals, and
particularly the acts of persons sent to present
addresses to a foreign country, that what they
doin reference to these acts is evidence against
all ofthem; and likewise that letters which
the persons write relative to the same ad-
dresses, are evidence against each of them
whether written by the particular individual
or no, as being in the prosecution of the same
purpose. Upon the 20th of September 1792,
Mr. Frost, who was then at Paris, states his
Notions in a letter to Mr. Tooke, of the rca!
effect of this transaction of the 1uth of August
1792, about which time Mr. Paine made his
first appearance in the National Convention
—“ Without the affuir of the 10th of August
liberty was over—We dine to-day with Petion
—Paine has entered his name on the roll of
parliament, and went through the forms of
office with a great deal of nonchalance—We
are well ludged, and beside our bed-rooms,
have an entertaining room for members to be
shown into, and several have called upon us
this morning.”

Then you will find, that there being a pro-
ject to send shoes to the soldiers of France,
and arms and muskets, with respect to
which project the prisoner was a contributor
—for the purpose of having this present trom
England to France properly distributed in
France, the fullowing letter is written to the
mayor of Paris:

“ Sir ;—You are in no want of friends in
England, who ardently wish to be useful tu
French liberty; but we wish to know some
one of your friends who resides in London, in
whow you have af entire confidence, and to
whom we may give Our money, in the assur-
ance that it will be remitted to you withont
delay, and without fraud. Mr, Frost to whom
T entrust this letter, 18 going to set out imme
diately with Mr. Paine for Paris, and aliows
me ne time for ceremony, if it were neces-
sary. I request you to scnd me the name of
some Frenchman in London, merchant, or
other, for the purpose above mentioned. We
can now begin the public contribution to-
wards our patriotic gift with a -thousard
pounds sterling, and I have no doubt’ but it
will amount in time to several thousands;
if you consider this step in the same point
of view that we do, you. will see in it much


tuse to the common cause in England and ! by no means such as were cakulated in any

France. 1 entreat you to give me your senti-
frents upon the subject, and to point out to
me the means by which I may be useful to
* »

This is answered, upon the 1st of October,
by Petion,; thus—“ You cannot, sir, doubt of
my eagerness to second views so useful, which
will for evec merit our gratitude, will zivet the
links of fraternity between us, and must
duce the greatest advantages to England and
France.
sending you without delay, the name of the
person in whose hands you may place the funds
whieh you destine to the support of a cause
which, in truth, is that of all people who che-
rish liberty.” -

Gentlemen, it may be iti the recollection of
perhaps most who now hear me, that circum-
stances of this sort, which were supposed to
be in existence, but, which, in fact, were not
capable of being proved to be in existence,
had excited in this country considerable alarm
in the minds of many persons who live in it.
+This alarm, it seems to have been thought
necessary, both in the Constitutional Society,
and-also in the London Corresponding So-
ciety, in some degree to lay asleep, as far as it
affected them; they thought it necessary,
therefore, to give some declaration, as they
call it, of their principles, and I will state to
you shortly what that was—but the explana-
tion, which the London Corresponding Society
gave, was thought so little safe, though it was
given for the purpose of laying asleep alarms,
that it will be distinctly proved to you—that
being written as I am instructed to state to
you (and I do it because I am instructed,
and it is my duty), ps Rec by Mr.
Vaughan, it was agreed to be stuck up round
the town at midnight—that aceordingly a
person of the name of Carter, a billsticker,
was employed for that purpose ; — that
sonte tnistake happened betweerhim and his
employers; that having made that mistake,
he was not thought a proper person to be
émployed in considerable business in the so-
ciety afterwards: this mn was taken up
in the act of sticking the bills round this
town, whieh contains this address—he was
prosecuted—he was convicted—and lay six
montha in a gaol in consequence of that con-
viction ; and this was the fate that attended
the issuing into the world an address, which
was to appear not originally by daylight, but
by midnight.

With respect to the address of the Consti-
tutional Society, I think I shall not be thought
to make an unfair observation upon it when I
say this—that if I had not read to you what I
have already read, you would have found it
impossible to say what it was, upon reading
that paper that they meant to say, who pub-
lished it; but after what I have read to you
T think you can have no difficulty to deter-
mine that the paper they published, and the

paper of the Corresponding Society, were


I shall have the honour, sir, of |

manner to disavow those principles, which I
think I have shown you satisfactorily, from
March 1792, were the principles they acted
upon and adopted.

Gentlemen, the address of the London
Corresponding Society is in these words —
“ Friends and fellow-countrymen, unless we:
are greatly deceived, the time is approaching
when the object for which we struggle is
likely to come within our reach, That a na-
tion, like Britons, should be free, it is requix
site only that Britons should will it, to become
so”’—that is a passage borrowed trom Mf.
Paine—“ that such should be their will—the
abuses of our original constitution, and the
alarms of our aristocratic enemies, sufficiently
witness: confident in the pony of our mo-
tives, and in the jastice of our cause, let us
meet falsehood with proofs, and hypocrisy
with plainness ; let us persevere in declaring
our principles, and misrepresentation will nicet
its due reward—contempt. . :

« In this view the artifices Of a late aristo-
cratic association, formed on the 20th instant
call for a few remarks on account of the decla-
rations they have published, relative to other
clubs and societies formed in this nation. It
is true that this meeting of gentlemen (for
so they style themselves) have mentioned no
names, instanced no facts, quoted no authori-
ties” ~ it was a little difficult to do it, unless

‘they had the means of seeing all the corres-

pondences at home and abroad but they
take upon themselves to assert that bodies of
their countrymen have been associated, pro-
fessing opinions favourable to the rights of
man, to liberty and equality’—mark these ex-
pressions—“ and moreover that these opinions
are conveyed in the terms, no king, no parlia~
ment.”

Gentlemen, what I have been endeavouring
to state to you is this, that it is necessarily
to be inferred from their principles that they
did mean to assert, when they were ripe for it,
no king, no parliament: it is pot my imputa- .
tion—I do not know whose it was, to which
this alludes, that they did express their opi-
nion in the language, no king, no parliament 5
but I say that they expressed their opinions
in lan e, whieh, when accutately looked af,
as forcibly import the ideas, as if they had
used the wine no king, no parliament—“ if
this be intended to include the societies to
which we respectively belong, we here, in
the most solemn manner, deny the latter
of the charge.”—What is the latter part of the
charge? that they do not mean to have a king
or parliament? No—but that the opinions
are conveyed in the terms, no king, no parlia~
ment.—Whoever shall attribute to us the ex~
penne of no king, no parliament, or any _

lesign of invading the property of other meng
is guilty of a wilful, an ayeuilenk, and a ma-
licious Lisehood”-—and then this paper, stating
a great deal- more, which, in justice to the
paper itself, shall be read ta you, concludes

x

-thus—“ Lét us wait and watch the ensuing
session of parliament, from whom we have
much to hope and little to fear. The House
of Commons may have been the source of our
calamity, it may prove that of our deliver-
ance; should it not, we trust we shall not
prove unworthy of our forefathers, whose ex-
ertions in the cause of mankind so well deserve
our imitation.”

Now, gentlemen, I ask, after concluding
this letter, what this means—“ if parliament
should not do it.”-—-If we are ready to admit
that parliament is formed upon principles that
make it competent to do the thing, if it please
to do it, it is all well; but if it will not, then
we will not prove unworthy of our forefathers,
whose exertions in the cause of mankind so
well deserve our imitation—and referring you
back te the coeeeapemdts between the Nor-
wich and the London Corresponding Society,
to the declaration of the 6th of August 1792,
which said they had nothing to look for from
parliament—to the correspondence with the
National Convention of France—to the con-
duct, which in the presence of their delegates,
was permitted—and never repudiated by any
act-of the London Corresponding Society; and
referring you, moreover, to the subsequent
evidence, which I have to offer to you; I
think you will find that the sentiment which
is expressed by the author of this paper, upon
the 19th of November 1792, was a sentiment
which, if followed up by those who continue

_ to hold it, meant that, if parliament did not

“give them redress, they would have it by their
own force.

With respect to the Constitutional Society,
all it thinks proper to say upon the subject is
this :—“ that the object of this society, from

its first institution to the present moment of
alarm, has uniformly been, to promote the
welfare of the people’—I_ beg your attention
to these words—“ has uniformly been to pro-
mote the welfare of the people by all consti-
tutional means.”—Now if I were to stop here,
with a view to show yeu what you are to un-
derstand by the words,—* all constitutional
means”—are the means I have been stating
<unstitutional means? Will it make the
means more constitutional than they really
are, because thpy choose to call them so?—
“ and to expose in their true light the abuses
which have imperceptibly crept in, and at last
grown to such a height, as to raise the most
serious apprehensions in every true friend of
the constitution.

“Resolved, ¢dly—That this society disclaims
the idea of wishing toeffecta change in the pe
sent system of things by violence and public
commotion, but that it trusts to the good sense
of the people”—You will find, before I have
done, that, in April 1793, it could not trust to
the sense of the people— when they
ehall be fully enlightened on the subject to

wre, without disturbing the public tran-
quillity, an effectual and permanent reform.
~ ™ Resolved, Sdly—That the intentions of


this and similar societies have of late been
grossly calumniated by those who are inte-
rested to perpetuate abuses, and their agents,
who have been industrious to represent the
members of such societies, as men of dangers
ous principles, wishing to destroy all social
order, disturb the state of property, and intro-
duce anarchy and confusion instead of regular
government.

“ Resolved, 4thly—That, in order to-coun-
teract the operation of such gross aspersions,
and to prevent them from checking the pro-
ere of liberal inquiry, it is at this time peco-

iarly expedient that this and similar societies
should publicly assert the rectitude of their
prineiples,

“ Resolved—That the said resolutions be
adopted, in order for printing in the news

rs.”

ow I desire any person to read that paper
through again, a hen, gentlemen of the
jury, if it is relied upon, be 30 good as to ask
yourselves what is the definite meaning in
any one passage in it.

About the same time there is an address
from the Manchester Socicty, dated the 14th
of Decemher 1792, which appears to have
been read in the Constitutional Society, in the
presence of the prisoner, and which address

some very particular circumstances about
it, for you will find that there was a resohution
upon the 14th of December 1792, in these
words—“ Read a printed address from Man-
chester—Resolved, that the said address be
approved for publishing in the Hemapapers”

It appears by a paper, which I shall produce
to you, that the words Read a printed address
from Manchester, are in the hand-writing of
Mr. Tooke; that the address itself is in the
hand-writing of Mr. Tooke; whether it was
a copy of any address at Manchester or not, I
do not know : this address appears a!
to be in print; it is seut for publication; and
with a view ¢o show to the public what extent
the Sstniba on of here has arisen to Aan the
progress of a treasonable purpose
this address was ordered ta be printed, and
that a hundred thousand copies of it should
be distributed to their correspondents in Great
Britain and Ireland.—The report that was
made upon it was, that it had been offered to
the Morning Chronicle the Morning Post,
and that the paper itself, though drawn by a
masterly hand, was such, that they durst not
venture to print it—TI believe it was however
printed in London. Yourwill occasionally see
5 pa printed in the country, at Manchester,
if London will not do it; or if the law of Eng-
land has reached as far as this side of the
Tweed, so as to check the publication of o
libel, then it is carried over the Tweed, in
order to be published in Scotland, where. it
might be more safely done.

Now, in this paper, which bears date wpon
the 14th of December 1792, and recollecting,
as I hope you will do, what I have ly
stated to you of the principles of those who
 925]
were concerned in this transaction, as these
principles had been manifested in all the other
transactions, I have stated to you, you will
find there is this passage: he says— To gull
the poor witb the insolent falsehood, that the
laws are the same for the poor as the rich, or
with idle panegyrics on a rotten constitution,
which you have not examined, and of whicb
you feel not the benefit—The real friends of
the people hear with pity and bear with pati-
ence the hourly calumnies to which they are
exposed ; they entertain, however, no personal
enmities, no aversion, but to the enemies of
the people, and no disrespect to the constitu-
tion, but where it is hostile to the rights of
the people.”
Now, why it is said to be hostile to the
tights of the people, I think, can be pretty
well understood, after what I have stated to
ou about these communications with France,


t it need not be left there, for you will find
that this is more distinctly stated in the
draught of an answer toa letter, which was
likewise read and entered.among the minutes
of this society upon the 6th of October 1792:
the draught of the answer scems to have been
prepared on the 2nd November 1792 ; it was
to be sent to the editors of the Patriot. The
editors of the Patriot were persons who were
living at Sheffield; and it will appear by the

rs,the substance of which I have not really

ily strength enough to state to you, were
affiliated at the same time with the London
Corresponding Society, aud also with the Con-
stitutional Socicty, in the propagation of their
paces and this in an extent, which no
j|anguage can do justice to, which it is impos-
able to describe to you without reading a par-
ticular letter, in which they themselves state
their mode of procceding, and which, for the
purpose of informing you in this respect,
shall be presently read to you: to one-of
them the following is an answer, and I beg
your attention to it, of the 2nd of Nov. 1792.

“ We rejoice with you in the increase of the
members of the societies of freedom ; our bo-
soms glow with the sentiments—we are bro-
thers in affection with you, and with the free-
men of Stockport’—(who wrate that letter
which I before observed upon, which states
that nothing can do but a convention, and that
their object is a government immediately
constituted by the people: that that cannot
be while the Crown or the Lords, as you
choose to cunstrue the letter, retain their au-
thority)—They add—*“ Freedom, though an
infant, makes “ Herculean efforts”—Now they
Meant nothing in the world to the prejudice of
the monarchy, they meant nothing in the world
but a full representation of the ree inaparlia-
ment co-existing with king and lords. They add
~—“ The vipers, aristocracy,” that is, persons
who have got coats upon their backs—“ and
Monarchy”—we have it yet in England,
gentlemen—“ are panting and writhin
Wnder its grasp: may success, peace, ani
happiness attend those efforts!” — That


letter, so prepared, will be produced to you,
with the corrections of Mr. Horne Tooke, in
his own hand.

Gentlemen, I have now gone through, as
well as I am able,—and I hope you will keep
in view the case I have stated,—the princi-
ples and practices of these societies, with all
their affiliations. I ought to mention to you,
that you will find ia the evidence, as itis laid
efore you, most uncommon industry in pick-
ing up fresh connexions. If a paper appeared
in the country, stating that a socicty of any
sort was formed, you will find immediate in-
dustry to connect them, and affiliate them
with the London Corresponding and Consti-
tutional Societies. If these societies professed
—as, for instance, the Stockport Society pro-
fessed—that they would have nothing but a
government constituted immediately by them-
selves, they contrive to give an answer satis-
factory to them. If the societies professed
attachment to the monarchy, and desired ex-
planation whether they meant Mr. Pitt's plan,
which Mr. Paine laughs at—-or whether they
meant the duke of Richmend’s plan—or
whether they meant, as a letter, you will
hear by and by, says, to rip up monarchy by
the roots, you will find they satisfied them all
sufficiently to enlist them all for that purpose,
which from their own transactions, I state to
be neither more nor less, than to do what
Mr. Paine did in his book, to combine the
principles, which they stated, when the
times were ripe for it, with the practices
which were correspondent with those princi-
ples; to apply those principles, which were
alike the principles of these societies and of
the French constitution of 1791, and which
Mr. Paine, Mr. Barlow, and those addressers
to the convenion, receiving such answers from
the convention in 1792, declared bad produced
a constitution in France upon the 10th of Au-
gust 1792, to apply them not to form that,
which in its nature is an absurdity, a royal de-
mocracy, but that which upon principle is
consistent, though it ita wretched bad govern-
Ment, a representative government, to be ex-
changed here in lieu of our limited monarchy,
in lieu of our government, under which I
state it, with a defiance to the world to tell
me that I do not state it truly, that a people
never did enjoy, since the providence of God
made us a people (you may talk about theories
as you please), that they never did enjoy, for
so long atime together, such a quantum of
actual private happiness and private prosper-
ity, public happiness and public prosperity,
under any constitution, as we have enjoyed
under the constitution, to the destruction or
the support of which it is for you to judge
whether such means, as I have been stating
to you, were designed to be esuployed.

‘The next thing that was to be done, was to
go on in strengthening themselves by affilia-
tion ; and you will fin eager that they
have connexions at Norwich, Shefheld, Leeds,
and other places: indeed, there was hardly a

county, in which they had not affiliated so-
cietics, and, if you believe them, to great
numbers. , ,
The next step they took was, not that they
should have it accomplished—their principles
would not let them accomplish it—but it was
for the purpose of attaching more and more
affiliated societies, that they began now to
think, in the year 1793, of making applica-
“tions to parliament. Gentlemen, mn the
course of that year, 1793, whilst they are to
make applications to parliament, you will find
that they distinctly discuss the utility of doing
so. The London Corresponding Society, it
will be proved to you, take the opinion of the
socicties in the country with respect to three
distinct propositions. Mark this.
Now, gentlemen, in September 1792, the
Stockport Society told the London Corres-
ponding Society that there was no hope of
doing any thing but in a convention; the
London Corresponding Society give the an-
swer that I have before stated. They began
to think of this thing called a conven-
tion in the beginnir.g of the year 1793, and
they propose having communication, on the
other hand, from the country societies. They
State three propositions—W hat is it we are to
do ?— Are we to make an application to parlia-
ment ?—Are we to make an application to the
king ?—That would have been, to make ap-
Plication to the king, that he would be
gra ious'y pleased, according to the oath which
be takes upon his coronation, to give his con-
sent to measures, which were to destroy the
government of the country, as it exists, and
of himself as a part of it! Or are we to have
a convention? You will find, when the
whole of the evidence is laid before you,
there is a vast deal of discussion about this
measure of a convention, there is a vast deal
of discussion about applying to parliament.
The application to the king is thought futile
without more debate; but they come to this
Metermination, that things are not yet ripe:
but that the application to parliament, how-
ever, may be one means of ripening that
which is not yet mature; and then solicitin
petitions from all parts of the kingdom, tell-
ing those, from whom they ‘ask them, that
they do not mean that they should have any
effect, that they are all waste paper; canvas-

sing all parts of the kingdom, and getting sig- |

Matures in the way you will find, they
send the petitions to parliament, which, for

myself and my posterity, I thank God par-.

liament did not attend to; I mean petitions to
introduce a change in the government upon
the principle of annual suffrage and universal
Tepresentation.

They determined for the present that they
would content themselves with petitions:
that this would occasion a great deal of de-
bate: that that would give them a vast variety
of opportunities of discussing the point they
had had in agitation since 1792; and, if the
public mind was not ripe for a convention in


1798, the proceedings and transactions of
1793, had a natural and obvious tendency,
when these transactions were made a proper
use of, to bring to maturity the project, not
yet Come to maturity: you will find therefore
that both the London maneeyning Eee
and the Society for Constitutional Informa-
tion keep this object in view.

The Norwich Society, upon the 5th of
March 1793, write thus to the Society for
Constitutional Information, and which you
will see had held correspondence also with
the London Corresponding Society upon.the
subject of the same proposition : “ It is with
peculiar satisfaction that we are favoured with
your correspondence,”—they first ssy—“ We
wish to find out a method of redress; at pre-
sent we see a great propriety in universal suf-
frage and annual elections; but we beg
will be obliging enough to inform us of wl
you have collected of the sense of the people
by your correspondence: we have to inform
you that our worthy Corresponding Societies
of London have recently submitted three pro-
positions for our investigation ; first, whether
a petition to parliament, or an address to the
king, or a convention.”

When I find here the word convention, I
think I may address this question to you as
nen of common sense; if, in August 1792,
the London Corresponding Society, by the
address which I have read to you, have told
you distinetly that they cannot get any redress
from parliament, is it not marvellous how it
is to be made out in argument, that, in March
1793, they were to have a convention in ordet
to get it from parliament, and more i
larly to get it from that parliament, which,
upon their owp principles was not tent
to give it, if they had a mind to take it from
parliament?

* Permit us briefly to state our views for
your revisal ; and with respect to the first, we
behold we are a conquered people; we have
tamely submitted to the galling yeke, and
resistance in the present circumstances is vain;
we cannot, we cannot act the man; and, 88
necessity has no law, we think ourselves un-
der that degrading necessity to state our grie-
vances to the House of Commons, with a re-
quest for redress; and should they refuse”—
which they did—* to grant our reasonable
petition, we have still got (no thanks to
them)”—here is an accurate, a short descrij
tion of the affiliated societies—“ a formidab!
engine, that will couvey the insult to the
remotest parts of the kingdom: as to the
propriety of the second, we wish to submit to
your superior judgment, and should esteem it
a favour to be informed of the result; fer at
Present we are dubious of its good conse-

uences. Lastly, a cunvention ; and oh! that
the period were arrived; but in the present
state of affairs, alas! it is impracticable ; yet
: this is the object we pursue, and esteem any

other means only in subordination to, and as

having a tendency to accomplish that

able end.


“ We wish to be in unison with. our bre-
ahren and fellow labvurers, and should be glad
of any information, as soon as it is conveni-
ent; and we beg your advice whether it is
necessary, as soon as possible, to collect sig-
natures to a petition for a real representation
of the people #”

This letter, of the 5th of March 1793, hav-
ing been received from Norwich, you will
find that Mr. Frost, who had then lately come
from France, and was about that time, I be-
lieve, talking of no king in this country, in
which it is not yet quite lawful to say so, was
thought an extremely proper pergon to draw
up a letter in answer to this; and accordingly
it is stated upon the books of the society, that
Mr. Frost was ordered to prepare that answer:
however, it got into abler- hands; for, unless
i am again misinstructed, it was settled by
counsel, and the substance I will now read to
you. It is dated the 16th of April 1793.
* From the seeretary of the Society for Con-
stitutional Information to the secretary of the
United Political Societies at Norwich.—We
have to acknowledge with great satisfaction
the letter which you favoured us with, dated
the 5th instant, relative to the most desirable
of all other objects, the reform of a parlia-
meentary representation. The honour you do
us in supposing that we are better fitted than

ourselves for the promotion of political
know iadees we must disclaim, because we
observe with the test pleasure, that our
country correspondents have too much zeal
and information to want success in their pub-
lic endeavours, whether at Norwich, at Shef-
field, at Manchester, or elsewhere, through-
out the nation. In our sincerity for the good
of our country we trust that we are all equal,
and, as such, we doubt not of our ultimate
success.
- “ We see with sorrow the existence of those
evils, which you so justly represent as the
streams of corruption overflowing this once
free and prosperous country. We see with
surprise and abhorrence that men are to be
found, both able and willing to support those
corruptions. It is, however, no small conso-
lation to find that others are not wanting, in
every point of the nation, of an opposite cha-
racter, who are ready to remedy, by all laud-
able and honourable means, the defect in our
Yepresentation, the usurped extension of the
duration of parliaments, and other grievances
_Such as you notice in your letter.

“ That the constitution of England has no
more of that character it once possessed ;
that the supposed democracy of the country
has become a matter of property and privi-
lege ; and that we have therefore no longer
that mixed government, which our adversa-
Ties are praising, when they know it is no
longer in our possession, are facts notorious
and indisputable: where then are we to look
for remedy ?”—most assuredly those who had
said on the 6th of August, 1792, they would
not louk to parliament, would not be so in-


consistent as to say that they would look to
it in April 1793—“ to that parliament of
which we complain? to the executive power
which is implicitly obeyed, if not anticipated
in that parliament? or to ourselves ?”

Now, who are ourselves? why, those affi-
liated societies! “ ourselves represented in
some meeting of delegates for the extensive
purpose of reform, which-we suppose you un-
derstand by the term convention.” The Nor-
wich Society writes to the Constitutional So-
ciety, and it proposes a convention as the
only means of doing this business. The
Constitutional Society states that it is to be
done only in a convention,—of what? of
themsclves. Why then, I say, upon the 16th
of April, 1798, the Constitutional Society
construed the acts of the 20th of January,
1794, which I shall allude to presently, and
the 27th of March, 1794, because the Consti-
tutional Society, said that a convention was a
convention of themselves, represented in some
meeting of delegates,—and for what purpose ?
for the extensive purposes of reform ;—how ?
byapplyingtoparliament? No. Why, thispas-
sage states expressly that the reason why they
would have a convention was, because they
would not apply to parliament; and can [
impute to men of understanding, that are
employed in this business, for there ere merf
of understanding enough employed in this
business; whether that understanding is.
properly employed in this business, it is not
for me to say any thing about—can I impute
any thing so absurd to men of understanding
as that they meant to form a convention,
which convention should carry their petition
to parliament?

“Tt is the end of each of these proposi-
tions that we ought to look to; and, as suc-
cess in a good cause must be the effect of
perseverance and the rising reason of the
time, let us determine with coolness, but Ict
us persevere with decision. As to a conven-
tion, we regard it as a plan the most desirable
and most practicable ;”—when? so soon as
the great body of the people shall be virtuous
enough to joinusin the attempt? No—but “so
soon as the great hody of the people shall be
courageous and virtuous enough to join usin the
attempt.” You will see whether the interpre-
tation which I give of the word “ courageous”
by the manner in which I mean to expressit, is
due to it or not, by what I have to state to you.

Gentlemen of the jury, with a view to ex-
plain this thing called a convention, as con-
tradistinguished from parliament, give me
leave to carry back, your attention for a mo-
ment to January 25, 1793. In this society,
which, in November, 1792, had the corres-
pondence with France, which I stated, in Ja-
nuary, 1793, when we were on the eve ofa
war, and upon the eve of a war which had
been produced by the “principles which
brought fraternization into’ this, country,
and took place soon after that decree of

November,. 1792, you will find that these re-

solutions were come to-—‘ That citizen St.
André, a member of the National Convention
of France,”—that convention which had de-
posed a king, as that which could not exist ina
government, formed upon the principles of the
rights of man, as disclosed by Mr. Paine, his
fellow-member in that convention,—“ as one
of the most judicious and enlightened friends
of human liberty, be admitted an associated

honorary member of this society.—Resolved |

That citizen Barrére, a member of the Na-
tional Convention of France, being considered
by us as one of the most judicious and en-
lighteaed friends of human hans be ad-
mitted an associated honorary member of this
society. -

“ Resolved, that citizen Roland, being also
considered by us as one of the most judicious
and enlightened friends of human liberty, be
admitted an associated honorary member.

“ That the speeches”—Gentlemen, I par-
ticularly request your attention to this—
* that the speeches of citizen St. André and
citizen Barrére, associated honorary members
of this society, as given in the Gazette Na-
tionale, ou Moniteur universel of Paris, on
the 4th, 6th, and 7th of January, 1793, be
inserted in the books of this society ;”—and,
as far as this society could effectuate it, they
endeavoured also to have these resolutions,

lished in the newspapers, and it will be
1n proof to you that, in the books of the so-
ciety, it is resolved that each of these resolu-
tions should be so published.

Now, gentlemen, I shall prove to you, by
evidence completely effectual for that pur-
pose, what these speeches were, and then, if
you will be so good as to ask yourselves what
the Constitutional Society, which in January
and February ordered these speeches to be
published, meant by a convention in that let-
ter of the 16th of April, 1793, you will judge
whether that convention was to be the means
Vege they would neither apply to the

ing, the executive power, nor to the parlia-
ment), was to be the means of handing
their application to parliament or whether,
on the other hand, it was to be the means
of introducing by its own force, a re-
.presentative procrmnent in this country?
that assembly, which you will find, they
insist would for the time absorb all the
powers of government, which, if it did
exist, would delegate its legislative power
only so long as they chose to delegate it, a
body competent to create a legislature, and
possessing within itself an eternal power of
reform, an eternal source of revolution.
With respect to St. André, speaking to the
convention, he says, “ Your right to decide
the fate of kings arises from your being a re-
volutionary assembly created by the nation”
—a- revolutionary assembly created by the
nation in such a state is at least that thin
which I think no good Englishman ever wil
wish to exist to see—“ a revolutionary as-
sembly, created by the nation in a state of
insurrection.”


[332

Speaking of the trial of the king of France,
mee This proceeding is of the highest
importance to public order, absolutely neces-
sary to the existence of liberty, aud connected
with whatever is held most sacred by the
nation.

“The people of Paris”—This is upon the
question whether the person of the king be
ioviolable, a maxim unquestionably true ia
the constitution of this country, a maxiot
perfectly consistent with the civil liberties of
the people, because, though the king’s per-
son is inviolable, he has advisers, who are
violable as to every act that he does—* The
people of Paris, by making a boly insurrec-
tion against the king on the 10th of Angie ”
—that 10th of August, which, in Mr. t's
letter to Mr. Tooke, was absolutely necessary
to the existence of liberty in France—“ de-
igs him of his character of inviolability.

he people of the other departments, ap-
plauded this insurrection, and adopted the
consequence of it. The people have therefore
formally interposed to destroy this royal in-
violability. The tacit consent of the Lk
rendered the person of the king inviolable;
the act of insurrection”—I pry heaven de-
fend us from the operation of such principles
in this country—“ the act of insurzection was
a tacit repeal of that consent, and was
founded on the same grounds of law as the
consent itself; the king’s person is inviolable
only with relation to the other branches of
the legislature, but not with relation to the
people.”

Now, I ask, what did those gentlemen,
who ordered this speech to be published,
that the king’s person is inviolable only with
relation to the other branches of the legisla
ture, when they were talking of conventions,
mean? Iam sorry to say that my mind is
drawn to the conclusion that they thought
the king’s person was not inviolable with ree
lation to the people, a convention of whons
was to be formed, and was to be formed be-
cause an application to parliament was
useless.

Now, let us see the description of a con-
vention. “ A convention differs from an ot
dinary legislature in this respect: a legisla
ture is only a species of superintending ma-
gistracy,a moderator of the powers of govern-
ment: a convention is a perfect representation
of the sovereign: the members of the legisla-
tiveassembly acted in August upon these prin-
ciples, in sammoning the conyention; they
declare”—precisely as it is declared in the
letter I have been reading to you—* that
they saw but one measure which could seye
France, namely, to have recourse to the su-
preme will of the people, and to invite the
yee to exercise immediately that upaliena-

le right of sovereignty, which: the constitu:
tion had acknowledged, and which it could
not subject to any restriction: the public in-
terest required that the people should ma-
nifest their will by the election of a Nasional

Convention, formed of representatives in+
vested by the people with unlimited powers.
The people did manifest their will by the
election of that convention. The convention
being assembled is itself that sovereign will
which ought to prevail. It would be con-
trary to every principle to suppose that the
convention js not alone exclusively the expres-
sion of the general will. i

“¢ The powers of the convention must, from
the very nature of the assembly, be unlimited
with respect to every measure of general
safety, such as the execution of a tyrant. It
is no longer a convention, if it has not power
to judge the king: a convention is a constituent
body, i. e. a body that is to make a constitu-
tion ior the people; a legislature makes laws

ler an established constitution, and in con-
formity to it. It is despotism when, in the
ordinary and permanent establishment ofa
state, there is no separation of powers ; but
it is of the very essence of a constituent body
to concentre ‘be the time all authority: it is
the very nature of a national convention, to
be the tempo image of the nation, to
unite in itself all the powers of the state, to
saploy them against the enemies of liberty,
and to distribute them in a new social com-
pact called a constitution.”

Gentlemen, after I have stated that to you,
I think I cannot possibly be mistaken when I
conceive that you can do no otherwise than
put the same construction upon this letter
which I did.

I will now take the liberty of calling your
attention to a letter of the 17th of May 1793,
and the answer of the 26th May 1793, passing
over a tt many letters, the substance of
which you will inform yourselves of by having

read, namely, letters that prove affilia-
tions solicited and granted to Leeds, Tewkes-
bury, Coventry, and many places in the
kingdom, more numerous than I apprehend
bt will believe, till you see what the num-
of them is, by evidence actually before

Re

ou.

Gentlemen, I beg leave now to call your
attention, in order of time, to a letter of the
17th May 1793, for it begins a correspondence
Most excessively material with that part of
country in which the convention has been
already held ; I mean Scotland ;—a convention
which, I think I shall satisfy you, did, for the
time, act upon the principles that I have
stated to you, from the speech of Barrére, as
far as it could act, and in which I think, at
the moment that I address you, if it had not
been stopped in the execution of its purposes,
and had been joined by those whose acts we
are considering this day, you might have seen,
in the speeches of a national convention in
Great Britain, a repetition of the language of
Barrere, instead of hearing it from me in a

court of justice.
Gentlemen, I hold it, in the office that I
‘fill, to be due to the administration of the jus-

Uce of this country, to say distinctly, if 1 un- i


derstand the case upon which certain per-
sons were tried for the acts which they did in
Scotland, that, if they had been tried tor high
treason, they would have no right to com-
plain; no right to complain if the question
upon their conduct had been agitated in that
shape before a jury of the Sout
Gentlemen, upon the 17th of May, a Mr,
Urquhart going from London, Mr. Hardy, and
a Persea of the name of Margarot, celebrat-
ed in the future history of this business, join,
and write a letter—parliament had, as the
expected it would, and as they meant it should,
rejected their petition—“The London Cor.
responding Society eagerly seizes the oppor-
tunity of Mr. Urquhart going back to Edin-
burgh, to request of your society a renewal of
correspondence, and a more intimate co-ope-
ration in that which both societies alike seck,
viz. a reform in the parliamentary representa~
tion. We are very sensible that no society
can by itself bring about that desirable end :

let us, therefore, unite as much as possible,
not only with each other, but with every
other society throughout the nation. Our

petitions, you will have learned, have bean

all of them unsuccessful: our attention must

now, therefore, be turned to some more effec-

tual means; from your suciely we would wil. -
lingly learn them, and you, on your part, may

depend upon our adopting the firmest mea-

sures, provided they are constitutional, and we

hope the country will not be behindhand with

us. ”

Now, by “constitutional measures,” it is
clear that they meant that a convention, as
contradistinguished from a parliament, would
be constitutional: it is clear they meant it,
because they have said it.

Then Mr. Skirving ® writes thus — “ Mr,
Urquhart did me the pleasure to call on
Thursday afternoon, and delivered your letter
of the 17th inst. I am much pleased with
the contents of it, and shall lay it before the
first meeting of our societies here, which, how-
ever, does not take place till Monday seven-
night. I would have acknowledged the receipt
of your favour by yesterday’s post, but was tou
much employed in removing our household
to another leising to attend to any thing
else.” NowI beg your attention to this, be-
cause you will see in the transactions of the

ople in convention in Edinburgh, that they

looked to what they were todo in case of a
rebellion as well as any other.

“Tfeither you in England or we in Scot-
land should attempt separately, the reform
which we, I trust, seek to obtain, we should,
by so doing, only expose our weakness, and
manifest our ignorance of the corruption
which opposes our important undertaking ; if
we sought only the extirpation of one set of
interested men from the management of na-
tional affairs, that place might be given to


another set; without affecting the vitals ad-
verse to the system of reform, these might be
easily accomplished: but to cut up deep and
wide rooted prejudices, to give effectual ener,
to the dictates of truth in favour of public
virtue and national prosperity, in opposition to
self and all its interested habits, and to with-
stand and overawe the final efforts of the
powers of darkness, is the work of the whole,
and not ofa part; a work to which mankind
till this awfu' poe were never adequate, be-
cause never till pow disposed to fraternize,
not merely or only, I trust, from the sense of
the common danger to which we are exposed,
but from the ennobling principle of universal
benevolence. .

“TI know no greater service that I can do
my country, than to promote the union you
so wisely desire: and I am happy to assure
you, that I have bitherto discovered no sen-
timent in our association, adverse to the most
intimate and brotherly union with the asso-
ciations in England.

“T think the minds of all must in the na-
ture of things be now turned to more effectual
soa of reform. Not one person was con-
vinced of the necessity of it by the most con-
vincing arguments of reason, together with
the most unequivocal expressions of universal
desire. What then is to be hoped for from
repetition? Iam only afraid that the bow in
England against reform was so contracted,
that in returning it may break. You would
willingly learn, you say, from us—I own that
we ought to be forward in this: we have at
once in great wisdom perfected our plan of
organization, and if we were in the same in-
dependent state of mind as the people of
pe we would be able to take the lead
——the associations with you are no more, I
fear—excuse my freedom—than an aristocracy
for the good of the people: they are indeed
moderate, firm, and virtuous, and better can-
not be; but we are the people themselves,
and we are the first to show that the people
can both Jute and resolve, if undirected by
faction, with both wisdom and moderation.

“T have not a higher wish in the present
exertions for reform than to see the people
universally and regularly associated, because
Tam persuaded that the present disastrous
engagements will issue in ruin, and the peo-
ple must then provide for themselves; and it
would be unhappy when we should be ready
to act with unanimity, to be occupied about
organization, without which, however, anar-
chy must ensue—we will not need but to be
prepared for the event—to stand still and see
the salvation of the Lord—let us therefore
take the hint given us by our opposers; let
us begin in earnest to make up our -minds re-
lative ig Pe extent of aber which r ought
to seek, be prepared to justify it, and to con-
trovert objections : let us model the whole in
the public mind; let us provide every stake
and stay of the tabernacle which we would
erect, so that when the tabernacles of oppres-


sion in the ‘palaces of ambition are brokea
down, under the madness and folly of their
supporters, we may then, without anarchy
aud all dangerous delay, erect at once our
tabernacle of righteousness, and may the Lord
himself be in it!”

Gentlemen, these are things all very easy
tobeunderstood. - .

“ How hurtful to the feelings of a reflect-
ing mind, to look back to the wretched state
in which the Roman monarchy, eafeebled and
broken by its own corruptions, left the nations,
which it subjected, like sheep without a shep-
herd; they soon became a prey to every in-
vader, because there was mone to gather and
unite them; had they, foreseeing the evil,
associated for mutual defence, -no robber
would have been able to enslave them ;
would have given laws to all parties, as
as to themselves: all separate colonies and
nations would have sought their alliance ; but
not having virtue to associate, and heal the
divisions, and root out the selfish spirit,
which ambition-fostering governments pro-
cure to their subjects, they fell under oppres-
sions, from under whose iron sceptre they
have never yet been able to deliver them-
selves.

“ We may suppose an event, which we
deprecate; nay, should we not be prepared for
every possible issue of the present unprecedent-

.ed divisions of- mankind, we have a right to

be apprehensive of the abilities of our own
managers, who are so afraid to depart from
recedent, that, like men of detail, they may
e inadequate to the task of preserving the
vessel from shipwreck, now grappling with
danger not only great, but new and uncom-
mon. If the present ministry fail, who after
them shall be trusted? It requires little pe-
Nnetration to see the anarchy and discord
which will follow; it will be such, teh
thing short of a general union ai
people themselves, will be able to heals baste
therefore to associate, at least to be to
associate; if, then, such a broken state of
things should take place, the civil broils that
ane necessarily ensue, would soon subside
before the united irresistible voice of the
whole. Do not, I entreat you, hesitate’
thinking such a work premature as yet,”—
this is written in May 1793 ;—* but a month,
and then it may be too late; a malignant
party may be already formed, and only
waiting for the halting of the present mena-
gers; it will then be too late to seek to sub-
ject to deliberation, after a party has dared
the act of rebellion. Jf you go po further
than separate meetings in different towns,
we will not be able to confide in yous con
fraternity, because while in such a state you
may be but the tools of a faction; we
have all confidence and unite with all affec-
tion in one assembly of commissioners from all
countries of the world.” . .
Gentlemen, observe that expressica ; this

letter, in the beginning of it, speaking with

reference to the war, does. not know but the
palaces of ambition may be all overset; the
illars will tumble with’ their supporters.
‘hen it says, “ we could have all confidence
and unite with all affection in one assembly
commissioners from all countries of the world
—if we knew they were chosen by the un-
biassed voice of the people, because they
would come up with the same disinterested
views and desires as ourselves, having all
to a common centre of union and
interest; but we could not confide in fellow-
citizens, who kept aloof from such union, and
‘would not previously affiliate in one great and
indivisible family.”

Gentlemen, I have befote told you, that
‘there was a society at Birmingham. Upon
the 10th of June 1793, the London Corres-
ponding Society writes to that Society in
these terms: “ it is with singular satisfaction
the Committee of the London Corresponding
Society received your letter; they are very
giad to see the spirit of freedom springing up
in Birmingham, and they make no doubt but
that the zeal of your Society and the increase
of your numbers will soon do away the
stigma thrown on your town by the unjus-
tifiable behaviour of a Church and King mob:
‘we are entirely of your opinion. with regard to
the necessity of a general union, and we be-
lieve, as you do, that when once the country

shall have so united,”—what then? “ the |

Neroes of the day will be forced to yield to
the an demand of a long and sore oppressed
”
entlemen, the political societies at Nor-
wich also write to the London Corresponding
Society with respect to this Convention upon
the 25th of June 1793, in which they say,
“ we also received your friendly letter prior
to that wherein you stated three propositions:
first, a petition to his majesty, or to parlia-
ament, or a national convention; and ordered
one of our committee to answer it ; should be
glad if you will inform me whether it was
attended to.’ I gave my opinion on the sub-
Ject to the Constitutional Society of London,
and found their ideas congenial to my own,”
—thatalludes to the letter they wrote him,—
® viz. an address to the king—futile; a peti-
tion to parliament (as a conquered people)—
tolerable; a national convention GE cruten-
stances admitted), best of all.”
‘Gentlemen, you will find that, upon the
28th of June 1793, whilst these societies
were holding so much correspondence with
y Tespect to thie national convention, as the
only effectual mcans, it was thought an ad-
dress to the nation should be prepared: that
is not immaterial, because you will find after-
wards, that the project of a national conven-
tion in Scotland was thought by many of the
members of it, and many of the members of
those bodies, to have failed for want of such
@ previous address to the nation; and upon

this occasion two gentlemen are brought.
together, I do not know whether one of them.


at that time was s member of the society or
not, but two members are brought together,
Mr. Horne Tooke and a borer of the name
of Yorke,* who, you will find, was a delegate

of | to the convention in Scotland, and who you

will find has acted a considerable
other parts of this country, were to
ployed in preparing that address.
~ Upon the 6th of July 1793, a letter havin;
been feceived from the political socintes de
Norwich, theanswer, signed by the prisoner
at the bar, is given in these terms': ~
“Fellow-citizens, the London Cotrespond-
ing Society have received, and: read with
pleasure, your letter of the 25th of Jane ;' bit
the answer, which you mention to‘have been
made to our three questions, has not by
come to hand; we shall be glad to be i -
formed by your next whether it was ever ‘put
in the post-office. i “ie 6
“With regard‘te the questions themselves,
however individuals may have made up thelr
mitids on them, the public seeincd most to
‘approve the mode of petitioning parliament.”
Then it states the effect oF the petitions,
‘“ Exhorting you therefore to throw aside all
unavailing complaint, we wish you to occupy
yourselves in instructing the people, in intrd-
ducing and maintaining order and regularifs
in your own society, and in forming a junctio’
with all others associated for the same put-
pose throughout the nation, by keeping up’a
constant correspondence with them; but,
above all, orderly and courageously preparin
yourself for the event,"~—now mark the event,—
“ for, as it is natural to suppose that those, who
now pe on the public, will not willingly yield
up their enjoyments, nor repossess us of our
rights without a struggle, which by their bé=
haviour in Ireland,”—that alludes to the bill
in Ireland to prevent a convention,—" we
| have some reason to think they are meditating,
and perhaps may intend to effect by means of
those Joreign mercenaries, who ure now
paid by the sweat of our brow, and whom, under
‘some plausible pretence, it would be no difficult

| pantageous to humanity to show them at first

but an indignant oppressed people, in wham is

e Gentlemen, in a letter to Hertford, which is
written by the same Correspending Society,
upon the Sist of July 1793, and which Socie'
at Hertford had desired to know their princt

manner ;—“ We receive with pleasure your

‘. In October 1798, the Scotch Convention
having met, of which we have all of us heard
‘80 Touch out of this place, you will find that a
etter had been received from a Mr. Sinclair,®
together with an address from Sirving who
.Was secretary to the Convention and Friends
of the People in Scotland, by the London
Constitutional Society; an extraordi

meeting of the Society was therefore called,
‘Bt the Crown and Anchor, to consider the

a convention of delegates. of the different
societies in Great Britain, at Edinburgh, for
the purpose of obtaining a parliamentary
reform. :

Upon the 28th of October 1798, this society
came to a resolution to send delegates to that
convention, and the two persons elected were
Mr. Sinclair and Mr. Yorke; and perhaps one
cannot state a more striking. instance of the
extraordinary power of a small society, aff-
lating itself with societies, spread all over the
whole kingdom, than by stating that Sinclair,
who was deputed from this society, meeti
with other delegates in Scotland, bad no di
culty of assuming with others the title of a
delegate to the British Convention—to assert
their right to do acts in contradiction to the
legislature—than by telling you, that this
Yorke and Sinclair were deputed from this
society by a poll, in which he, who had the
majority, had seventeen votes only; My.
Yorke and Mr. Sinclair are accordingly scot
down, and they go with all the delegation of
the power of the people, which this Constitu-
tional Society, thus affiliated, could give
them, and what they thought it was you will
see_presently.—The London Corresponding
Society was not to be backward in torming
this Convention in Scotland—and, accot-
dingly, you will see in the evidence, which I
have to state to you, a considerable deal of
contrivance on the part of the prisaner at the
bar, in order to bring about that convention
in Scotland; for, gentlemen, he writes «
letter to the ‘Norwich Constitutional Society,
which deserves your very serious attention,
in which he expresses himself thus—“ We
have to acknowledge, at once, your favours of
the Srd_of September and 14th instant;
utopia: of business prevented my answes-
ing your first, but will now inform you that
the spirit, shown in it, gave great satisfaction
to our society at large. The rejoicings for the
capture of Valenciennes were not confined to
Norwich alone: the ignorant every where else
throughout the nation betrayed their imbeci-
lity on the occasion—the taking of a town,
the slaughtering of thousands. of bumaa
beings, the laying waste whole provinces, or
the enslaving a nation (however great evils
they may be), can only retard for a small
‘space of time the progress of truth and
reason. Be not disheartened therefore; pursue
your plan, instruct mankind, and constitu-
tionally set your faces against existing abuses;
be assured that many are our friends, who
opportunity to openly
join us, while our cnemies have much en-
feebled themselves and their cause y their
arbitrary exertions; despotism is at its last

‘gasp—one or two caurpaigns more will ter-

minate its existence.
“We are glad to see that you ‘begin to
make a proper use of delegation; where

‘bodies of men are too numerous to be con-

vened easily on every occasion, delegation is

“the best, and indeed the only way to obtain
. s
the general opinion. Scotland, iniproving on
the idea, have ot only summoned their tw
delegates, but also invite those of every other
society to attend a kind of convention” (as if
Mr. Hardy knew nothing about it), “ which is
to be held at Edinburgh on the 29th instant
——the enclosed paper, which I, ‘previous to
the communicating your letter to our com-
mittee (which will meet only to-morrow),
make haste to tranemit to you, will show you
that your society is included in the general in-
vitation to send delegates to that peste
which we exhort you to do. if you possibly
can; I firmly believe our society will not miss
the opportunity of doing the same.”

‘Now you will find that, upon the 5th of
October 1793, Hardy, who wrote this letter
upon the 17th, wrote to Skirving in this way
2—“ With pleasure I peruse your favour of the
2ad instant, but, as yet, have scen nor heard
nothing ‘of the two copies’ of Mr. Muir’s*
trial, which you mention as being sent to the
society and to myself—be kind enough, not-
withstanding, to return that gentleman thanks
for his polite attention, and assure him that
we view him in the light of a martyr to free-
dom, as well as Mr. Palmer,+ and that our
warmest bh are, that the oppressors of
mankind will either be ashamed or afraid of
carrying their revengeful malice into execu-
tron

«~The General Convettion, which you men-
tion, appears to Mr. Margarot (to whom alone
E have communicated your letter) and myself
te be a very excellent measure, und as such, I
cordd wish you, without delay, to communicate it
officially to our society without any ways men-
traning thut have written to me prisutely—
if in your official letter you should sequire us
80 send a deputation to that meeting, I have
no doubt tut our society would, with pleasure,
accept the invitation ; and [ ain persuaded it
may do much good.—Our freedom, as you
justly observe, depends entirely upon our-
selves; and upon our availing ourselves of
this opportunity, which, once Jost, may not be
Becovered so soon. I am glad to discover by
your testimony that Iwas by no ways mis-
taken in the high opinion T always bad of
Jord Daer’s patriotism: a title may be a bar
te disinterested partriotism, but it seems he
has evinced it not to be an insuperable one.

© You are right; itis true, that we ‘have
hed another general meeting, at which a has-
tily composed and suddenly produced address
to the king was read, applauded, and
tobe presented ; but, on a cool revisal, the said
address being found to be more 1iPnabired om
spirited, more dengerous in its lan e, than
advantageous in its object, feaider being too
long, the committee, with the approbation of
the majority of the society, have adopted ano-
, much safer, more apposite, relating
solely to the war: enclosed you have a copy


%


of it; but-you was misinformed when you was,
told we passed any resolutions at that meeting,

for we only came to one, and that rather of a

private nature, namely, that the conduct of
sir James Sanderson, in preventing ‘the meet-
ing of the London’ Corresponding ‘Society, at.
the Globe tavern, Fleet street, was of such’
a nature s to place him below our censure.”

Gentlemen, the London Constitutional -So-
ciety gave their delegates, Mr. Yorke and Mr.
Sinclair, certain instructions: and I ought’
here to tell you, -by way of explaining the
effect of what { am now to state, that the’
manner of ‘keeping the books of the London
Constitutional Society, as I understand it, was
this—The resolutions, made upon one night,’
were taken upon loose minutes, either by the’
secretary, or by other persons, who acted in his _
absence, or in his presence, when he was not.
doing that duty himself: they were entered be-
fore the subsequent night of meeting, regularly.
in the book, and the first thing done upon the'
subsequent night of meeting was to read the’
resulutions which were made upon the former '
night, and to see that they were correct: now
it will naturally occur that the minutes may
explain the book, and the book may explain
the minutes: now, when they come to draw |
the minutes, which you will have for the in-
steuction of their delegates ata convention, |
which was to be held in Scotland, the first’
ided was, toinstruct those delegates,to petition
parliament; but they seem to have recollected
that that wasa measure, which had been’
abandoned some months before by all the so-
cieties with whom they were affiliated: they
therefore struck out of their minutes the pur-
pose of applying to parliament, and they send
instructions in these words :

** The delegates are instructed, on the part
of the society, ty assist in bringing forward
and supporting any constitutional measures -
fer procuring a real representation of the |
Commons of Great Hritain in parliament—
that, in specifying the redress to be demanded
of existing abuses, the delegates ought never!
to lose sight of the two essential principles,
general suffrage and annual representation,
together with the unalienable right in the
poopie to reform, and that a reasonable and

nown compensation ought to be made to‘
the representatives of the nation by a national
contribution.” What they meant by the re-
presentatives of the nation, after what I have
already read to you, I think you cannot pos-
sibly mistake. .

London Correspanding Society are’
somewhat bolder in the instructions, which
they send with their delegates to the conven-
tion in Scotland : you will find these instruc-
tions are to the following effect :—By article
the 1st, the delegate is instructed “ that he
shallon no account depart from the original
object and principle of this society; namely,
the obtaining annua! parliaments, and uni-
versal suffrage, by rational and lawful means. ©

2d. To support the-opinions that repre-

sentatives in parliament ought to be. paid by
their constituents, :

““7th, That itis the duty of the people”
--now, gentlemen, I beg your attention to
this; it is the principle, upon which the con-
vention in Scotland was formed, and upon
which it acted: * That it is the duty of the
people to resist uny act of parliament, repug-
nant to the original principles of the constitu-
tion, as would be every attempt to prohibit
associations for the purpose of reform.”

: Gentlemen, there is no government in this
country, if this principle is to be acted upon,
because nobody can tell to what extent it will
Bo and accordingly you will see that these

lelegates, who went into Scotland, with this
authority in their hands, carried the autho-
tity far beyond the resistance, which they
were authorized to make according to the
principles t:ere laid down, and they state a
preat variety of cases, all approved afterwards

oth by the London Corrésponding, and the
Constitutional Society, in which the people,
and the convention of the people, were to re-
sist parliament.

- Gentlemen, these societies having sent de-
legates to the conyention in Scotland, I pro-
ceed now to state that the acts of that con-
vention, to the extent at least to which the
delegates from this country were authorized to
act, are evidence against those who sent them
and therefore against the persons here in-
dicted. But farther, they communicated to
the societies here, particularly to the prisoner
at the bar, their acts; and the societies here,
in distinct resolutions, acting upon considera-
tion, approved their whole conduct: they
therefure made that conduct of their delegates
in the convention in Scotland, whether it was
agrecable to the original authority which was
given them, or not, their own; they adopted
ut by giving it their subsequent approbation.

. Gentlemen, you will find, first of all, that
they received a letter from the Sheffield So-
ciety, athliating with them, in which it was
Proposed to determine like Englishmen.

_ After receiving a great deal of other corres-
pondence, which I will not trouble you with
reading, the societies here prepare to send de-
legates to Scotland. Mr. Skirving sent a cir-
cular letter upon the arrival of the English de-
legates to the delegates of all the associations
in Scotland, which were extremely numerous,
and very widely extended; and I think the
delegates of these difterent societies came to-
gether to the number of one hundred and
eighty. After sitting some time, Mr. Mar-

rot, you will find, who was the delegate of
the London Corresponding Society, represents
to the body there met—“ That the societies in
London were very numerous, though some-
tumes fluctuating ; that in some part of Eng-
land whole towns are reformers: that in Shef-
field and the environs there are fifty thousand ;
that in Norwich there are thirty societies in
one; that if they could get a convention of
England and Scotlan , they might re-


present six or seven hundred thousand males,
which is a majority of all the adults in the
kingdom.” —

You will find Mr. Margarot moves, that,
previous to publishing an address to the public
a committee should be appointed to consider
the means, and draw up a plan of general
union and co-operation—between what? Not
between any societies in the two nations, but
a plan of general union and co-operation
between the two nations. In their constitutional
parent of a theory of parliamentary re-
form, they stylejthemselvesa convention, and
this, gentlemen, is extremely material for Pi
to attend to; they style themeelves, “ The
British Convention of the delegates of the
people associated to obtain universal s
and annual parliaments.” Then I ask what
is a convention of the people according to
these societies? According to the proceed-
ings in Scotland, a convention of the people is
a convention of the delegates from s0-
cieties in England and Scotland. _

They assert that the people have in them all
civil and political authority; and they, re-
peatedly, again and again, from the moment
that this convention was formed in Scotland
to the moment of its dispersion, more especi-
ally at the time of its dispersion, more espe-
cially still from the time of its dispersion tll
the time of a meeting on the 20th of January,
at the Globe tavern; and on the 27th of
March, when another convention was pro-
posed, as I stated at the outset, they repeat-
edly and in the most pressing terms state that
now or never was the time, when the people
were to meet, when they were to act by their
own force, when they were courageously to
prepare themselves for the event, and to show
those whom they called their oppressors and
plunderers, that they were a brave people, in
whom valour was not extinct. .

Having thus met together, upon the princi-
ples of the French system, which took place
on the 10th of. August 1792, they proceed di-
rectly to the French practices, which took
place then in the National Assembly of France,
took place then hecause the people of France
were understood to be represented by aconven-
tion ; these delegates taking upon themselves
also to be aconvention of the people, they
instituted Primary Societies, they divided the
country into departments, they appointed pro-
vincial assemblies, they have Committees of
Union, they thank for patriotic donations, they
assume an epoch, they appoint a Secret Com-
mittee to be called together upon extraordi-
nary emergencies; and upon the 28th of No~
vember 1793, they come toa resolution, to
which I must beg your most serious attention.

Gentlemen of the jury, you will remember
that they went with authorities, which stated
to them that it was the duty of the people,
which people they had taken upon themselves
to represent, to resist any act of parliament,
that should be made for a parti purpose.
It is hardly, I think, to be contended, that the


pat bulk of the people of this country, ; ing wrongous imprisonment and against un-

ppy in their political existence, as undoubt-

edly they are, remaining happy in their po-
litical existence, because they do not teel
grievances (till they are taught by malignant
industry to believe that they exist), I mean to
such a degree as to call for measures of this
sort, could believe that the legislature of the
country, doing justice to the subjects, whoin
it is bound to protect, would permit a proceed-
ing of this kind to go on—yet, gentlemen,
confiding su much as these persons did in the
supposed state of their number-in that coun- ;
try,and of those who were to be connected
with them in this, you will find that, upon the
28th of November 1793, one of the persons
belonging to that convention, citizen Sinclair,
I think, the members all standing up upon
their feet, for the greater solemnity of the
thing, proposes this resolution— Resolved
that the following declaration and resolutions
be inserted at the end of our minutes—“ That
this convention”—now if it be possible to say .
that any convention means to act asa con- ,
yention of the people, it is that which sets it-
selfabove the legislature in the act it is doing
—“ that this convention, considering the ca- |
lamitous consequences of any act of the le-
gislature, which may tend to deprive the
whole or any part of the people of their un-
doubted right to meet, either by themselves
or by delegation, to discuss any matter re-
lative to their common interest, whether of a
public or private nature, and holding the same
to be totally inconsistent with the first prin-
ciples and safety of society, and also subver-
sive of our known and acknowledged consti-
tutional liberties.”—

Gentlemen, permit me to. call your atten-
tion to this, that this declaration, in its prin-
ciples, follows the instructions that they had
teceived, that, if any attempt was made to
bring in a convention bill, they were then to
doso and so. They then proceed thus—“ do
declare before God and the world, that we
shall tollow the wholesome example of former
times, by paying no regard to any act, which
shall militate against the constitution of our
country”’—That 1s saying, that the will of the
legislature is not a better judge of what is an
act against the constitution of the country,
than the affiliated clubs at Edinburgh—“ and
shall continue to assemble and consider of the
best means by which we can accomplish a
teal representation of the people,” is that a
parliament ?—“ and annual election, until”—
ae ?— until compelled to desist by superior
force.

“ And we do resolve that the first notice
fiven”—The first notice—parliament is not
even to discuss the thing; but, if an intima-
tion of it is _made in parliament—“ That the

notice given for the introduction of a con-
Yention bill, or any bill of a similar tendency to
that passed in Ireland in the last session of their
parliament, or any bill for the suspension of
the Habeas Corpus act, or the act for prevent-

due delays in trials in North Britain, or in
case of an invasion”.

Gentlemen, I call back to your recollection
the Ictter of Skirving—I call back to your
recollection not only the letter of Skirving,
but that the troops of liberty were promised
to be sent with bayonets and pikes from that
country, which at this moment was likely to
invade us—“ or the admission of any foreign

| troops whatsoever, into Great Britain or Ire

land”—If the parliament of this country, for
the purpose of protecting itself against that
foreign invasion, had brought these foreign
troops into Great Britain or Ireland, not
being the troops of a nation with which we

: were at war, this convention of the people was to

act upon the introduction of such foreign troops
in the same manner as they would act in case
of an invasion by those who were at war with
us—What is the construction that follows
upon that?—that, even if foreign troops, to
meet the exigence of an invasion, were intro-
duced—what then ?—* all or any one of these
calamitous circumstances”—why calamitous ?
they might be necessary for the very existence
of the country—“ shall be a signal to the
several delegates to repair to such place as.
the secret committee of this convention shall
appoint, and the first seven members shall
have power’—to do what?—to do that ex-
actly, which a national convention in France
would do—* to declare the sittings perma-
nent’—why? Because the duly constituted
legislature of the country had dared, not to
do an act, but to entertain a deliberation upon
doing an act—the first notice was to call toge-
ther this convention, and being called together,
their sittings were to be permanent.

Gentlemen, are the parties tu this conven-
tion in Scotland such men, as would think of
bringing themselves together to declare their
sittings permanent upon such a gout as
they state here, namely, the legislature of a
great country acting in the execution of the
great duties which belong to the legislature
of that country, without supposing, by that
solemn declaration, that they could make
their meeting effectual by the acts which were
to be carried on for the purpose of preventing
that legislature from deliberating upon such
duties? By what acts could it be done but by
exertions, as they style them, in the manner
of their forefathers, by force? By affiliated
societies, exerting their physical strength
that physical exertion, which Mr. Barlow
observes is to be preceded or presided by
spreading useful knowledge, and that useful
knowledge, being that which is to beat down
the existing authority of King, Lords, and
Commons.

“ The convention therefore resolve, that
each delegate immediately on his return home
do convene his constituents, and explain to
them the necessity of electing a delegate or
delegates, and of establishing a fund without
delay, against any of these emergencies, for

his or their expense, and that they do instruct
the said delegate or delegates to hold them-
selves ready"——

Gentlemen, you see what they expected
from the legislature—they knew that what
they were doing ought to provoke the legis-
Tature to do what they meant to forbid the
legislature to do: and they instruct their de-
legate or delegates to hold themselves read:
—“ to depart at one hour’s warning.” Well

ight Mr. Skirving say, that a month's delay,
ged ile whole was lost : well might Mr. Hardy
say, sie he ort in letters | abel produce
presently, that i opportunity is lost now,
it is lost for ever—we must act now, or we
never can. Having some reason to suppose
that this convention would be dispersed, they
then with great solemnity come to another
resolution :

“ That the moment of any illegal disper-
sion of the British Convention shall be consi-
dered as a summons to the delegates to re-
pair to the place of meeting appointed for
the convention of emergency hy the Secret
Committee, and that the Secret Committee
be instructed without delay to proceed to fix
the place of meeting.” Gentlemen, after
these resolutions it became necessary to do a
little more, that is, to declare upon what prin-
ciples this conyeniee existed. Now mar ue

inciples, and do your country justice; a
Laren of the puarseliane tae Thave mate
to you, as are worthy your attention, to what
I have beture stated as the necessary con-
nexion between the principle and practice of
Mr. Paine, and of these societies.

Gentlemen, these principles brought toge-
ther the French Convention—what is the

ractice then, that flows-out of the principle?
hy, it is the assembling of a convention
upon principles obliging it to sit for the pur-
pose of declaring that the eeilelne shall do
nothing but what they liked: that is to all
intents and purposes a National Convention ;
if not a convention for an eternal reform, at
least a convention, that probibits the legisla-
ture to do any thing but what is agreeable to
them. Then having met for the execution of
the practice, they proceed immediately to the
declaration of the principle—but they do not
proceed to a declaration of the principle, till
they have done that strong and solemn act,
which I have stated: then they resolve “ that
acommittee be appointed to draw up a decla-
ration”’—This is France exactly—It is the
Southwark Society in 1792—“ a declaration
of the natural imprescriptible rights of man,
and that the same be prefixed to an address
to the people of Great Britain. That a com-
mittee of observation,” that is, for the better
effectuating the purpose that they had before
declared, ““be appointed in London to give the
earliest intimation of any motion of the kind
mentioned in the foregoing resolutions to the
different societies.”
You will then find that they met in a place,
which they call Convention Hall, under the

wt


name of the British Convention, and then they
are informed that the London Corresponding
Society would undertake tobe that committee
of observation, which, they say, ought to exist
—and then you will find that the members
mentioned that they had thousands of their
constituents in London, Sheffield, Norwich,

eds, &c. and that the convention was to
look at itself as in its true nature a Committee
of the people—that therefore it was necessary
to have, as they have in France Primary
Societies, who shall be consulted—in other
words, that this committee of the pores
Edinburgh, which was to overrule the ogi
lature, was itself to be overruled by these Pri-
mary Societies, these primary societies them-
selves being overruled by the leaders of the
great clubs, from which they emanated, and
so forming in this country a government,
under the power of a Jacobin Club, and that
ereounen destroying the present existing”
legislature of the kingdom.

You will also find that, before these persons
parted, Mr. Margarot communicated to his
constituents the proceedings of this body,
which he styles always the Convention of t
People associated to obtain annual parlia-
ments and universal suffrage. There are let-
ters which I shall lay before you, without
detailing them, stating that they looked up
to the London Corresponding Society, and
the Society for Constitutional Information—
that their active exertions were necessary for
the accomplishing the projects, which the:
sitting in Edinburgh were to execute; aad
then the two delegates of the London Corres-
ponding Society write to Mr. Hardy, as the
secretary of that society, an account of their
proceedings—they give him an account of
that solemn motion, and of the manner of
making it, which I have just been detailing
to you—they state to him that they had de-
termined to assemble in convention in any
such case— that the appointment of the place,
which is a circumstance I beg your most
serious attention to, was left to a Secret Com-
mittee; but then they send to him an ac-
count of the motion, infurming him in the
letter—that “letters convey but very imper-
fectly, and with no great degree of safety,
what we might wish to inform each other of.*

Now what do you think it is that they do
not inform him of in this letter?—They do
Not inform him in this letter, because letters
will not convey every thing safely—that the
convention was tu meet in case of invasion—
that was a secret, which durst not be trusted
to correspondence by letter, and because it
existed in that motion which wasmade, every
other part of it being communicated even in a
letter, they consider it of such a nature, that
they determine not to insert it even in their
own minutes.

This Secret Committee having been ap-

inted in the Scotch Convention, the fact

ing communicated to the London Corres-
ponding Society by their delegates, you will-

likewise find that Mr. Sinclair, the delegate
from the Constitutional Society to the So-
ciety at Edinburgh, was not behindhand in the
communication of it: he communicates the
proceedings, and desires that a secret com-
mittee may be appointed in that society. It
was not long after this, that the wisely ex-
erted power of the magistracy of that country
dispersed that convention. The dispersion of
that convention, which, from what I have
before stated to you, was conceived to bea
body that must then do its work, or its work
never would be done, suggested to the socie-
ties of this country the necessity of under-
ing the same business, of undertaking it
at the same hazard, knowing that the project
must either then be accomplished, or that it
never could thereafter be attempted—for that
no government could permit such a conven-
tion as this to meet, when its nature was
teally understood, without taking some means
to protect itself against the consequences of
the existence of such.a convention.
Gentlemen, you will therefore find, that,
after they had been dispersed, and aftcr, in
consequence of that dispersion, some of them
had been punished in Scotland, by sentences
which were pronounced upon offences, not
stated in the records of that court in so aggra-
vated a way against them as they might, in
my humble opinion, have been stated, that it
became ni that some step should
be taken immediately to prevent the mischief
ich was meditated; for you will find, in
the evidence, propositions in these societies
about a rescue, which failed; but Pe: will
find in their correspondence from Scotland,
and their correspondence from those ships in
which the members of the Scotch Convention
were before they sailed in execution of their
sentences, not only the strongest invitations
to do some strong acts in this country, to
both societies, but, on the other hand, the
strongest and most unequivocal declarations
pee societies, that these strong acts must
ne.

Gentlemen, you will find that before they
left Scotland, upon the 11th of December,
1793, there is a letter from Mr. Margarot to
Mr. Hardy to this effect—“ We received your
letter and remittance yesterday, and shall be
glad to receive another such without delay.

“ The convention you will see has declared
Nself permanent; they are to sit jn some
other part of the country, which is not yet

Gentlemen, Mr. Sinclair, the delegate of
the Constitutional Society, came to London.
Ihave before observed to you, from a letter
of Gerrald * and Margarot, that there were
some things that could not safely be conveyed
by letter. Margarot writes a letter from
Edinburgh to the ‘prisoner, in which he says
—* My colleague, Gerrald, also proposes to
leave place the latter end of this, or the



Deginning of the next week: he will expleia
himself to you: Pray send him ‘money for
this journey, &c. He is now gone to Perth
on very urgent business. Since Sinclair's
departure nothing new has occurred, except
the formation of a society somewhere about
the Grampian Hills’—this shows the spirit
of fraternization—“ they have already made
a subscription towards it: again we are in-
terrupted, and likely tu lose the post, unless
I dispatch this immediately.” ;

Upon the 22d of December 1793, another
letter is written to Mr. Hardy by the same
gentleman, which probably led in some de-
gree, to the transactions that I have to state
as having passed in January 1794; for, after
stating what had happened to himself ip
Scotland, he says— Sheffield has on this
occasion exhibited a most manly spirit’ —
The Sheffield Society had at that time sent
out some excessively strong resolutions,
which I shall give you in evidence in. the
course of this business—“ I am extremely
mortified to find so great a difference between
them and the London Corresponding Society ;
itis not however too late. For God's make
send forth some very strong resolutions, and
above all, talk of impeachments, and of
petitioning the king to remove from their
offices those persons who have thus violated
the laws of the realm.”

You will find from a letter of the 24th of
December, that spp ales a delegate of the
London Society, a delegate of Norwich, and
a Mr. Brown, who was the delegate from
Sheffield, had gone to attend a general meet-
ing of the Society of the Friends of Freedom
in'East Lothian, and then the expression is—
™ The time is come that we must show ourselves
worthy of liberty, or deservedly lose it. The
opposition of our adversaries is demonstra-
tion of the propriety and efficacy of the means
which we have employed to obtain it.”

Upon the 27th of December 1793, a
will find Mr. Margarot states that Mr. Ger-
rald was gone to Perth; that he himself had
been in t Lothian ; that they had been
well employed; that they must send out spi-
rited resolutions; and you will find, that, upon
the 11th of January 1794, Mr. Hardy writes
a letter to Norwich relative to the proceedings
I have now been stating, the Constitutional
Society first, and the London Corresponding
Society afterwards, peving in their public acts
approved every thing that this convention
had done. Mr. Hardy’s letter runs thus:

“TI have just received a letter from citizen
Margarot, at Edinburgh, with some of the
Edinburgh Gazetteers, where you will see
that citizen Skirving is found guilty, and
sentenced for fourteen years transportation
to Botany Bay. Margarot’s trial comes
next; he meets it with great firmness and
resolution. I have no time to make m
comments on the proceedings, but I thi
our opponents are cutting their. own throats

‘| as fast as they can—Now is the time for us to

do something worthy of men: the brave de-
Senders of liberty, south of the English channel,
are performing wonders, driving their enemies
before them like chaff before the whirlwind.
Margarot tells me that he has not time to
write to you just now, but he hopes to have
time very soon, when his trial is over, and
immured in a prison. The London Corres-
‘ponding Society is to have a general meeting,
and an anniversary dinner on Monday the
20th instant, at the Globe tavern, Strand.” -
Gentlemen, you will find that Mr. Mar-
garot, this delegate, with whom Mr. Hardy is
thus in correspondence, writes to the Nor-
wich United Societies—“ This morning ten
ships of war have left Spithead for the
channel; and it is here reported, that the
Brest fleet is out. Rumour, always magni-
fying things, says there are seventy sail of
the French at sea; if so, there must be a
number of transports among them, and a descent
may probably be the consequence—for God's
whe: my worthy friends, do not relax in the
cause of freedom.”—Now what connexion had
‘a descent with the cause of freedom?—
‘“ Continue as you have begun; conselidate
.your own societies—unite with others—
rsevere, and make no doubt, but, sooner or
later, your endeavours will be crowned with
success.” :
Gentlemen, I come now to state to you

‘the proceedings of the year 1794, as far as |

ithey depend upon written evidence; and it
must be a satisfaction to the mind of every
‘man who hears me, that, in the course of

this business, whatever observations may |

‘arise upon the parol eyidence that will be

“given you, I think ‘you will find so strong a |

confirmation of all you are to hear in the
written evidence that is to be laid before you,
‘that these observations cannot possibly mis-
lead you from coming to the true conclusion
upon the whole of the evidence, whatever
‘that may be. .
* Gentlemen,. the Constitutional Society,
having sent their delegate to the Scotch Con-
‘vention, you will find that, ata meeting of
“the 17th of January 1794, the following reso-
‘lutions were come to, to which I must desire
your particular attention, more especially as
there are some circumstances belonging to
the composition of those resolutions, which
appear to me to be worthy of attention. I
have before told you that these resolutions
“were usually drawn from minutes—the ori-
ginal minutes still exist, and perhaps they
show that discretion, with which men are
sometimes able to state, in different ways,
precisely the same thing: I say, that these
Tesolutions of the 17th of January 1794, were
meant to excite the subjects of this country
to resistance. co

“ Resolved, That law ceases to be an ob-
ject of obedience, whenever it becomes an
instrument of oppression.

“ Resolved, That we recall to mind, with


the infamous Jefferies, once lord chief jus-
tice of England, who, at the era of the glo-
rious revolution, for the many iniquitous sen-
tences which he had passed, was torn to
pieces by a brave and injured people.” This
1s applied to the judges of Scotland, who exe-
cuted the law upon such facts as I have
been stating —“ That those who imitate his
example deserve his fate”—this sort of inti-
mation might have a tendency, I hope it had
not, to put in any peril those who did, in the
regular course, and in the due course, of
their judicial duties, pass those sentences, to
which these resolutions allude.

“ That the Tweed, though it may divide
countries, ought not, and does not, make a
separation between those principles of com-
‘mon severity in which Englishmen and
Scotchmen are equally interested; that in-
justice in Scotland is-injustice in England;
and that the safety of Englishmen is endan-
gered, whenever their brethren in Scotland,
for a conduct ‘which entitles them to the
approbation ofall wise, and the support of all
brave men, are sentenced to Botany Bay, a
punishment hitherto intlicted only on felons.

“That we see with regret, but we see

without fear, that the period is fast approacli-
ing when the liberties of Britons”—this was
in January—“ must depend, not upon reason,
to which they have long appealed, nor on
their powers of expressing it, but on their
| firm and undaunted resolution to ‘oppose
tyranny by the same means by which it is
exercised.” Now what is thetyranny? The
exercise of the regular government of the
} country. What is the means by which it is
exercised? The application of the force of
the country in support of the government of
the country. What is this resolution then?
Why, that the means which the government
takes in the regular exercise of its functions,
ought now to be resisted— We see it with
regret, but do not see it with any fear.”*
' That a breach of allegiance was contem-
plated you.can have no doubt, for you will
see in the original of this that it stood thus =
that, “ as allegiance and protection are reci-
procal, law ccuses to be an object of obedi-
ence, wherever it becomes an instrument of
eppressian Cae that, as it stood origi-
nally, with the third resolution, and what #
it? Why, it is—that the protection, which
was due from Kim to whom allegiance is due,
has not been afforded: therefore allegiance is
no longer due. “ We see with regret, but we
see without fear, that the period is fast ap-
proaching, when the liberties of Britons must
depend, not upon reason, to which they have
long appealed, nor on their powers of expres-
ing it, but on-their firm ard undaunted reso-
lution to oppose tyranny by the same means
by which it is exercised.”

You will also find that it stood, “that
lishmen feel the oppression of Scotehmen,
which they are determined to resist at the

‘fhe deepest satisfaction, the merited fate of | hazard of their lives,”"—You will find the lass


resolution, in the minates, comparing the ge-
buine representatives of this country, in the
House of Commons, with this convention in
Scotland, which convention in Scotland had
taken upon itself to resolve upon resistance
to even a motion, in either House of Parlia-
ment of this country, in the execution of their
duty, thus :

“That we approve of the conduct of the
British Convention, who, though assailed by
force, have not been answered by arguments,
and who, unlike the members of a certain
assembly, have no interest distinct from the
common body of the peuple”—The words ori-
ginally e008 who “ being the incorrupt re-
presentatives of many thousands, have spoken
the | ge of truth and firmness.” Can I
make this court the instrument of conveying
to the public, what I cenfess I do most anxi-
ously wish to make it the instrument of con-
veying to the public, as far as it is fit, in the
execution of the duty that I am now dis-
charging, that they may understand what it
is that men, when they are scattering these
libels through the country, mean—“ this con-
vention, assailed by force, have not been ans-
wered by arguments”—How was it possible
to answer those by arguments, who were comt-
ing to solemn and sacred resolutions, which
they did not even dare to put upon the face of
their own minutes? How were we to answer
those by ment, who were working under
ground till they had blown up the govern-
ment, and then say, you cannot point out that
we have been acting ill, because we will not
tell you how we have been acting ?

Upon the 16th, Mr. Margarot writes again,
leaving them to pursue what sort of conduct
they please.

Then there is a letter of some importance
of the 28th of January, which is written to
the person who stands at the bar—“ We have
justreceived notice from the sheriff to hold our-
selves nenly We depart at an hour's warning:
we night; we imagine to Newgate;
Jeol ove boytec “

Gentlemen, you will likewise find a letter
from Mr. Margarot to Mr. Hardy, of great con-
sequence, as it explains many of the passages
im the evidence between the 20th of January
1704, and the time that those persons were
apprehended. Margarot writes from Edin-
burgh in this manner :—“ armed associations
are, I ewe, now set on foot by the rich;
wherefore should not the poor do the same?

“ Are you to wait patiently till twenty thou-
sand Hessians and Hanoverians come to cut
your throats? And will you stretch forth
your necks like lambs to the butcher’s knife,
and, like lambs, content yourselves with
bleating? Pray let me hear from you soon.
Remember me to Moffat, Muir, and Palmer,
and all suffering brethren.”

Gentlemen, upon the 20th of January 1794,
there was a meeting at the Globe tavern;
that meeting, which, you will permit me to
observe, Hardy mentioned in his letter of the



11th of January 1794, which I before have
spoken of, when he said the London Corres-
ponding Society were to have a general
meeting, and an anniversary dinner. Gen-
tlemen, the proceedings of that day will des
serve your very particular attention.

* Ata general meeting of the London Cor.
responding Society, held at the Globe tavern,
Strand, on Monday the 20th day of January
1794, citizen John Martin in the chair,”—
when I state this to you, I ought to say that I
shall prove the prisoner to have been present,
or to have been connected with all the trans-
actions that I have been stating—* the fol-
lowing address to the people of Great Britain
and Ireland, was read and agreed to : citizens,
We find the nation involved in a war, by
which, in the course of one campaign, im-
mense numbers of our countrymen have been
slaughtered ; a vast expense has been incur-
red; our trade, commerce, and manufactories
are almost destroyed ; and many of our ma
nufacturers and artists are ruined, and their
families starving.

“To add to our affliction, we have reason
to expect that other taxes will soon be adied
to the intolerable load of imposts and imposi-
tions, with which we are already overwhelm
ed, for the purpose of defraying the expenses
which have been incurred in a fruitless cre-
sade, to re-establish the odious despotism of
France. Co

“ When we contemplate the principles of
this war, we confess ourselves to be unable to
approve of it as a measure either of justice or
discretion; and, if we are to form our calcu
lation of the result, from what has already
passed, we can only look forward to defeat,
and the eternal disgrace of the British name.

« While we are thus engaged in an expen
sive and ruinous foreign war, our state at
home is not less deplorable.

% We are every day told by those persone
who are interested in aap ns the corrup-
tion list, and an innumerable host of sinecure
placemen, that the constitution of England is
the perfection of human wisdom; that our
laws (we should rather say their laws) are the
perfection of justice; and that their adminis-
tration of those laws is so impartial and so
Teady, a3 to afford an equal remedy both to
the rich and to the poor, by means of which
we are said to be placed in a state of absolute
freedom.” The paper then goes on and rea-
sons upon the state of the law in this country,
under an exposition of Magna Charta, which
gives as nearly the true meaning of it as »
man would give, who had never seen it.

“Jf we look to Ireland, we find that ae-
knowledged privilege of the people to mect
for the support and protection of their rights
and liberties, is attempted by terror to be
taken away, by a late mfamous act of parlia-
ment.”—That was an act to prevent conven-
tion by delegates with dangerous objects.
© Whilst titles of honour—no—but of disho-
pour, are lavished, and new sources of cos-

2A

ruption opened to gratify the greedy prostitu-
tion of those who ns the instruments of this
oppression.

“In Scotland, the wicked hand of power
has been impudently exerted without even
the wretched formality of an act of parlia-
ment.”—A piece of parchment justice they
call an act, in the convention of Scotland. —
“ istrates have forcibly intruded into the

eaceful and lawful meetings of freemen, and

y force (not only without law, but against
Jaw) have, under colour of magisterial office,
interrupted their deliberations, and prevented
their association.

“ The wisdonr and good conduct of the
British Convention in Edinburgh has been
such, as to defy their bitterest enemies to
name the law which they bave broken; not-
withstanding which, their papers have been
seized and made use of as evidence against
them, and many virtuous and meritorious in-
dividuals have been, as cruelly as unjustly,
for their virtuous actions, disgraced and des-
troyed by infamous and illegal sentences of
transportation; and these unjust and wicked
judgments have been-executed with a rancour
-and malignity never before known in this
land; our respectable and beloved fellow
Citizens have been cast fettered into dungeons,
amongst felons in the hulks, to which they
were not sentenced. .

“Citizens, we all approve the sentiments,
‘and are daily repeating the words for which
‘these our respectable and valuable brethren
‘are thus, unjustly and inhumanly, suffering ;

, we do associate”—mark the expression—“ in
order to obtain a fair, free, and full represen-
tation of the people in a house of real national
representatives.”—Now, did the convention
st Edinburgh then associate for the purpose

to obtain a fair, free, and full representation
of the people in a house of real national re-
presentatives? if they did, they associated to
form that house of real representatives upon
this principle, that they were, as Mr. Skirving
calls them, the people in Scotland, that they
were to athliate, and to associate themselves

‘with societies in England; and that, in that

state of affiliation and association, holding a

convention, as they call it, of the people, from
delegates of these societies, and not el the
people—to do what ?—why, to meet as an as-
-sembly, which assembly was to control the
operations of periments of that parliament,
which must be the representatives of the
Commons of the nation ; an expression, which
by the way, they never used, adopting ene’
rally terms of a different import, “ fNa-
tional Representatives.”
‘Are we also willing to be treated as felons
for claiming this our inherent right? which
we are determined never to forego but with
our lives, and which none but thieves and
-traitors”—that is, persons acting in the regu-
dar execution of the functions of magistracy—
‘can wish to withhold from us? consider, it

sone and the same corrupt aud corrupting


[356

influence, which at this time domineers in
Treland, Scotland, and England: can you be-
lieve that those, who send virtuous Irishmen
and Scotchmen, fettered with feluns to Bo-
tany Bay, do not meditate, and will not at-
tempt te seize the first moment, to send us
after them; or if we had not just cause to
apprehend the same inbuman treatment, if,
instead of the most imminent danger, we
were in perfect safety from it, should we not

isdain to enjoy any liberty or privilege what-
ever in which our honest Irish and Scotch
brethren did not equally and as fully partici-
pate with us? Their cause then, and ours, is
the same, and it is both our duty and our in-
terest to stand or fall together.”

Gentlemen, recollect the expressions that
Tread to yeu from Skirving’s letter: “ will
you wait till barracks are erected in every
village, and till subsidized Hessians and Han-
overians are upon us?” You will now see
from the proceedings I am stating to you, that
the time was come, that they were not only vir-
tuous but courageous enough to do an act,
which in 1792 and 1793, though they were
virtuous enough to do, they were not cow
rageous enough to do.

“ You may ask. perhaps, by what means
shall we seek redress? We answer, that men
in a state of civilized society, are bound to
seek redress of the grievances from the laws,
as long as any redress can be obtained by the
laws; but our common master, whom we
serve (whose law is a law of liberty, and
whose service is perfect freedom), has taught
us not to expect to gather grapes from thorns,
or figs from thistles: we must have redress
Jrom our own laws.” —Were they to be a con-
vention of the people, then, without making
laws? They approve the whole conduct of
the British Convention, that would not let
others make laws, and yet were they not to
make laws? .

“ We must have redress from our own laws,”
and not from other laws ;—the laws of Great
Britain are thus described,—“ the laws of our
plunderers, enemies, and oppressors :” indeed,
if the legislature of their country were their
plunderers, enemies, and oppressors, in their
Notions, it would be very difficult to suppose,
that they were to have redress from the laws
of that legislature; but then it follo of
course, that they meant to have reiress Ronn
laws made by some other body, that had au-
thority to make laws: and what that other
bodyis, but the Convention which they deter-
mine upon must be left for those to say, who
can find it out. They go on then to say,

‘“ There is no redress for a nation circum-
stanced as we are, but in a fair, free, and ful
representation of the people.”—Now, here
again I ask, what is that fair, full,and free
representation of the people, not mentioned
to be in parliament? but if it was, it would be
precisely the same phrase as occurred at the
time of the Common-wealth. But they take
upon them toapprove of the BritishConveation,

and to unite the two nations of England and
Scotland, to be a British Convention formed
by delegates from the different societies in
this ager kot professing to act as a con-
vention of the people; I say, that it is ¢hat spe-
cies of convention, which, in their opinion «vas
a anes Sree, and full representation of the peo-
pée, in which, and which alone, they hoped
for that redress, which they could not bope
for from the parliament of Great Britain,
those,who were their plunderers,their enemies,
and oppressors. Could it be possible for them
to suppose, that they could make parliament
the willing or unwilling organ of bringing
about this representation of the people to
subsist by annual suffrage and universal re-
Presentation? Could it have entered into
their imagination that those whom -they -call
their plunderers, enemies, and oppressors,
would ever become the voluntary or involun-
tary instrument of doing that which was the
object of all these societies, from March 1791,
till they were checked in the execution of their
purposes?

Then follows a resolution that will require
likewise your very particular attention : “ Re-
solved, That during the ensuing session of
parliament the general committee of this so-
ciety do meet daily, for the purpose of watch-
ing the proceedings of the parliament and of
the administration of the government of this
country.” This was to be published: they do
not therefore venture to insert totidem verbis
that resolution, which I have stated to you
was so solemnly made, and so sacredly sworn
to in the Scotch Convention, but they resolve
-—“ that upon the first introduction of any bill
or motion inimical to the liberties of the peo-

le, such as for landing foreign troops in Great
ritain or Ireland, for suspending the Habeas
Corpus act, for proclaiming martial law, or for
preventing the people from meeting in socie-
ties for constitutional information” — What the
meaning of the term constitutional is we can
judge by this time—that uponany express mo-
tion of this nature, “or any other innovation
o «@ similar nature ; that on any of these
emergencies the general committee shall issue
summonses to the delegates of each division,
and also to the secretaries of the different so-
cieties affiliated and corresponding with-this
society, forthwith to calla eae caecalin
of the people, to be held at such place, and in
such a manner, as shall be specified in the
sammons, for the purpose of taking such mea-
sures into their consideration.” They omit
the case of invasion in this publication. But
what is this, supposing nothing had passed in
Scotland of what I have stated to you? What!
Is the legislature, is the rule and government
in this great country reduced to this state,
that it shall ind no protection in the admi-
nistration of the law of the country against
ns, associating and affiliating themselves

x the purposes which they declare here?
Is no motion to be made in parliament for
amy purpose, which these societies choose to


comprehend under the terms “ any other inne-
vation,” without explaining what it means?-
but what? but that bodies of men are to
come together, claiming to themselves the
civil and political authority, which exists im
the natural and physical qualities of the peo-
ple, and then to contend that they have gota
convention of the people?

Now, do they canvene the-people? In faet,
it will.be said, nothing like it. t they cali
themselves a convention of the people in the
very terms that they use. the summonses
are to go to the delegates of each meeting,
and also the secretaries of the different socie-
ties corresponding with this society, and no
where else. For what purpose? ‘To call a
general convention of the people! Then, what
w.the meaning of all that, taking it with its
context? It is thise from your laws—the
laws of you, our plunderers, enemies, and op-
pressors—we can expect no relief: we do not
mean to come to you fur any: but we will
watch you, and if you dare to propose an in-
novation of any sort, we shall call a fain, Sree,
and full representation of the people. Com-
posed pray how? By delegates from our so-
cieties, to seek, as a general convention of the
People, redress from our own laws. It ap-
pears to me that the reasoning upon this paper
1s so whole and intire, that it is out of
power of human ingenuity to touch it.

Then they resolve, “ That a hundred thou-
sand copies of the Address to the people of
Great Britain and Ireland shall be printed.”
Then they follow.this up with the publication
of a great many toasts ; and really, when one
mentions such a thing as toasts in the trial of
a greatnational cause, such as this undoubt-
edly is, one is afraid of its sinking into insig-
nificance ; and yet this is a great feature in

this cause. You will find that previously to one

ofthe most seditious meetings which was ever
held in this country, it was thought of impor~
tance enough that they should meet once,
twice, or thrice, in committees, in arder to
frame toasts, which were best calculated to
inflame their minds,and to urge those forward
who were already engaged.in these projects—-
“ The Rights of Man:”—“ The British Con-
vention ;”—** Success to the arms of freedom,
against whomsoever directed.” This is during
the war—against whom were the armsof free~
dom directed, in the opinion of these persons?
You remember they said that “ the elector of
Hanover may join his troops to traitors and
robbers; but.the king of Great Britain will
do well to remember that this country is not.
Hanover: should he forget the distinction,
we will not.” They corresponded with the
French in October; and in November 1792,
they state to you, that the principles of their
resolutions are those upon which they meant
to act—that Great Britain was now engaged
in a war—which they mmned—in which
the arms of freedom, as ghey said, had never
been engaged on the part of Great Britain.
Then the meaning of the toast is obvieus,

Another toast was—“ The virtuous and spi-
rited citizens now in confinement for matters
of opinion.” Now, these matters of opinion
are acts all done in the long tissue and detail
of aconspiracy to subvert the monarchical go-
vernment of this country, under its present
legal provisions and limitations.
‘The name of Mr. Frost being mentioned—
I'mean him no disrespect in saying this—but
it is tothe purpose of this business to take
Notice of it—that gentleman was prosecuted
in this country for this doctrine—“ No king,
none in England, I am for liberty and equality
every where.” What was the consequence
of that? The judgment of the law of England
upon him was, that he was guilty of an of-
fence: he was punished: he has suffered that
punishment, and made an atonement to the
Jaw: but these gentlemen, who sent Mr.
Frost with Mr. Barlow, to state such doctrine
to France, and_br:ng such doctrine baek from
France, you will find that they havea formal
resolution that they will sustain this Mr. Frost
in all his persecutions and prosecutions. Docs
that mean nothing? If Mr. Frost is perse-
euted for holding doctrines in the country,
which were to put the king out of the system,
is it no evidence of intention with respect to
those who engaged in such projects jas I have
mentioned, that they do come to a resolution,
in which they declare that the law, question-
ing the propriety of declarations of that kind
amounts toa persecution, and that he ought to
be sustained against it?
Gentlemen, you will bear from witnesses,
who were present, what the proceedings on
the 20th of January, and the general com-
’ plexion and nature of them were. Mr. Mar-
tin being in the chair, and Mr. Hardy being
present, who wasa member of both these so-
cieties, an attending member in both of them,
I will give you Martin’s account of the pro-
ceeding on the 22d of January 1794, in a
letter in bis own hand-writing, sent to Mau-

_Tice Margarot,at Edinburgh, who bad advised
you will recollect, the London Corresponding
Society to come to sume strong resolutions—
who had urged that now is the time, that two
months in Scotland would do the business, pro-
vided they did their duty in England.

“ My dear sir, I dare say you think I have
forgot you from my not having written to
You, but you know my sentiments so well that
it ‘was unnecessary for me, and would proba-
bly have been improper to say much on the
subject of your mission’—then he states
something about private business.

“We had a meeting on Monday, I was in
the chair—the newspaper gives our numbers
at 500, but we were nearer 1,500: every thing
was well conducted, that is to say regularly,
and the proceedings were tolerably bold. Mr.
Hardy, | dare say, has sent you a copy of the
address and resolution.

“ Your conduct receives universal approba-
tion; and though I at one time dreaded the


who opposed the subscription at first, are now
putting their hands to the very bottom of their
pockets, and swear by God you shall be sup-
ported with the last guinea—we must have
another general meeting in a chapel, or some
large place, and declare the purpose of a sub-
scription, and I think we shall get plenty of
the needful:for that and other purposes. Have
you read my letter to lord —————? do you
incline to try the writ of error? what do the
Scotch lawyers think of it, and what do you
think of the legal knowledge of my country-
men? I firmly believe that the law is the
only science, of which they know nothing.

“The king went yesterday to meet Ais par-
liament’—so now we have got no parliament
of ours, the people of this country —“ they sat
till six o’clock this morning: the papers are
not out, but I am told only twelve members
were for peace: I am glad the minister has so
great a majority within doors for the war,
and that the people have a greater majority
without doors against the war: the swinish
rogues had the impudence to write ‘ No war’
on all the doors and corners of the Houses of
Lords and Commons, and they had even the
audacity to groan and hiss, while his most sa-
cred majesty was passing to and from the House
—nay | am told, a woman, moved and se-
duced by the instigation of the devil, and
traitorously intending, &c. did in St. James's
Park take off her patten, and threw it with all
her force at his majesty, whereby the glass of
the state coach was broken, and his majesty
putin fear: God save the king, for if, &c.—
as Gerrald says”—there he leaves it.

“ The society is increasing rapidly, both in
spirit and in numbers, and the richnow begin
to come among us, and to sit down with plea-
sure among the honest men with the leathern
aprons.

“TI could write to you strange things, but I
know not but this may be read by somebody
before it comes to your hands.”

Gentlemen, after this had passed, you will
find that that letter was written by the Cor-
responding Society to the Society tor Constie
tutional Informatiton (which I first mentioned
to you) upon the 27th of March 1794, and now
with your leave, I will read a part of .it to
you again.

“ T am directed by the London Correspond=
ing Socicty to transmit the following resolu-
tions to the society for Constitutional Infor-
mation.” I should tell you first, in the order
of time, that the society for Constitutional
Information distinctly adopt that paper of
the London Corresponding Society of the 20th
of January 1794, as their own, and order it to
be entered upon their books; they approve of
the manly sentiments of it, and they fully take
it to themselves, to all intents and purposes,
as if it had been a conjunct meeting of them
both. Then, the London Corresponding So-
ciety having held this- language respecting
the convention, and upon the 24th of J.

want of money, yet that is now over: those, | the Constitutional Society having adopted the

project of a convention stated in the address
of the London Corresponding Society of the
20th, and the nature of that convention being
acopvention from the atftiliated societies, to
take upon themselves the character of a con-
pention of the people, it would be surprising
indeed ifthe convention, which they speak of
on the 27th of March, should be a convention
of a different nature from that which they had
both agreed to on the 20th and 24th of Ja-
nuary—and with that observation I come
again to this letter of the 27th of March.

- “Tam directed by the London Correspond-
ing Society to transmit the following resolu-
tione tu the Society for Constitutional Infor-
mation, and to request the sentiments of that
society respecting the important measures
which the present juncture of affairs seems to
require. ‘The London Corresponding Society
eonceives that the moment is arrived”—-
throughout the years 1791, 1792, and 1793,
they thought it was not arrived—“ when a
full and explicitdeclaration is necessary from
all the friends of treedom—whether the late
illegal and unheard-of prosecutions and sen-
tences shall determine us to abandon our
cause, or shall excite us to pursue a radical re-
form, with an ardour proportioned to the mag-
nitude of the object, and with a zeal as distin-
guished on our parts, as the treachery of
others in the same glorivus cause is notorious.
The society for Constitutional Information is
therefore required to determine whether or no
they will be ready, when called upon, to act
in conjunction with this and other societies, to
obtain a tair representation of the people,
whether they concur with us in seeing the
necessity of a speedy convention for the pur-
pose of obtaining, in a constitutional and legal
method, a redress of those grievances under
which we at present labour.”

+ Now, in the first place, with respect to the
words “constitutional and legal method,”
‘these persons have not much to claim upon
the score of the effect and force of the words
‘£ constitutional and legal method,” which ap-
pear, through all their transactions of the
years 1792 and 1793, and more particularly
through the transactions of 1793, as they ap-
py to the British Convention, in Scotland, to

thought consistent with the existence of a
eonvention of such a character as that had;
and, if it was their purpose to have a conven-
tion of the people, by summonses to affiliated
societies, that convention to take upon itself
the power of the people, it is in vain that they
talk of legal and constitutional methods : it
is in vain, if the thing they mean to do, and
the manner of doing it, is not legal or consti-
tutional —Upon this letter, I apprehend, after
what has passed, there can be no doubt what
is meant bya convention: but it is not left
there: for in the third resolution they state,
that “there ought to be immediately 4 con-
vention of the people by delegates”—mark the
words—* deputed for that purpose from the
aifferent societies of the friends of freedom,


assembled in the various parts of this nation.’*

Then here is a convention of the same
character, of the same name, and the same
constitution, as that mentioned in the resolu-
tion of the 20th of January 1794. Now, to
whom is this proposed? It is proposed to
that Constitutional Society, which had adopted
the address of the 20th of January 1794, and
which had also said, by approving that address,
that they were of opinion that redress was not
to be obtained by the laws of England, but
that they were to have redress against their
oppressors, plunderers, and enemies, by their
own laws—by that sort of representation of
the people, which is formed by aconvention of
the people, summoned from those associated
societies. Then what follows upon it?—
though the thing is couched in phrases that
are a littleambiguous, yet no human being,
judging honestly, can doubt the meaning of
it; itis, that there shall be.this convention, to
act asa convention of the people, with the
power of the people, having or claiming all
eivil and political authority. The prisoner is
sufficiently involved oe if sucha conven-
tion never had been thought of; but then the
two societies form a committee of correspon-
dence and co-operation for the purpose of
bringing together that convention, which they
had gail was the only mean by which Britons
could enjoy their liberties, or protect them-
selves against the legitimate government of
the country, including 1n it their plunderers,
enemies, and oppressors.

Gentlemen, when I lay this evidence be-
fore you, if I stopped here, I should be glad
to learn why this is not a step taken for the
execution of such a purpose as I have before
stated—a step taken for constituting a body,
or a step taken towards devising the means of
constituting a body which was, lke the con-
vention mentioned in the speech of Barrére,
to supersede the legislature, to depose the
king, to suffer him to have no existence, but
what their good will and pleasure would
allow him, against the will, as the language of
the indictment states it, and im defiance of the
authority of the parliament—to depose the
king—for, if these people have the sovereign
power, and they must have the sovereign
power upon their own principles—the king of
England cannot have it in the manner in
which it is vested in him now. He was
bound to resist such a projectas this: he owed
it to every good subject in his country to
resist it— he was sworn to do it by the solemn
obligation of his coronation oath—you cannot
therefore contemplate a case of his acting
otherwise—the king being bound to resistance
for the security of the subject, and fur the
sake of observing his oath, for the sake of
continuing to reign according to the terms of
that oath, according to the statutes acreed
upon in parliament assembled, and the laws
and customs of the same.

But, gentlemen, I do not stop here: you
will also that there was a mecting at

Chalk Farm, the particulars of which I will
Not state farther than to say, that, when they
arg read, you will see that that meeting at
Chalk Farm was a step taken in the farther
prosecution of the functions of that committee
of co-operation—that it was a measure taken
for the express purpose of trying the temper
of the people, of seeing what they could do by
numbers. That meeting was held in April
1794, and it is very remarkable that it appears
that there were meetings in other parts of this
kingdom ; more particularly it appears from a
letter, found in the possession of this prisoner,
baa a there was a meeting in the open air at
Chalk Farm, so there were meetings elsewhere
—it required vigilance—it required the inter-
position of some strong hand, by parliament
or otherwise, to preserve you in the situation
in which you now are: if it be the will of
these persons that you shall not remain in it,
it is at least the duty of those, who are to
watch over the country as long as it can exist,
that it shall not be destroyed by any fault of
theirs: but you will find there were meetings
in the open air at Leeds, Wakefield, Hudders-
field, Bradford, Birstal, and at various other
laces. This project of a convention had
en communicated to many parts of the
country, and too many of them had assented
to it; not only assented to it, but it will be
proved, that the prisoner sent a circular letter
to the remotest parts of this kingdom (which
I willnow read), for the purpose of assembling
this convention, for the perpore of carrying
into effect the project of this British Conven-
tion, the body of which had been dissipated,
but which was still carrying on its purposes b
measures precisely the same as those whic!
had exist in this part of the island.
You will find that the prisoner writes this
circular letter to all those societies; and the
addressing this circular letter to all the socie-
ties, shows that the convention that was to be
called was not to be a convention of the
people at large, but a convention of delegates
summoned from those societies, to usurp the
character of “ a convention of the people.” —
“ The critical moment is arrived”—mark the
difference of language; in 1793 the time is not
yet come, men are not virtuous nor courageous
enough ; in 1792 they expected nothing from
parliament; in 1793, they expected every
thing from the societies in due time; and now
they assert that the due time is come, that the
Sulness of time is come—“ the critical moment
“$6 arrived, and Britons must either assert with
zeal and firmness their claims to liberty, ‘or
yield without resistance to the chains that
ministerial usurpation is forging for them.
Will you co-operate with us in the only peace-
able measure”—a very peaceable measure a
convention of this sort!—“ that now presents
itself with any prospect of success? We need
not intimate to you, that, notwithstanding the
unparalleled audacity of a corrupt and over-
bearing faction”—now this corrupt and over-

bearing faction is the King, Lords, and Gom-


mons of Great Britain—“ which at present
earnest on the rights and liberties of the
people; our peeing cannot in England be
interrupted without the previous adoption of a
convention bill.” A convention bill !—this
shows the reason for their resolutions in Scot-
land about permanent sittings, and the meet-
ing of another British Convention, and for
their language, which they held upon the.
20th of January 1794; “a measure it is our
duty to anticipate’—mark these words—“ our
duty to anticipate, that the ties of union may
be more firmly drawn, and the sentiments
and views of the different societies throughout
the nation be com "—What was their
object in this circular letter? If, when the
British Convention in Edinburgh sat, there
had been a motion for a convention bill in the
parliament of Great Britain, why, their object
was then, we perceive, that of being ready at
an hour’s warning; communicating in ali
parts of the kingdom to their delegates that
solemn resolution, which had been made im
the British Convention upon the 6th of
November; they were instantly, before the
project of such a bill could in parliament
ripen out of notice of a motion into a bill
once read, to be assembled in Edinburgh to
prevent any such bill passing; they solemnl
vowed to each other, hand in hand, and stan
ing up, to give the greater solemnity to the
declaration, “ that the moment such a bill as
that was introduced into parliament, they
would resist it at the hazard of their lives.”
Then what did they mean in this circular
letter ? they meant that, while as yet the bare
expectation of a convention bill might exist,
while, as yet, no notice of such a motion was
given or heard of in parliament—that it was
their duty to anticipate what parliament might
possibly think of. How to anticipate it?—to
anticipate it by means of a convention assum-
ing the character of a British Convention of
the people, but delegated from these societies,
to sit not at Edinburgh, but to sit at a place,
as yu will find, which they durst not name,
and for the purpose of conducting this project
with more security, as you find by this letter,
to sit at a place that was to be kept secret, in
order that the purpose might not be disa
pointed. ‘“ A measure,” they proceed, seis
ing of a convention bill, “it is our duty to
anticipate, that the ties of union may be more

rmly drawn, and the sentiments and views
of the different societies throughout the nation
be compared, while it is yet in our power, so
as to guide and direct the future operations of
the friends of freedom. Rouse then to one
exertion more, and let us show our conscious-
ness of this important truth; if we are to be
beaten down with threats, prosecutions, and
illegal sentences, we are unworthy, we are
incapable of liberty; we must, r, be exe
peditious ; Hessians and Austrians”—here is
the idea that came from Scotland again—
“are already amoung us, and if we tamely
submit, a cloud of these armed berbariens
Joy shortly be poured in upon us.”

The loprothaetion of sick men e this
eountry for the humane purpose of giving
them that air, which they could not obtain
while on board a ship, is made the pretext of
this letter for stating that “Hessians and
Austrians are already among us, and, if we
tamely submit, a cloud of these armed barba-
rians may be pace inupon us. Let us form
then another British Convention.” What was
that convention? they expressly state it to be
© convention of the people, and a convention,
which is to assume controlling powers over
the legislature. “‘ We have a central situa-
tion io our view, which we believe would be
most convenient for the whole island, but
which we forbear to mention (entreating your
confidence in this particular) till we have the
answer of”—whom ?—“ of the societies, with
which we are in correspondence.” What, is
that a convention of the people? or of the
societies assuming the character of a conven-
tion of the people? “Let us have your
answer then”—Now, give me leave to observe
how nearly this project was to being carried
into effect—“ Let us have your answer then
by the 20th at farthest, earlier, if possible,
whether hn approve of the measure, and how
many de bed you can send, with the num-
ber also, if possible, of your societies.”

Gentlemen, this will be proved to you to
have travelled as far as Strathaven, to have
been received there, and delegates to have
been appointed in consequence of the solicita-
tion ; and then, as in the British Convention,
in the month of November 1793, this great
project of calling together a body, which was
to put an end finally to the existence of parlia-
ment, was to be conducted by a secret com-
mittee ; because its operations, its assembling,
and the means which were to be taken for it,
could not be committed to numbers, a secret
committee was then appointed. This letter
ends—“ for the management of this business
we have sppomnied a secret committee: you
will judge how far it is necessary for you to do
thesame.”

Gentlemen, the next proceedings were at
Chaik Farm. In these proceedings, it appears,
they had stated to the Society called “ the
Friends of the People,” this measure of a
convention ; that measure the Friends of the
People refused to agree in. You will find
that, refusing to agree in that measure, at the
meeting at Chalk Farm, when it was stated
that the Society of the Friends of the People
would not agree in it—indeed, agree in it they
could not—you will find what was the recep-
tion, which the communication of that infor-
mation met with—an universal from a

body of men, amounting, I believe, to a
couple of thousand there assembled.
entlemen, this committee of correspon-
dence and co-operation, you will find, met;
you will find that there is in the hand-writing
of the prisoner, in avery short note, an ac-
count of what was done when they met; that
one of the first steps towards the accomplish-


ment of their purposes, was a communication

of the correspondences of the country societies

to those who were to be the delegates of the

Constitutional Society; but the meeting was’
broke up by the apprehension of the prisoner

and others, which has led, as I before stated,

to this prosccution.

Gentlemen, I have before told you that I
conceived it was competent for me, as indeed
1 apprehend without question it is, after prov-
ing the conspiracy, to show the conduct of the
persons, who were parties in that conspiracy,
in furtherance of the conspiracy, when it is
proved. You will find that one of the persons
who attended the meeting of the 20th of
January 1794, and who was a very active
member of the London Corresponding Society,
and likewise one of the committee of corres-
pondence and co-operation, which J have
alluded to as the final act of this business,
gives himself this account of the transactions
of the 20th of January 1794, and of other cir-
cumstances: this is Mr. Thelwall.

“ It is with infinite satisfaction that at last
I received a letter from you; it was brought
this morning by citizen Lee, and has been
delayed, I understand, this fortnight at Ro-
therhithe by some accident.

“T am too well acquainted with mankind
to be surprised, too much of a philosopher to
be angry at the abuse and misrepresentation
of mistaken men; but I shall endeavour, as
I wish to preserve the good opinion of a man
whom I remember with esteem, to send you
such printed documents as will prove to you
that, instead of having deserted the cause of
liberty, I have redoubled my zeal, and thas
there is not at this time in England a man
that goes bolder lengths, and exposes himself
to more danger, in the cause of liberty, tham
myself. I have been for four or five months
past almost the sole labourer upon whom the
fatigue, the danger, and the exertions of the
London Corresponding Societies, the only
avowed Sans Culottes in the metropolis, have
rested; and have been otherwise so active in
the cause, as scarcely to have passed a week
without threats and conspiracies from the
government and its purblind adherents.
Ever since the famous, or infamous, call it
which you will, proclamation of November,
1792, I have been frequenting all public
Meetings where any thing could be done or
expected, have been urging and stimulatin
high and lew, and endeavouring to rally an
encourage the friends of freedom. I have
been constantly sacrificing interest and secu-
rity, offending every personal advantageous
connexion, till ministerialists, oppositionists,
and moderees, hate me with equal cordiality, _
and, if I may judge by their conduct, fear
me as much as they hate. ..

“ For these four months, I have been giving
political lectures and gr and appropri-
ating the whole receipts, till the last fortnight,
to the support of our delegates to the British *
Convention ; for the history of which I must

refer you to citizen Talbot, whom I have not
seen tat whom I hope to see before he leaves
England.” .

e then gives an account of the meetings
T have been stating to you, and of his lectures:
then he says,

“ Adieu. I will collect together what po-
litical papers ‘I can, to send to you when I
can find leisure. Do write to me; let me
know something aboat the state of politics and
society in America. I fear you are somewhat
short of the true Sans Culutte liberty ; that you
have too much veneration for property, too
much religion, and too much law.”

“T fear you are somewhat short of the true
Sans Culotte liberty.” Now, that is, that you
have too much veneration for property, too
meh religion, and too much law.

Gentlemen, having now gone through
the written evidence, I am to state to you
some other circumstances. I have not indeed
stated all the written evidence, because you
will have written evidence laid before you of
stimulations, under singular pretexts, to these
societies, to arm themselves. You will find,
that parliament, where they meant hereafter
to suffer no debate, about the Hessians and
Hanoverians, they circulated among them
papers, and it will be brought home to those
‘with respect to whom it is stated, to this effect
— The ins tell us we are in danger of in-
svasion from the French ; the outs tell us that
‘we are in danger from the Hessians and Ha-
noverians: ineither case, we should arm our-
selves. Get arms, and leam how to use
shem.”

You will likewise find, upon this part of
the ease, that, after the dispersion of the Bri-
‘ish Convention in Edinburgh, after it was
teen that the law of this country was strong
enough to beat down .a conspiracy of that
kind, acting by their mere naked numbers,
that it became then, in their opinion, neces-
sary to the accomplishment of their purpose,
to act with arms. :

Now, pentlemen, where a general conspi-
racy of this sort, among affiliated societies,
existed in Scotland, Sheffield, Norwich, Man-
chester, smd various parts of the king-
‘dom, all aiming at the same end, all acting
upon the same principle, all involved in
‘the same project of having a convention
from the different parts of the united king-
doms, it is natural that they should think of
arms: but, if the eonspiracy did not exist,
it would seem a very odd thing that it
should happen in fact, that, in these different

rts of the kin;
‘field, and in London, we should find persons
‘preparing arms of a sort, and of a denomi-
nation, which of late years we have not heard
of in this country, except as existing in France,
and except as stated in a letter from France,
which I have read to you.

But, gentlemen, Bo will find, from the
evidence I have to offer, and indeed it is not
e

lom, in Scotland, in Shef. |


snprisips that you should so find—after I
shall tell you, that in the pocket of one of the
parties in this conspiracy, and distributed also
in divisions in the London Corresponding So-
ciety, were papers, importing that upon the
1st of April, 1794, was to be periirrmesh, The
Guillotine, or George’s Head in = Basket ;”
papers in which the sacred person of the king
1s so spoken of, and in which all orders of
men, under ludicrous representations of them
to their country, were doomed te lamp-irons,
and to suspension ; after I shall tell you, that
I am instructed that Mr. Thelwall could,
when retiring from Chalk-farm, take a pot of
peer in his hand, with a knife take off the

ead, and say, “ Thus I would serve all
kings ;” if you should find such language
used, I am persuaded you widl not be surprised
to find pikes in the hands of these men and
their associates—to find muskets in the hands
of these men and their associates. Do not,
gentlemen, let us be misled by the great doc-
trine of the Bill of High that every man
has a right to arms for his own protection—
he has without question a right to convenient
arms for his own defence; but the point be-
fore a jury will be, for what purpose had he
the arms? If he attempts to say that he
had them for his own defence—if had he
them in fact for a worse purpose, the attempt
to colour the tact makes the fact more cri-
minal.

Gentlemen of the jury, you will find that
Mr. Yorke, in the month of November 1793,
will be proved to have been at one of the di-
visions of the London Corresponding Society,
stating, that he was going among the sons of
liberty into Belgium, to bring into this coun=
try the true friends of liberty. You will find
that he was a member of the Landon Cortes-
pending Society, and constituted a delegate
of the Constitutional Soeiety to Scotland ;
that he has been propagating at Sheffield the
same doctrine, as his brother associates were
propagating in London: that he was there
directing the form in which pikes should be
made, to persons who were to make such in-
struments; that the persons at Sheffield enter
into a correspondence with the prisoner at
the bar; that they inform him that these
pikes are made; that he delivers the direc-
tion to persons of the Corresponding Society,
in order that they may furnish themselves
with these instruments ; and that they were
to be furnished from Sheffield to a place here,
I think, the Parrot, ix Green Arbour alley,
or some other place in this town; and that,
if the apprehension of these persons here, and
at Shetheld, had not put an ead to the farther
execution of the project, there would have
been a large apron of these pikes into
this part of the kingdom.

Gentlemen, you will find that this idea of
arms was carried farther; you will find that,
for the use of this society, a plate with figures,
showing the manner of learning the military
exercise, was engraved by a Mr. Worship, a

member of this society. You will find that
there was a military society in Lambeth, and
another in Turnstile, Holborn; they were
small in their beginnings, I admit; but these
things must be so in their beginnings; and
you will find, that the prisoner at the bar

ve'to a witness of the name of Edwards, a

jirection of whom to obtain pikes at Sheffield.
Mr. Williams; another witness, who will be
called to you, who is a gun-engraver in the
Tower, made muskets for the use of these so-
cieties in Lambeth, and in Turnstile, with an
express protest that he should not be em-
ployed, unless he himself became a member
of the societies. You will find accordingly
that he did become a member of them. You
will find that they drilled at particular places.
Gentlemen, I give you this outline of this
part of the evidence, because I do not wish
to enter more into the particulars, than to
give you a general impression of the nature
of the case which I have to lay before you.

You will likewise see, what is natural
enough to happen, when you find in the book
of the Society for Constitutional Information,
that Mr. Horne Tooke could think of giving
notice, that he would move “ that two books
should be vpened, one of them (bound in
black) in which should be entered all the
enormities of those who deserve the censure ;
and in the other, the merits of those who de-
serve the gratitude of the society.” You will
not be surprised, if you should find persons
in these affliated societies, of lower descrip-
tions, holding conversations about seizing the
Most august persons in the nation; if you
should hear of their holding conversations
about the situation of persons in the House
of Commons, and the means by which they
could know their persons.

Upon the whole, gentlemen of the jury, I
shall now lay the testimony before you, sub-
mitting this written evidence to you, calling
witnesses, above all exception, to a great part
of the case; calling some witnesses, whom I
now avow to you, you will find, were persona
employed by government to watch over the
proceeslings of these societies, and who there-
‘ore became informed, in consequence of such
employment, of some of their transactions;
and government would have been wanting to
itself, and would have been wanting to a degree
of criminality, which no man_ can describe, if
this country had at this moment been in the
state in which it would have been, if these
pikes had been brought into actual exertion.

At Sheffield, indeed, I am told they had got
to the length of forming iron instruments,
which were to disable horse, which they call-
ed night-cats, and which would immediately
insert themselves into the hoofs of horses
feet. I say, if, with these projects going on
im the country, a secretary of stute, or any
other person in the executive government,
had hesitated a moment to procure informa-
tion, these parties might have been able to
put into execution the projects they were me-



pighng. and he would have been answerable
for it.

Gentlemen, it-is the great province of a
British jury, and God forbid these prisoners
should not have the benefit of the reflection,
that British juries are able to protect us all—
are able to sift the characters of witnesses—
to determine what credit is due to them—lis-
tening to men of good character without any
impression against their evidence—listening
to men, such as I have stated, with a strong
impression against their evidence ; that im-
pression, however, to be beat down by the
concurrent unsuspicious testimony arising
out of the rest of the case, if, upon the whole

ou shall find the case to be made out as I
ave stated it to you. :

Gentlemen, I torgot to mention to you, that
you will likewise find, about the time that this
convention was talked of, that there was a
new constitution framed for the Correspon-
ding Society, in which they speak of a royal-
ist as an enemy to the liberties of his country
—of a democrate, as a friend to the liberties
of his country; and you will find, that, ina
constitution again revised, the whole was
thrown into a scheme, and into a system,
which was to add physical strength to the
purposes of that convention, which was, I sub-
mit to you, to assume all civil and political au-
thority.

Tf you find all these things, and, if under
the direction of that wisdom that presides
here, with respect to which, gentlemen, let
me say again, that the situation of this coun-
try is indeed reduced to a most miserable one,
if the respect, which is due to the adminis-
tration of the law, is suffered to be weakened
in any manner, if the respect, which is due to
the administration of the law, that adminis-
tration, which perhaps is the best feature of
the constitution under which we live, is de-
stroyed, miserable indeed must be the situa-
tion of your country! If you’ find under that
direction that the case, being proved in fact,
is also made out in law, you will do that on
behalf of the public which is due to yourselves,
to the public, to your posterity, and theirs.

But on the other hand, if, after hearing
this case fully stated, and attempted to be
fully proved, you should be of opinion that it
is not proved, or you should be finally of opi-
nion that the offence is not made out ac
cording to the Aallowed interpretation of the
statute of Edward 3rd; I say then, in the
conclusion, I pein. from my heart, in the
prayer which the law makes on behalf of the
prisoner, God send the prisoner a safe deli-
verance !

“To the secretary of the Society for Con-
stitutional Information.

“ March 27, 1794,

“ Citizen;—I am directed by the London
Corresponding Society to transmit the follow-
ing resolutions to the Society for Constitu-
‘tional Information, and to request the senti-
‘ments of that society respecting the impor-
tant measures which the present juncture of
affairs seems to require. The London Cor-
responding Society conceives that the moment
‘is arrived when a full and explicit declaration
is necessary from all the friends of freedom,
‘whether the late illegal and unheard-of pro-
secutions and sentences shall determine us to
abandon our cause, or shall excite us to pur-
sue a radical reform with an ardour propor-
tioned to the magnitude of the object, and
.with a zeal as distinguished on our parts as
the treachery of others in the same glorious
cause is notorious; the Society for Constitu-
tional Information is therefore required to de-
termine whether or no they will be ready,
when called upon,.to act in conjunction with
this and other societies, to obtain a fair repre-
sentation of the people ; whether they concur
with us in seeing the necessity of a speedy
convention, for the purpose of obtaining, in a
constitutional and legal method, a redress of
those grievances under which we at present
labour, and which can only be effectually re-
moved by a full and fair representation of the
people of Great Britain, The London Cor-


responding Society cannot but remind their
friends, that the present crisis demands all
the prudence, unanimity, and vigour, that
ever was or can be exerted by men and Br-
tons; nor do they doubt but that manly
firmness and consistency will finally, and,
they believe, shortly terminate in the full ae-
complishment of all their wishes. I am, fe-
low citizen (in my humble measure) a
friend to the rights of man,
“T, Harpy, Secretary.

“ Resolved unanimously,. 1. That, dear as
justice and liberty are to Britons, yet the va
lue of them is comparatively small without a
dependence on their permanency, and there
can be no security for the continuance of any
right but in equal laws. .

“ 2, That equat laws can never be expected
but by a full and fair representation of the peo-
ple ; to obtain which, in the way pointed out by
the constitution, has been and is the sole object
of this society ;. for this we are ready to hazard
every thing, and never but with our lives will
we relinquish an object which involves the
happiness, or even the political existence, of
ourselves and posterity. .

“3, That it is the decided opinion of this
society, that to secure ourselves from future
feed: and scandalous prosecutions; w pre-
vent a repetition of wicked and unjust se
tences, and to recall those wise and wholesome
laws that have been wrested from us, and of
which scarcely a vestige remains, there ought
to be immediately a convention of the people,
by delegates deputed for that purpose from
the different societies of the friends of free-
dom, assembled in the various parts of this
nation, and we pledge ourselves to the pub-
lic to pursue every legal method speedily
accomplish so desirable a purpose.

“Postscript. I have to inform you, that 4
general meeting of the society will be holdea
on Monday the 14th of April, the place to be

[The paper read.]

“A parliamentary reform is that which
of allother things, in our opinion, deserves
the attention of the public. We are more
and mure convinced, by every day’s experi-
ence, that the restoring the right of voting
universally to every man, not incapacitat
by nature, for want of reason, or by law for

commission of crimes (together with an-
Dual elections) is the only reform that can be
effectual and permanent. . As Providence has
kindly furnished men in every station with

faculties necessary for judging of what con- | y

cerns themselves, it is somewhat strange that
the multitude should suffer a few, with no
better intellects than their own, to vsuxr the

iaportant power of governing them without

control, i


“Tt has has been a long and very just com-
plaint, that a very great majority of the peo- .
ple of this country are not represented in par-
iament; that the majority of the representa-
tives of the whole nation are chosen b
number of voters not exceeding twetve t
sand, Many large and populous towns have
not a single vote for a representative, such as
Birmingham, containing about 40,000 inha-
bitants, Manchester above 30,000, Leeds
above 20,000, besides Sheffield, Bradford,
Wolverhampton, Halifax, &c. &c. ‘

“Let us look at the metropolis, and sce
what a great majority of the inhabitants have
not a single vote. Those facts are solid evi-
dences, therefore need no comment. The
views and intentions of this society are to col-’
lect the opinion and know the determination
(as far as possible) of the aacirepresente of the
people, They certainly are the persons most
aggrieved, and have the greatest right to come
forward like men, and say—Give us our
Ricats ; and, if they arc united and firm,
where or who are they that dare oppose
them in their determinations? :

~¢ From these considerations we have come
to the following RESOLUTIONS :

“4, That a society be instituted under the
title of the Corresponding Society, for restor-
ing the right of the unrepresented people of
Great Britain.

“g, That each member shall pay at least
one penny per week ‘towards the expense of
the society.

“ 3, That as soon as twenty members shail
be associated, a general meeting shall be call-
ed, at which the laws and regulations neces-
sary for the overnment of the society
shall be esta lished, and such officers appoint-'
ed as may be thought necessary.—[This reso-
lution was struck out.)

“4, That a committee be appointed ‘to
correspond with any and every society that
may be formed in Great Britain, with a view
of promoting the objects of this society.

“5, That no person shall be proposed to be
a member of this society (after the first gene-
ral. meeting) unless he be recommendcd by
one member, and the proposal seconded by
another.—[ ‘This resolution was struck out.

“ 6. That-each member’s name and place
of abode be entered regularly ina book kept
fur that purpose. . ;

7, That all proceedings of the society and’
its committee be fairly transcribed into . pros.

er books for.that purpose, by the secretary,
rom the rough minutes, against the next
meeting of the society and committee. .

4©g, That no one be admitted a member
under the age of twenty-one years, nor any
who has not resided in Great Britain for one
ear.”

Mr. Shelton.—This follows in another hand.
“The society divided into dozens, not to
exceed twenty. New members. to be ad-
mitted in each division of the society by a
majority. When seven members are present, -

address and resolutions to the Society for a Re-
form of Parliamentary Representation at Edin-
burgh ; likewise I have to inform you of their
wish to enter into correspondence, and be in
close connexion with your suciety : as our cause
isone, our sentiments ought to be known to
each other, and act with one heart in a matter
of such vast importance. We began this so-
ciety last January; and, since we published
our declaration and resolutions, we have in-
creased so rapidly in number and respecta-
bility, that we were under the necessity of
dividing into different companies to meet at
separate houses, and each division sends a
delegate to meet as a committee, to transact
the business of the whole society, The in-
dorsed papers will inform you more fully of
the principles we set out upon. Be so good
as to deliver them to the president or secre-
tary of your society. As I know you to bea
friend of freedom, you will endeavour to pro-
Tavte a union between the two societies; for,
by uniting together, we shall become stronger,
and a three-fold cord is not easily broken,—I

« Assured that man, individual man, may
justly claim liberty as his birthright, we na-
turally conclude that, as a member of society,
it becomes his indispensable duty to preserve
inviolate that liberty for the benefit of his
fellow citizens, and of his and their posterity.

« For, as in associating, he gave up certain
of his rights, in order to secure the possession
of the remainder, and polunterily yielded up
only as much as was necessary for the ral
goud—so he may not barter away the liberties
of his posterity, nor desert the common cause
by tamely and supinely suffering to be pur-
loined from the people of whom he makes a
part, their natural and unalienable nicuTs oF
RESISTANCE TO OPPRESSION, and Of SHARING
IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THEIR COUNTRY ;
without the full and uninterrupted exercise of
which ricuts, no man can with truth call
himself or his couatry free.

“ Yet of late, the very men who have dared
to oppress the nation, have also dared to ad-
vance, that edf resistance to their oppression is
illegal; while on the other hand, rraup or
FORCE, sanctioned by custom and blind sub-
mission, has withdrawn, and now withholds,
from a very great majority of the tax-paying,
industrious, and useful inhabitants of Great
Britain, the arcu of sharing in the govern-

the management of their own interests.

“The few who are now permitted to elect re-
presentatives, and those who are chesen by this
small number of electors, disgrace the country at
large by buying and selling votes, by corrupting
re being corrupted—the former by their
behaviour at elections, and the latter by their
conduct in the senate—more than sufficient
to prove, that THE NATION IS UNREPRESENTED,
and that THE PRESENT SYSTEM JS TOTALLY
uNconstTITuTIoONAL—if by the word conetitue
tion, any thing is meant.

“ Roused at last from their torpor, and
i god remedy the evil,—various, numerou:
and respectable societies have been form
by the peuple, in different parts of the kings
dom, several have also arisen in the metro
polis; and among them the London Corres-
ponding Society, with modesty, but with firm.
ness, claim the attention of their country to
the following resolutions ;

& Resolved,

* J, That every individual has a right to
share in the government of that society of
which he is a member-—unless incapacitated.

“ II. That nothing but nonage, privation
of reason, or an offence against the general
laws of society, can incapacitate him.

“ III. That it is no Jess the riont than the
puty of every citizen to keep a watchful eye
on the government of his country, that the -
Jaws by being multiplied do not degenerate
into oppressiwn; and that those who are
entrusted with the government, do not sub-
stitute privute interest for public advantage.

“ IV, That the people of Great Britain
are not effectually represented in parliament.

“ V. That in consequence of a partial, un-
equal, and therefore inadequate representation,
together with the corrupt method in which
representatives are elected; oppressive taxes,
unjust laws, restrictions of liberty, and mgsting

the public money, have nuied.

* VI. That the only remedy to those evils,
is a fair, equal, and impartial representation
of the people jn parliament. .

“ VII. That a fair, equal, and impertial re-
presentation tan never take place untill alt
partial privileges are abolished.

“ VIII. That this society do express their
abhorrence of tumult and violence---aiming
at reform, not anarchy-—reason, firmness,
and unanimity, are the only arms they
themselves will employ, or persuade their
fellow citizens to exert, against ABUSE OF
rOwER.—-Signed by order of the committee,

“T, Harpy, secretary.
“ April ed, 1799.”
“ The London Corresponding Society to the

Nation at large.

«“ Whereas it is notorious, that very nu-
merous, burthensome, and unnecessary taxes
are laid on the ns and families of us
and others, the industrious inhabitants of
Great Britain, an exceedingly great mejority

of whom are, notwithstanding, excluded
from all representation in parliament.

- And as upon inquiry into the cause of
this grievance, which is at once an obstruc-
tion to our industry, and diminution of our
property, we find that the constitution of our
country (which was purchased for us at the
expense’of the lives of our ancestors) has, hy
the violence and intrigue of criminal and de-
signing men, been injured and undermined
in its most essential and important parts: but
particularly in the House of Commons, where
the whole of the supposed representation of
the people is neither more nor less than an
usu power, arising either from abuses in
the mode of election and duration of parlia-
ments, or from a corrupt property in certain
decayed corporations, by means of which the
liberties of this nation are basely bartered
away for the private profit of members of

liament.

“ And as it further appears to us, that until
this source of corruption shall be cleansed by
the information, perseverance, firmness, and
union of the people at large, we are robbed
of the inheritance so acquired for us by our
forefathers: and that our taxes, instead of
nang lessened, will go on increasing: inas-
much as they will furnish more bribes, places,
and pensigns to our minister and members of
parliament.

“It being resolved by us, the members of
this society, to unite ourselves into one firm
and permanent body, for the purpose of in-
forming ourselves and others of the exact state
of the present parliamentary representation—
for obtaining a peaceful but adequate remedy
to this intolerable grievance—and for corres-
ponding and co-operating with other societies
united for the same objects, the following
regulations for the internal order and govern-


sion shall divide again, til it amount to
double such number of members; at which
time notice shall be given to the committee
of delegates hereafter mentioned, by the them
delegates of such division.

«Fourthly. That each division shall meet
weekly, on any evening (Thursday excepted)
at some house to be chosen by themselves,
and appoint a chairman for the Bas order
thereof; and also shatl name a delegate as
hereafter mentioned. .

“ Fifthly. That each member shall pay te
the secretary‘of his division one penny per
week, or one shilling and a penny per quarter;
which shall be credited to the account of
such member in a book to be kept for that
purpose. That all mony paid shall be
transmitted monthly, by delegate of such’
division, to the treasurer, who is to account
.with the body of delegates for the same, on-
the four usual quarter-days.

“ Sixthly. ‘That the sums so paid to the
said treasurer shall form one commen stock,
to be applied by ‘the said delegates in the
postage of letters, in stationary, and in print-
Ing such matters as may be good for the im-
formation of the society. But that before any
expense whatever shall be incurred, the said
delegates shall inquire of the treasurer what
balance he has in hand.

*Seventhly. That the delegates so ap-
pointed shall meet on Thursday in every
week, and shall continue in office for three
months; subject, however, to be recalled or
superseded by their several divisions befgre
the expiration of that time, if thought neces-
sary. ‘That being assembled, they shall name

“Eighthly. That sueh delegates so as-
sembled, shall in the first place communicate

adopted:

“First. That every person, before he is
admitted, shall be proposed by two members,
and shall answer in the affirmative to the
three following questions, viz.

“ Question . Are you convinced that the
parliamentary representation of this country
is at present inadequate and imperfect ?

_“Q. 11. Are you thoroughly persuaded that
the welfare of these kingdoms requires thot
every person of adult years, in possession of his
reason, and not incapacitated by crimes, should
have a vote for a member of parliament ?

“Q, TIL. Will you endeavour, by all jus-
tiftable means, to promote such reformation in
parliament ?

“ Secondly. That the whole body shall go |
under one common name of the Londox Cor-
responding Society, united for the reform of
parliamentary Representorign.

“Thirdly. That for the more easy and
orderly-proceeding of the society, it be sepa- .
rated into as many divisions as there shall be '
thirty members to make up the number re- |

quisite for such division, And that no divi- i

the wishes of their several divisions, relative
to any objects of the society. Thatthey shall
be authorized to answer any correspond
which may require immediate attention ; an
afterwards, that each delegate shall report the
same to his respective division. Also, that
they shaH consider of the general state of the
society: but shall .on no account publish any
new principle, or set of principles, until the
same shall be approved by a majority of the
individual members of the society at large.

“Ninthly. That it shall be necessary for
two-thirds of the said socesiet to form a
committee for the dispatch of business. And,

“Tenthly. That these resulutions and
regulations be printed for the members of the
society, and that a copy be given to cach
member on his admission.

“ Maurice Marcarot, chairman. *

. “ Tuomas Harpy, secretary.”

“ Forasmuch as it is possible that the
grounds of our complaint may be denied, and
that our views and principles may be misre-
presented, we desire that every one will seri-
ously consider and treasure in his memory
the state of scandalous facts which follow.—

Let him then ask himself, whether it be the
art of a good citizen to sit quiet under such
abuses, which have not only increased, but
are at this moment increasing; and which
ought therefore to be remedied without delay.
“Till the reign of Henry Gth it was not
necessary for the inhabitant of a county to
have a freehold estate of 40s. a year, in order
to vote for the representative of his county.
But the statute of that king, passed in the
year 1429, under pretence of preventing dis-
putes at elections, most unjustly deprived a
t_part of the commons of this nation of
the right of consenting to those taxes which,
moiwithstanding, they were compelled to
pay, just as if such right had not been taken
them.

“ Till the reign of queen Anne, is was not
pecessary for the inhabitant of a county to
have 600/. a year, freehold or copyhold estate,
in order to his being elected the representa-
tive of his county. But the statute of that
queen, posed in the year 1710, under pre-
tence of the freedom of parliament, excluded

* all persons not possessed of such a property
from our representation, whatever be their
principles, their abilities, or their integrity.

“© Till the reign of William Srd parliaments
were of gicur to be called once a year, or of-
tener ifneed be. Butthe statute of that king,
passed in the year 1694, under pretence of
calling them more frequently, enacted, that
they should be holden once in three yeurs at
the least.

“ Till the reign of George 1st, parliaments
were therefore of three years duration. But
the statute of that king, passed in the year
1715, under pretence of a ‘restless faction’
then existing in the nation, usurped a power
of enacting, that ‘ parliament should respec-
* tively have continuance for seven years.’

. “As for the supposed representation of
the people, which 1s called the ‘ Commons
« of England in Parliament assembled ;’

“The county of Cornwall contains in
itself alone the privilege of sending forty-four
members to parliament, which is just one
less in number than those of the whole
kingdom of Scotland, containing upwards of
three millions of people.

“ Of these forty-four supposed representa-
tives, two are elected by the frecholders of
the county: the rest sit for twenty-one corpo-
ration towns; of which

“ To these we might add, of the same de-

electors, which send 56 members to that
House of Commons, which is so frequently
and so falsely called the democracy of the
nation; while the towns of Shetheld, Man-
chester, Birmingham, Leeds, Wolverhampton,
&c. containing above three hundred thousand

people, have no electors or representatives
whatever.

“ Upon the whole it appears, that 257
supposed representatives of the People
making a majority of the House of Com-
mons, are returned by a number of voters,
not exceeding the thousandth part of the

nation.

“ But as Providence has aul furnished
men, in every station, with faculties neces-
sary for judging of what concerns themselves,
shall we, the multitude suffer a few, with no
better right than ourselves, to usurp the
power of governing us without control?
Surely not'!—Let us rather unite in one
common cause, to cast away our bondage;
being assured, that in so doing, we are pro=
tected by a jury of our countrymen, while we
are discharging a duty to ourselves, to our
country, and to mankind.

« Ordered that the secretary of the society,
do transmit copies of the above to all the
societies in the nation, engaged in the same
cause. :

“ London, May 24, 1792.”

“ Address from the London Corresponding:
Society, to the Inhabitants of Great-
Britain, on the subject of a Parliamentary
Reform,

“ Fellow Citizens,—Of every rank and
of every situation in life, rich, poor, high or
low; we address you all as our brethren, on
a subject of the highest importance, and most
intimately connected with the welfare of every
individual who deems liberty a blessing, who
partakes in the prosperity of his country, and
who wishes to transmit as much of either as
he possibly can, to posterity.

“ Uninfluenced by party pique or selfish
motives—no ways affrighted at the frowns of
power—not in the least awed by the evi-
dently hostile preparations of a much alarmed
aristocracy, we, the London Corresponding
Society, united with a view of obtaining a
Tuoroucn PariraMentary RerorM, anxi-
ously demand your serious and most col-
lected attention to the present vitraTED
state of the British government, we entreat

*

you to examine coolly and impartially the
Numerous abuses that prevail therein, their
destructive consequences on the poor, and
their evil tendency on all; as also the rapi-
dity with which these abuses increase both
in number and magnitude. :

“ We next submit to your examination an
effectual mode of putting a stop to them, and
of thereby restoring to our no less boasted
than impaired constitution, its pristine vigour
and punty: and we thereunto warmly solicit
the junction of your efforts with ours.

“This great end however we believe at-
tainable, solely, by the whole nation deeply
impressed with a sense of its wrongs, uniting,
ane as it were with one voice demanding of
those to whom fur a while it has entrusted
its sovereignty, a restoration of, annuALLY
ELECTED PaRLIAMENTS, UNBIASSED AND UN-
BouGut ELEctIoNs, AND AN EQUAL Repre-
SENTATION OF THE Wuoitr Bopy oF THE
Pzopte.

“ Leaving to the enemies of freedom, all
violent, tumultuous, and unconstitutional pro-
ceedings, we invite you to. peaceful, well-
regulated, and neighbourly meetings, wherein
Sealtatcods worthy citizens may as honest
men, as good patriots, in a reasonable and
sensible manner, laying aside prejudice, seri-
ously and earnestly take into consideration
their rights, and the welfare of the present
and succeeding generations.

“« As men can never barter away the rights
of their posterity —as eneroachmentson liberty
or property cease not to be grievances from
their being customary and of Jong stenting
and ag a grievance is not the less felt for being
denied by those who cause it—fceling griev-
ances enormous,—seeing our liberties en-
croached upon and endeavoured to be entirely
purloined from us—as also that our plaints
are derided by government, and ourselves
unlawfully menaced by. those in power, we
call upon you all, Britons, to remember your
privileges as such, and to assert your rights as
men—to pay all proper regard to your native
freedom; and to consider that, being the pro-
perty of no man, nor of any set of men, it is

ighly disgraceful for you to suffer yourselves
any longer te be thus enslaved and disposed
of as cattle in a fair, as irrational beasts in a
market, to the highest bidder.

“ Laying aside all pretensions to originality,
we claim no other merit than that of reconsi-
dering and verifying what has already been
urged in our common cause by the duke of
Richmond, Mr. Pitt, and their then honest
party, years back; now differing from them,
we support with candour and zeal (thereby
op ourselves no courtiers) the banner ef |
truth already displayed against the oppressors
of mankind, and we take a pride in acknow-
ledging ourselves a part of that useful class of |
citizens-whioh placemen (pensioned with the

extorted produce of our daily labour) and proud
nobility wallowing in riches (acquired some-
how) affect to treat with a contempt too de-


grading for human nature te bear, unless
reconciled to it by the reflection, that, though
their inferiors in rank and fortune, we equal
them in talents, and excel them in honesty.
“ Still, friends and fellow citizens, possessed
of souls far superior to the evil spirit influenc-
img these oppressors, these debasers of man-
kind; instead of hating, we contemn them ;
and our motive is not vengeance, but redress.
“ A constitution we are said to possess, we
are willing to believe it—if good, it allows
redress to 2 complaining people—if excellent,
as many assert, it must naturally point out the
means thereof. Let it therefore be publicly
and carefully examined—if it is really what it
ought to be, it cannot be too well: known; if
faulty, it cannot be too soon amended; nor
can that be done by a more competent jud:
the arte

than the thus collected sense o!
nation.

“Tt is the right of every individual to be
well acquainted with the laws that bind him !
but how is the peasant, the mechanic, the
manufacturer, to obtain that necessary know-
ledge ; his time fully employed in labouring
hard to provide a scanty meal for his family,
and in earning wherewith to satisfy the
frequent and peremptory demands of surly
tax-gatherers, he has no leisure for suc
intricate political researches ; and even was
he, by stealing that leisure from his labour or
his sleep, to acquire the desired insight—still
with spirits depressed by his suffering, with
fears increased by the clamorous threats of
the pensioned all-devouring locusts in office,
the sore-oppressed subject feels the remedy
to be far out of his reach, and dreads the con-
sequence of being even supposed to know how
greatly he is wronged:—Such being the forlorn
situation of three-fourths of the nation, how’
are Britons to obtain information and redress?
Will the court, will ministry, afford either?
Will parliament grant them? Will the nobles
or the clergy ease the peopte’s suffering? No.
Experience tells us, and' proclamations confinn
it, that the interest and the intention of power
are combined to keep the nation in torpid
ignorance!

“ The only resource then, friends and feHow
citizens, vill | be found in those societies which,
instituted with a view to the public good, pro-
mote a general instruction of our rights as
men, expose the abuses of those in power,
and point out the only constitutional, the
only effectual means of forwarding a public
investigation, and obtaining a complete re-
dress for a people in whose credulous good
nature originated their present difficulties.

We will not hurt your feelings by a minute
detail of our common grievances; you cannot
be ignorant, friends and fellow sufferers, how
generally power, place, pension, and'title, are
the rewards uf men whose services to the
court have been of the greatest prejudice to
the country. You painfully feel the conse-
quences; increased taxes, a great part of .
which are most vilely squandered; a heavy

national debt, begun With a design of forming

& powerful and monied court-party ; conti-

tued with nearly the same view, unto its

ptesent enormous bulk, and from its com-
mencement militating against our liberties!
Too visible are the numerous encroachments
on our rights, too common the insolence of
office, the venality of magistracy, the perver-
éion of the laws, the letting loose the military
on every occasion, and those occasions eagerly
sought. The subject’s complaints derided—the
one part of the nation turned into spies and
informers against the other—the—but where-
fore more? Is here not enough to prove
beyond a doubt, that while we boast the best
constitution, the mildest laws, the freest
government, we are in fact slaves !
“ Yet, fellow citizens ! numerous as are our
gieences and close rivetted as weighty to
shackles on our freedom; reform one
alone, and the others will all disappear. If
we once regain an anually elected parliament,
and that parliament to be fairly chosen by all,
the | tga will again share in the government
of their country, and their then unbought,
unbiassed 8 must undoubtedly select a
majority of honest members, while the very
few unsound ones, that may accidentally
obtain seats, will, from the consideratiun of
their annual dependance on the people, think
it highly advisable to continue the disguise
that procured them their election, and at least
wear the mask of honesty—a mask neither at
all times necessary, nor at all times worn, in
&septennial parliament.
_ “ Let no man imagine himself unconcerned
in the proposed reform—let no one think so
meanly of his situation or abilities, as to sup-
pose his coming forward will be of no service
to the cause of liberty! numbers, union, and
Perseverance must in the end be crowned
with success, while compared with the small
efforts of each individual associating and
thereby countenancing the demand of the

educated, prisons less crowded, old age better

not upon this, dear countrymen, as an

enthusiastic vision; but rather let us together

take a calm and reasonable review of such an

liament assembled—let us in idea

amtail their session unto even the short dura-


tion of thtee months in one year, of sixty-foor
meetings for doing the annual business of the
nation. Still five hundred honest men, meet-
ing sixty-four times, with both intention aid
capacity to serve their country, must do some-
thing——ust employ their tinfe somehow.
Contested elections, none or very few, and
soon determined ; party debates, none, the in-
terest of the people being one; long speeches .
much diminished, honest men seeking reason
not oratory; no placemen in the senate, cor-
rupt influence dies away, and with it all

ious, obstinate, ministerial opposition to
measures calculated fer the publi¢ good: de-
testing chicanery, oppression and injustice of
every kind, this honest parliament, findin;
that the laws wanted simplification a
arrangement, would set about it, however
destructive their labours might prove to the
sordid interest of art ambitious judge, a prosti-
tuted council, a packed jury, or a vile herd of
pettyfoggers, trading justices, bailiffs, or rune
ne!

-“ Finding that a most extraordinary waste
of public money had taken place under the
different pretences of places, pensions, ¢on-
tracts, armaments, subsidies, secret service
money, &c. our honest and annual parliament
would, after narrowly scrutinizing the same,
retrench every sum, needlessly or wickedly
laid out. ;

“ Recalling to their mind that wise and
wholesome provision of the 12th of William
3rd, chap. 2, enacting, that all resolutions taken
in the privy council shall be signed by such of
the privy council as shall advise and consent to
the same ; they would call for an immediate
renewal of that long-suspended law, and by so
doing, all destructive secret influence will be
rooted up, and the people could then, at all
times, discover who were their friends, and
who their foes. .

“The people's parliament finding, that
under various pretences grants of common
land had been obtained by sundry persons, no
ways to the benefit of the community, but
very much to the distress of the poor, the
same would be soon restored to the able,
and the robbed peasant again enabled annu-
ally to supply his distressed family with en
increased quantity of bread out of the profit
arising from the liberty regained of grazing a
cow, two or three sheep, or a brood of geese
thereon.

“ With detestation would that parliament
view any man enjoying the emoluments of six
or seven places, either needless and overpaid,
as requiring altogether but one officer, or else
their several duties neglected, and the public
thereby deprived of that service for which
they pay their money.

« anieroas other reforms would undoubt-
edly take place, even in the first session of
parliament so elected, dependent only on
their electors the people. Untorn therefore
by faction, undivided by party, uncorrupted
by ministry, and. uninfluenced but by the

gC

public ‘good, every transaction would tend to

reform, and a strict economy, its natural con-

sequence, might soon enable us to reduce our

taxes; and by the integrity of parliament, that

reduction would light upon such objects as

best might relieve the poor. This to the
. people would prove an advantageous and a
-Qovel session, and to an honest parliament
- ot a tiresome one.

“Therefore Britons, friends, and fellow
citizens, with hand and heart unite, claim
whatis your right, persevere and be free; for

_ who dare to withstand our justdemands!
—oppression already trembling at the voice
of iecividuale, will shrink away and-disappear
for ever, when the nation united shall assert
its privileges, and demand their restoration.—

thought very reasonable among the brethren,
especially when we think that publications
are covered with a sort of obscurity in its lan-
guage, as the Sheffield peuple’s Declaration,
which seemed determined to support the duke
of Richmond’s plan only; but since we find
in a printed letter received from them in a
book, that they mean to abide by some mo-
derate reform, as may hereafter be brought
forward by the Friends of the People, which
method is uncertain to us. Again we find
that the Friends of the People and the Society
for Constitutional Information do not exactly
agree. We could be glad to know the reason ;
it seems to me as though the difference was
this—the Friends of the People mean only a
partial reform; because they leave out the
words expressing the duke of Richmond’s plan
and talk only of a reform; while the Man-
chester peuple seem to intimate, by addressing
Mr. Paine, as though they were intent upon
republican principles only: now, to come
closer to the main question, it is only desired
to know whether the generality of the socie-
ties mean to rest satisfied with the duke of
Richmond’s plan only; or, whether it is their
Private design to rip up monarchy by the

shall now, sir, give you an exact account of
what plan we could wish to obtain, which I

whole body of the people, a general suffrage
of votes, and and annual parliaments. I re-

to write to them in the name of the Revolu-

__ “ Fellow Citizens ;—Yeur letter of the 11th
instant was, by the secretary, laid before the
committee of delegates of the London Cor-
responding Society.

“ Having never before heard of your society,
they wish to have some further pei ai
concerning it, as to its origin, its principles,
and the tum er of its teem: eh aac
count in your next letter will give them great
satisfaction. They do not thereughly com-
prehend how it would be possible to incorpo-
rate with our society three of your members

Norwieh, the


residing in Norwich, inasmuch as it would be
impossible to communicate to them at that
distance all our correspondence, and they
could not attend our committees, where the
business is transacted. If it is information
you want, they very readily will answer any
question you may put to them; and, to that
end, invite you to a -regular correspondence,
As to the object they have in view, they refer
you to their addresses: you will therein see
they mean to disseminate political knowled
a thereby engage the judicious part of the
nation tu demand a restoration of their rights
in annual parliaments, the members of those
arliaments owing their election to the un-
fount and even unbiassed suffrage of every
citizen in possession of his reason, and not
incapacitated by crimes. They consider the
obtaining such parliaments to be the ground
work of every necessary reform ; to this theres
fore they steadily adhere, and turn themselves
neither to the right nor to the left, to follow
any other plan whatever; the rules and order
of their society being so plain and easy, that
if they can get a majority of the nation to
act as they do, the pone reform will ef-
fect itself. They look upon the trifling differ-
ence that may have arisen between the se-
veral societies to be of very little consequence,
and think they will subside without any ways
injuring the cause. .

“ They think ita matter of small impor-
tance whatever name you choose to adopt.
They advise you to follow their plan, and di-
vide yourselves into small societies, cach of
which to choose a delegate; the delegates,
when met, to form the committee, and trans-
act the business of the society; afterwards,
let each delegate report to his division the bu-
siness so dune; let him admit fresh members,
communicate fresh intelligence, encourage
political discussion, or read to you such books
as may convey the instruction your weaker
members stand in need of ; but, above all, be
careful to preserve peace and good order
among you; let no dispute be carried to ex-
cess; leave monarchy, democracy, and even
religion, entirely aside; never dispute on
these topics, let your endeavours go to in-
crease the numbers of those who wish for a
full and equal representation of the people,
and leave to a parliament, so chosen, to form
plans for remedying the existing abuses ;
should they then not answer your expecta-
tion at the year’s end, you may choose others
in their stead. The committee offer you
every assistance in their power, but request
that your questions may relate chiefly to the
methods of obtaining a reform in parliament.
Like yourselves, they are friends to peace, not
aiaceny: and well-wishers to the rights of
man; yet not so sanguine in their expect:
tions as to imagine those rights will Te-
stored by the spontaneous consent of those
who have so long deprived mankind of them.
Understanding that ou are many societies in

oa ek recommend to you

to unite upon the plan before mentioned; the
correspondence, then carried on by one com-
mittee, will serve you all: they likewise re-
commend the appointment of one of the least
conspicuous of your members to receive such
letters as may be sent to the society, lest, if
he be well known about your town to be a
member, some interruption might take place
in the delivery. ‘

ciety, most sincerely, fellow citizens, your
fellow- labourer in the cause of freedom,

“The Committee of the Friends of the
People.

“ London, the 1st February, 1793.

“ Gentlemen ;—We are instructed by the
committee of delegates of the London Corres-
ponding Society to express the satisfaction
they experience in finding, by your answer to
our letter, that your society are willing to
communicate freely with those whose friends
they profess themselves to be: not the less
determined to obtain the desired reform, had
you refused to act in concert with us, we yet
freely acknowledge that your concurrence will
add great weight to our so just demand. Leav-
ing' the distinctions of rank, talents, and for-
tune, entirely out of the question, on a sub-
ject in which every man is equally interested,
all must be convinced, that when members of
Parliameng demand a reform, abuses certainly
exist; and that when men, distinguished for
their knowledge of the laws, join in the pur-
mal, is constitutionality is sufficiently war-
ran

“ With you we think, that ‘the common
‘ happiness of all’ is the only constitutional au-
thority laws can claim—that laws so founded
must meet the affections of the whole nation
and that those who seek the most effectual
means of obtaining such, ‘ equally promote
‘the present peace and the future prosperity of
* their country.’ -
_‘Venerating with you our excellent con-
stitution, we are firmly persuaded the resto-
ring it to its primitive purity will be found a
sufficient remedy agains every abuse we com-
plain of. Did we, however, deem less highly
of its principles, we could not be brought to
think ourselves so greatly degene as to
be unequal to the Bike| of a task which our
forefathers undertook, without fearing it would
prove beyond their strength, not to disgrace
them by supinely submitting to a total over-
throw of the glorious fabric, reared by their
yalour and cemented with their blood, from
premature apprehensions of ‘ the tempest that
* mightensue’ in a conflict of oppression against
general good—pecuniary interest, and life
Itself, are never to be brought into competi-
tion with liberty.
_ “ We thank your society for your kind ad-
vice concerning peace, order, and obedience
to the laws: we made them the foundation

of our union, as our addresses sufficiently


evince—we have never d from
obedience, and have thereby frustrated
evil designs of all those who militate against
reform.

« You acknowledge, that ‘ te wish success
* to the cause of freedom is congenial to the
‘heart of a Briton,’ instead therefore Bod ad-
mitting your argument against our havi:
published such Datiaiense by a friendly ade
dress to the National Convention of France,
that you, that all other societies, that the
whole nation did not catch the generous
flame, and follow our example—as to the
handle likely to be made of it by our corrupt
opposers (and well we have noted them), let
them use it like most of their other machina-
aa it will only accelerate that which they

read.

“ We must observe, that at a time when
the enemies of mankind are exerting every
Ee to crush the infant effort ef French hi-

'y, it became our duty, as friends to hu-
man happiness, to express the just abhorrence
we entertained of a manifesto which we con-
ceived aimed, not so much at the liberty of
France as at the liberty of the world. But
to make any particular comments upon that
manifesto is now unnecessary, as it might be
unsafe—we only wish every Briton to peruse it.

iad seepardliens of any evil intention, which
the malice of our enemies may attribute to
our conduct, we remain conscious of our rec-
titude; and that we therein acted up to the
free, open, manly, generous national charac-
ter of Britons—a character which oppression,
assisted by enervating luxury, has not yet
been able to entirely extinguish.

“© Unnoticed, however, you have tree
over our statement of_ abuses, our addresses
to the nation, our demand of protection, ad-
dressed to those whose duty it is to afford it,
and our answer to the calumnies of Mr.
Reeves’s association, we request your notice
ofthem. Pressed likewise by our numerous
country correspondents to give them au-
thentic information of what measures you
mean to pursue when you mean to be-
gin, and how far you intend carrying your
proposed reform; we beg your explicit
answer on these heads, and that you will
enable us speedily to rightly inform the coun-
try thereon—no ways doubting, but that from
your answer, we shall be enabled to assure
them that you are really what your title im-
ports, the Friends of the People, for many
thousands of whom, in the name of the Lon-
don Corresponding Society, united in one
common interest and pursuit, with man
other societies in different parts of the isl.
altogether forming no despicable number of
usotal members of society ;—we have the
honour of subscribing ourselves, your fellow.
labourers, and humble servants.”

“ Sir;—I am directed by the Society of the
Friends of the People to acknowledge the re-
ceipt of your letter, dated February 1, 17953

having pledged ourselves by our public actsand
documents, to use every effort in our power for
the purpose ofobtainingacomplete, substantial,
andi radical reform of the representation uf the
people in parliament, we never can be cos
posed to have surrendered to any other body
of men the exercise of our own discretion,
with respect both to the plan which we
deem most effectual for the purpose, and the
time which we may think most favourable
for offering it to the public; at present we
think, that to make public our views on these
subjects, would be to furnish arms to our
enemies, and to injure the cause in which we
are engaged. The period, however, is pro-
bably not very far distant when these parti-
culars will be made known to the public; it
is sufficient now to apes our confidence,

1 that moment will prove by evidence
More substantial than professions; that we
will propose no plan of reform which is short
of an effectual destruction of abuses in the
representation of the people, and that we
have honestly exerted every faculty we pos-
sess in choosing the time most favourable to
the success of our plan.

“ We have learned, with affliction and in-
dignation, the arbitrary and unconstitutional
interruption of meshing of citizens, peaceably
and lawfully assembled for the discussion and
maintenance of their rights. We have ever
viewed with utter disapprobation both of
their principles and proceedings, the associ-
ations who have been the authors or instru-
ments of this persecution. Their principles,
we think, are repugnant to the free spirit of
the English law; and their conduct, we think,
has been as injurious and oppressive, as the
principle of their institution is unconstitutional
and absurd. But deeply penetrated as we
are with these sentiments, we neither pos-
sessed power nor legal competence to inter-
pose for the protection of an individual, suf-
fering even under the most unjust prosecu-
tion, we cannot therefore feel ourselves
blameable for inaction in cases of which the
particulars were never laid before us, and in
which it might have been perhaps impossible,
rae perhaps improper, for us to have inter-
fe

“‘We do not think it necessary to make
any particular remarks on those publications
which you have put forth; we are not called
upon to pronounce any judgment on the pub-
lications of individuals or societies; and
however we may lament the grievances of
which some of your publications complain,
our efforts must necessarily be limited to the
object of our institution—the creation of an

to speak the public voice in legislation.

“€ We cannot help expressing some surprise
at the information, that societies in different

ts of the kingdom, who were solicitous
about the nature and extent of our plans of
reform, instead of expressing such solicitude to
ourselves, should have chosen the indirect
and oircuitous channel of apy other society.


Had they applied to the Friends ef the Peo-
ple directly, they would assuredly have re-
ceived every information compatible with
prudence, and with a due regard to the suc-
cess of our common cause.

“On the subject of your correspondence
with the National Convention of France, we
freely communicated to you our opinion in our
last letter; we see no reason to change the
sentiments which we then expressed on the
prudence and tendency of that measure, for
though we not only ‘ acknowledge, but avow
with pride, ‘ that to wish success to the cause
‘of freedom is congenial to the heart of a
‘ Briton ;’ yet we cannot think that men en-
gaged in so momentous a cause, as that of
parliamentary reform, are. entitled to make
public declarations, even of their most vir-
iuous sentiments, in any manner which may
injure that cause, serve the purposes, and
strengthen the pretexts of its enemies. Far
be it from us to treat with severity and rigour
even those errors and indiscretions into which
men may be betrayed by a generous zeal for
the cause of freedom, but surely it cannot be
denied, that the correspondence of societies
in this country with public bodies in France,
has furnished the most specious pretences to
interested men, for confounding a virtuous
sensibility to the interests of liberty in other
countries, with a criminal intention to intro-
duce disorder and civil commotion into our
own ; it is chiefly by the help of this pretext,
that designing men have so successfully prace
tised on the alarms of the Se and that
timid honesty has been rendered the dupe
and the instrument of corruption. But on
this subject all further remark is now become
unnecessary, as every good citizen must now
feel himself precluded from all political in-
tercourse with, France (for a period which we
earnestly pray may be very short), by a war,
the principle of which we utterly disapprove,
the inevitable evils of which we deeply de-
plore, and at the possible consequences of
which we tremble. Among the most wise
and honest friends of liberty there must arise
frequiens differences of opinion and of conduct;
and these differences, the natural effect of an
independent judgment and independent spirit,
are perfectly compatible with mutual confidence
nde g co-operation; when indecd designing per-
sons avail themselvesof such differences, tosow
distrust, and to insinuate suspicivas against the
characters and intentions of men, it is then
only that they become perniciousand injurious,
Against practices which might produce such
@ spirit of disunion and distrust, it is surely
almost unnecessary to warn the friends of
liberty, at a moment when our enemies are
so formidable and so united. They havesacri-
ficed all inferior interests and all former differ-
ences to their common interest, in perpetuat-
ing abuses and corruptions. Let it not be
said, that more generous motives have a less
powerful influence on the human mind, and
that the love of liberty is not able to produce

that union among her friends, whieh in her
enemies has arisen from the most abject and
sordid passions.

“ It seems scarce necessary to represent to
the London Corresponding Society the pe-
‘culiar necessity of circumspection and mode-
ration, at a moment when the most venial
indiscretion of the friends of reform is re-
marked with such malignant watchfulness,
and converted into an argument against the
cause of reform itself.

“ He must surely either be a secret enemy,
or an unsafe and pernicious friend of that
cause, who could prompt you to any thing
‘that could be construed into indiscretion, or
who would labour to sow distrust among the
small number of those who now appear in
behalf of freedom in England, at a period
when a persecution is carried on against the
friends of reform at home, and a war is com-
menced, which in its progress may combine
the arms of England with those of powers
engaged in a crusade against the general li-
berties of Europe.—In name and by order of
the committee, | Epwarp Jer. Currets,

« Chairman of the committee.
« No. 52, Frith-street,
February 15, 1793.

“To Mr. Thomas Hardy, secretary to the
London Corresponding Society.”

* Mr. Edward Lauzun deposed, that he found
the following paper in Mr. Hardy’s house.

« Sir ;—The committee of the London Cor-
responding Society have at present to acknow-
ledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th of
apa f
' “ With pleasure we perceive your societ
not unwillin gto keepupacorrespondence wit!
tus, yet at the same time we are sorry that
you should appear to be hurt by the plain
questions we put to you in our last; to ask of
you what measures you mean to pursue in a
matter which concerns us all, is certainly ne
ways calling upon you to surrender up to our
society, or even to the public at large, your
discretion ; nor can we conceive that a
of men having pledged themselves to the
public, can be a sufficient security to that
public to repose implicit confidence in them,
without being made further acquainted with
the nature and extent of the plan you mean
to pursue, in order that we the people may,
if we approve it, co-operate with you; the
extent of your porponedt refers we apprehend
is already determined upon, and we can dis-
cover no advantage likely to result from its
secrecy ; on the contrary, if we are to ask for
ourselves the same thing which our friends
mean to ask for us, the latter must receive
their instructions from us, or we must be di-
tected by them ; in either case there must be
no secrets ; we further conceive, that the per-
- manency of a reform must be founded on the

ee of the public, who after merely
berating om every thing proposed,


have found your plan the most useful and the

best that could possibly be laid down. The

business we are engaged in is of too impor-

tant a nature to admit of reserve or disguise ;

we will therefore, by the frankness of our be-
haviour, show ourselves worthy the friend-

ship of a society of honest men endeavouring
to serve their country, and plainly tell you

our country correspondents did not desire us

to inquire of you what you meant to do, but

fairly asked us whether we thought you ho-

nest? whether we thought you meant to
serve 2 party, or the nation? whether we
imagined you intended a partial or a complete
reform? Addressed in this manner to us, and
blunt as these questions may appear, they have
nothing in them whieh can possibly offend
you, the people having always an undoubted
right to scrutinize the character and _princi-
ples of those who call themselves their friends,
and, as such, avow an intention of bringing.
forward measures in which we are so
deeply interested. As to the furnishing our
enemies with arms by a disclosure of our in-
tention, we cannot conceive that demands,
founded on constitutional rights, can lose any
of their force by being made public. Reason
(vires acquirit eundo) to triumph requires
only to be known; and as none of the

ple’s demands are founded on fallacy, to take
the enemy by surprise weuld be unworthy of
the public champions, and moreover, per-
fectly needless when truth and reason must
unavoidably bear down aH before them with-
out the assistance of guile.

“ Under the idea that, where you say © you
© neither possessed power, nor legal compe-
“tence to interfere for the protection of an
© individual, suffering under the most unjust
£ prosecution,’ you allude to the case of our
bill sticker, we must beg to set you right, and
to inform you we never, as a society, sought
the interference of any body of men; on the
contrary, we are firmly persuaded, however
hard such cases may bear upon individuals,
they will eventually prove of service to the
public, nothing having a greater tendency
towards rousing the country from its too pre-
valent apathy, with regard to stretch of prero-
gative and abuse of power. .

“ As to our Address tothe French National
Convention, we imagine it best to say ho more
about it at present, only that if it has furnish-
ed pretexts to designing men, it has only sav~
ed them the trouble of seeking excuses else-
where: but such men, eves without our aid,
would have been at no loss ; at the same time,
we are to believe the plan for war, if con-
ceived before then, was by no means accele-
rated thereby ;—intended as_preventatives,
addresses might have been effectual, if they
had not been more generally adopted; the
only fault therein, that by a mistaken idea;
the addressers mre credit to phe pei hes a

ter a of energy t it pos-
Soseed. e@ agree wilt you, that umity of
sentiment is ne-way ingpmpatible with diver.

sity of opinion, and that the latter is natural
to m mt minds; with the same ob-
ject in view, their mode of pursuing it will
andoubtedly differ; with caution, therefore,
we will watch over those who wish to sow
athe seeds of unnecessary distrust among
us, and will at the same time take good care
that the doctrine of implicit confidence may
Dot gain ground among us; full as much as
yoursetves, we plead the necessity of union
‘among the friends of liberty, but isment
that it is prevented, or at least retarded
in many instances by the very same thing
that promotes it among the enemies of re-
form, namely, interest; with them, all their
interest is for the continuation of abuses,
‘while to some of us a reform must be attended
‘with ‘pecumiary loss, and many others would
lose their employ, their daily bread, were it
dcpown they took an active part; thus, the
same motive, assuming on one side the ap-
pearance of a virtue, gives emulation to bad
amen, and on the other, in its vilest bat most
@atural ferm, stays the pepsiess of those who,
with the best intentions, labour to save their

coentry.

“ We thank you for your kind and prudent
advice, enjoining us moderation and discretion
at this critical moment, when every impru-
dence in the advocate is liable to be rendered
prejudicial to the cause #self.”

Alexander Grant.—Examined by Mr. Garrow.

I believe you.ase by business a printer ?—
Yes, I am.

Did you at any time, and when, become a
amember of the London Corresponding Society?
—YWes ; Libelieve in the beginning of the year
4792.

To which of the divisions of the society did
‘you ‘belong ?—I think it was No. 2.

Where were the meetings of that division
theld ?—At the house of a Mr. Byde, at the
Bel in Exeter-street.

Name some of the persons who frequented
those meetings of the ‘divisions.—Vhere was
Mr. Margarot used to be one.

‘What character was Margarotin the society?
—He was conceived by me to be president of
the division.

Did he act as such ?—Yes.

Who else ?—Mr. Richter, Mr. Moore, and
several others that I do not recollect. I knew
very few of them. I think Mr. Byde, the
master of the house, was a member,

Were you applied to at any of those meet-
ings to print any papers for the divisiuns,
or for the society at large?—I was not at ‘that
time. .

When were you, if ever, applied to to print
?—I was applied to some time in the
aniddle or the latter end of the year 1792.

‘Whom was that application made to you
by ?—1 believe by Mr. Gow.

"Wes that application made by him at the


society, or at one of the division meetings ?—
I do not know positively, but 1 know I re-
fused to print something that was shown me.

I do not ask you the contents of that paper;
but did you afterwards print any thing else
for the society, which you were paid for by
any of those persons that you have named ?—
Yes: I printed a posting bill.

Upon whose application did you print that
posting bill?-Mr. Richter. I read it over
with Mr. Richter; and I agreed to print it,
and did priat it.

Do you mean the same Mr. Richter that
Lie have named as a member of the society ?
—Yes.

Did you ever see Mr. Richter at any of those
meetings of the divisions at which the prisoner
att i—Yes.

You say you undertook to print that which
Richter applied to you to print.—Yes ; five
hundred copies.

Who pein pou for them ?—Mr. Hardy, the
prisoner.

Were there any directions ig you as to
the time by which they would be required to
be printed ? was there any extraordinary expe-
dition required ?—They were ordered to be
done as fast as possible ; and I recollect when
they were done I ordered them to be sent toMr.
Hardy’s ; and I imagine my order was com-
plied with.

How soon after you had ordered them to be
sent to Mr. Hardy’s did you see Hardy?—I
dare say it wns two or three days after.

Did he pay you for those which you had
ordered to be sent?—Yes; but they were
sent back to my house. :

Did he pay before the order came for send-
ing them back to your house, or afterwards }—
No. I was paid afterwards.

And then the papers were returned to your
house?—They were returned the very same
day they were sent.

What became of them after they were sent
back to your house? did the circumstance
which you were about to state come to your -
knowledge from Hardy, or did you ever con-
verse with him upon. that subject ?—No;
never.

Do you know of your own knowledge
what became of the papers after they were
returned to your house ?—They were given by
my warehouseman to one Carter to stick up
in the streets.

Mr. Erskine.—Did you see them given ?—
No.
Mr. Garrow.—Do you know in fact that
any of those bills that you printed, and which
Hardy paid you fur, were stuck up in the
streets of this town?—No; I could not swear
that, for I did not see any to the best of my
recollection. -

Had you any conversation with Mr. Hardy
respecting those papers which Carter was
supposed to have had something to do with?
— Yes.

What passed between Mr. Hardy and you

2D

upon that subject ?—Mr.. Hardy informed me
that Carter had been taken up. '

You had given orders that these bills should
be delivered to Carter ; were they in fact deli-
vered out of your possession after they were re-
turned from Hardy’s?—They were not deli-
vered by my order to Carter.

Were they delivered out of your possession?
~—They were.

After that Hardy told you Carter had been
taken up?—Yes, for putting up those bills,
pats I told him I had been informed of be-

fore:

For putting up the bills,where ?—Up in the
streets in this town,

Did any thing more pass upon that occa-
sion ?—No.

Do you know that Carter was in fact in pri-
son for posting up those bills?—I heard it
from Mr. Hardy. I never saw him in prison.

Look at this, and tell us whether this is
one of the bills that you printed ?—Yes, I be-
lieve that is the very identical bill; I have no
doubt about it.

Had you any eonversation with Mr. Hardy
with respect to any other papers which you
had been applied to to print, and which you
had ee print—did Mr. Hardy say any
thing to you about your having declined to
print for. the society ?—He did about an addi-
tional order that I had.

The first order you complied with was for
five hundred ?—Yes. .

Who gave you the additional order ?—
There was. an order brought,I cannot tell by
whom, to me, for five hundred large bills, and
a thousand small ones.

Had you any conversation with Mr. Hardy
about that additional order?—Yes: he said
he had heard that I refused to print them.

Had you refused to print them ?—I had ac-
tually refused.

How long did you continue a member of
the society after you had refused so to print
for them?—In fact, I had not frequented the
society for some time before that: I believe
abat was in the end of November, or the be-
ginning of December.

How much was the sum lie paid you ?—
Two guineas.

You named Mr. Margarot as one ofthe per-
sons psesent at those meetings: in what
character did he act ?—He acted in the capa-
city of president of the delegates.

n what character did the prisoner, Hardy,
act?—As secretary of the division, and like-
z= as secretary of the society itself, I be-

eve.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Was there any
secretary to the division ?—I do not know ex-
pressly; for I only was twice or three times
at the farthest among the delegates.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—And it was
there that Hardy acted, was it?—He acted as
secretary to the society at large.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Where was it
that he acted?—At Mr. Byde's.


Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Do you mean
that that was a meeting of the division or of
the delegates ?—Of the division.

Mr. Garrow.—Were you ever at the Uni-
corn?—Yes; I was there once.

Try to recollect any of the members you
saw there ?—There were a great many there ;
I knew very few.

Lord Chief Justise Eyre.—Was that a divi-
sion meeting, or what?—I believe it was the
same society moved from the Bell to the Uni-
corn, the same society or the same division
that was there,

“ Address of the London Corresponding
Society to the other Societies of Great
Britain, united for the obtaining a reform
in parliament. ,

“ Friends and Fellow Countrymen;—Unless
we are greatly deceived, the time is approach-
ing when the object for which we struggle is
likely to come within our reach. That a na-
tion like Britain should be free, it is requisite
only that Britons should will it, to So.
That such should be their will, the abuses of
our original constitution, and the alarm of
our aristocratic enemies, sufficiently witness.
Confident in the purity of our motives, and in
the justice of our cause, let us meet false-
hood with proofs, and hypocrisy with plain-
ness, let us persevere in declaring our princi-
ples, and misrepresentation will meet its due
reward—contempt.

“In this view, the artifices of a late aristo-
cratic association, formed on the 20th instant,
call for a few remarks, on account ef the de-
claration they have published relative to other
clubs and societies formed in this nation. It
is true that this meeting of gentlemen (for so
they style themselves) have mentioned no
names, instanced no facts, quoted no autho-
Tities ; but they take upon themselves to as-
sert, that bodies of their countrymen have
been associated, professing opinions favourable
to the rights of man, to liberty, and equality ;
and, moreover, that those opinions are con-
veyed in the terms, no King, no Parliament.—
So much for their assertions.

“ If this be intended to include the socie-
ties to which we respectively belong, we here,
in the most solemn manner, deny thelatter part
of the charge; while, in admitting the former,
we claim the privilege and glory in the cha-
racter of Britons; whoever shall attribute te
us, who wish only the restoration of the lost
liberties of our country, the expressions of Ne
King, No Parliament, or any design of invad-
ing the property of other men, is guilty of a
e Mis an impudent, and a malicious false-

ood.

“We know, and are sensible, that the
wages of every man arc his right; that diffe-
rence of strength, of talents, and of industry,
do, and ought to afford proportional distinc-
tions of property, which when acquired and
confirmed by the laws, is sacred and inviola-

ble; we defy the most slavish and malevolent
man in the meeting of the 20th instant, to
bring the remotest proof to the contrary. If
there be no proof, we call upon them to jus-
tify an insidious calumny, which seems in-
vented only to terrify independent Britons
from reclaiming the rightful constitution of
their country. We adinit, and we declare,
that we are friends to civil liberty, and there-
fore to natural equality, both of which we
consider as the rights of mankind, Could
we believe them to be ‘in direct opposition
“ to the laws of this land,’ we should blush to
find ourselves among the number of its inha-
bitants; but we are persuaded that the abuses
of the constitution will never pass current for
its true principles; since we are told in its
first charter, that all are equal in the sight
of the law, which ¢ shall neither be sold, nor
© refused, nor delayed, to any freeman what-
“ soever ;’ should it ever happen that ‘ right
‘ and justice’ are apposed by expense, by re-
fusal, or by delay, then is this principle of
equality violated, and we are no longer free
men.

“ Such are our notions of those rights
which it is boldly maintained ‘ are inconsis-
“ tent with the well being of society.’ But
let us not suffer men who avow no principles
of liberty, whose favourite cry is inequality of
Property, to estrange others of our country-
men from aiding us in serving the community,
and from recovering to the nation that share
of its:sovereignty which has unhappily been
sacrificed to corrupt courtiers and intriguing
boroughmongers.

“ Ifour laws and constitution be just and
wise in their origin and their principle, every
deviation from them as first established, must
be injurious to the people, whose persons and
property were then secured; if at the revolu-
tion this country was adequately represented,
it is now so no longer, and therefore calls
aloud for reform.

“ If it be true that the people of Britain are
superior to other nations, is it that our taxes
are less burthensome? or that our provisions
are less expensive? is it from the various
productions of our svil that we are rich? is it
owing to the majority of our numbers that we
are strong? -Certainly not. France has the
advantage in all these respects, and, up to
this period, she has never Been our superior
in wealth, in power, in talents, or in virtues.
But let us not deceive ourselves, the diffcrence
between us and that nation was formerly,
that our monarchy was limited, while theirs
was absolute; that the number of our aristo-
cracy did not equal the thousandth part of
theirs; that we bad trial by jury, while they
had none; that our persons were protected by
the laws, while their lives were at the mercy
of every titled individual: we therefore had
that to fight for which to them wasunknown;
since we were men while they were slaves.

“¢ The scene indeed has changed; like
our brave ancestors of the last ccntury,


they have driven out the family that
would have destroyed them; they have
scattered the mercenaries who invaded their
freedom, and have ‘ broken their chains on
‘the heads of their oppressors.’ If during
this conflict with military assassins and do-
mestic traitors, cruelty and revenge have
arisen among a few inhabitants of the capital

let us lament these effects of a bloody and
tyrannous manifesto, but let us Icave to the
hypocrite pretenders to humanity, the task of
blackening the misfortune, and attributing to
: whole nation the act of an enraged popu-
ace.

“ As we have never yet been cast so low
at the foot of despotism, so it is not requisite
that we should appeal to the same awful tri-
bunal with our Petiren on the continent.
May our enmities be written in sand, but may
our rights be engraven on marble! We de
sire tu overthrow no property but what has
been raised on the rums of our liberty: we
look with reverence on the landed and com-
mercial interests of our country, but we view
with abhorrence that monopoly of burgage
tenures, unwarranted by law or reason in this
or any other nation in Europe.

“ Let us then continue with pleasure and
firmness in the path which is begun; let us
then wait and watch the ensuing sessions of
ppulanceng, from whom we have much to
nope, and little to fear. ‘The House of Com-
mons may have been thd source of our cala-
mity, it may prove that of our deliverance.
Should it not, we trust we shall not prove un-
worthy of our forefathers, whose exertions in
the cause of mankind so well deserve our imi-
tation.

“4th March, 1793.

“ Sir;—The London Corresponding Society
have at present to acknowledge your last, and
to answer more fully your preceding letter.

“ With regard to petitioning parliament, we
are unanimous in the opinion that such a pe-
tition will not produce a reform; yet, from
many considerations, we are now persuaded
that, if every society in the island will send
forward a petition, we shall ultimately gain
ground; for as much as it will force the
present members of the senate to repeatedly
discuss the subject, and their deliberations
printed in the ditterent newspapers, will most
naturally awaken the public mind towards the
object of our pursuit. The nation once in-
formed that a reform in parliament is suught
for from difierent quarters, gives rise to de-
bates in the House of Commons, and is ac-
knowledged by every rank to be wanting,
will begin to exercise their own reason on

this subject; arrived at that period, we pre-
sume our business will be nearly accomplished.

« Let us then closely follow up our Not-
tingham brethren ; let every society petition
separately; let every weck furnish a fresh pe-
tition, and afiord a fresh debate. We seek to
open the cyes of the public: petitions on our
part, and rejections on the part.of the minis-
try, will effectually do it: we therefore highly
approve of your idea, and will ourselves fol-
Tow it up, and recommend it to all the other
societies we correspond with; and, withal,
we recommend to you that no time be lost in
80 doing.

“ With you, we lament the evils of an im-
prudent and inconsiderate war—a war rather
eagerly sought for the advancement of private
ends, than carefully deprecated from conside-
rations of public good; a contest unfavourable
to this country, whether either France or des-
potism gain the upper hand. We join with
you in gratitude to those worthy members of
either House who have endeavoured to avert
this national calamity, to whom we have
likewise returned our public thanks; and we
remain, with sincerity and affection,—your

friends and fellow-labourers,

* London, May 17, 1793.

“ Sir ;—The London Corresponding Society
eagerly seizes the opportunity of Mr. Urqu-
hart returning to Edinburgh to request of
your socicty a renewal of correspondence, and
@ more intimate co-operation, in that which
both societies alike seek, viz. a reform of par-
liamentary representation, We are very sen-
sible that no society can of itself bring about
that desirable end. Let us therefore unite as
much as possible, not only with each other,
but with every socicty throughout the nation.

must now, therefore, be turned to some more

“ Edinburgh, 25th of Mey, 1793.

“ Mr. Hardy ;—Sir, Mr. Urquhart did me
the pleasure to call on Thursday afternoon,
and delivered your letter of the 17th cusremt.
I am much pleased with the contents of it,
and shall lay it before the first meeting of our
societies here, which however does not take
place till Monday seven-night. I weuld
have acknowledged the receipt of your favour
by yesterday’s post, but was too much em-

luyed in removing our household to another
lodging to attend to any thing else.

“Tf either you in England, or we in Sceot-
land should attempt separately the reform
which we, I trust, seek to obtain, we should,
by so doing, only expose ous weakness, and
manifest our ignorance of the corruption
which opposes our important und ig.
If we sought only the extirpation of one set of
interested men from the management of na-
tional affairs, that place might be given to
another set, without affecting the vitals ad-
verse to the system of reform. These might
be easily accomplished ; but to cut 2 deep
and wide rooted prejudices, to give effectual
energy to the dictates of truth, in favour of
public virtue and national prosperity, in eppe-
sition to self and all its interested habits, and
to withstand and overawe the final efforts of
the powers of darkness, is the work of the
whole, and not of a part; a work to which
mankind, till this awful period, were never
adequate, because never till now disposed to
traternize ; not merely, or only I trust, from
the sense of the common danger to which
we are exposed, but from the ennobling prim
ciple of universal benevolence.

“1 know no greater service that I can do
my conty than to promote the unien you
so wisely desire ; and I am happy to assure
you that I have hitherto discovered no senti-
ment in our association adverse to the mest
intimate and brotherly union with the asso-
ciationsin England.

“TI think the minds of all must, in the
nature of things, be now turned to more effec-
tual means of reform. Not one person was
convinced of the necessity of it by the most
convincing arguments of reason, together with
the most unequivocal expressions of universe}


desire; what then is to be hoped for from | to be apprehensive of the abilities of our own

repetition? I am only afraid that the bow in
England against reform was so contracted that
in returning, it may break. You would will-
ingly learn, you say, from us: I own that we
ought to be forward in this: we have at once,
in great wisdom, perfected our plan of organi-
zation; and, if we were in the {same inde-
pendent state of mind asthe people of England,
we would be able to take the lead. The
associations with you are no more, I fear,
(excuse my freedom) than an aristocracy for
the good of the people: they are indeed mo-
derate, firm, and virtuous ; and better cannot
be : but we are the people themselves, and we
are the first to show that the people can both
judge and resolve, if undirected by faction,
with both wisdom and moderation.

“T have not a higher wish, in the present
exertions for reform, than to see the people
universally and regularly associated, because
I am persuaded that the present disastrous
engagements will issue in ruin, and the people
then must provide for themselves; and it
would be unhappy, when we should be ready
to act with unanimity, to be occupied about
organization, without which, however, anarchy
must ensue. We will not need but to be
prepared for the event, to stand and see the
“salvation of the Lord.’ Let us therefore
take the hint given us by our opposers ; let us
begin in earnest to make up our minds re-
lative to the extent of reform which we
ought to seek; be prepared to justify it, and
to controvert objections; let us model the
whole in the Public mind; let us provide
every stake and stay of the tabernacle which
we would erect, so that when the tabernacles
of oppression in the palaces of ambition are
broken down, under the madness and folly of
their supporters, we may then, without anar-
chy and all dangerous delay, erect at once our
tabernacle of righteousness, and may the
Lord himself be in it!

* How hurtful to the feelings of a reflecting
mind to look back to the wretched state in
which the Roman monarchy, enfeebled and

ken by its own corruptions, left the nations
which it had subjected! like ‘ sheep without a
‘ shepard they soon became a prey to every
invader, because there was none to gather
and unite them: had they, foresecing the
evil, associated for mutual detence, no robber
would have been able to enslave them; the
would have given laws to all parties, as well
as to theinsclves; all separate colonies and
nations would have sought their alliance: but
mot having virtue to associate and heal the
divisions, and root out the selfish spirit, which
ambition-fostering governments procure to
their subjects, they fell under oppressors, from
under whose iron sceptre they have never yet
been able to deliver themselves.

<« We may suppuse an event which we de-
precate; nay, should we not be prepared for
every possible issue of the present unprece-
dented divisions of mankind, we have a right

managers, who are so afraid to depart from
precedent, that, like men of detail, they may
be inadequate to the task of preserving the
vessel from shipwreck, now grappling with
danger, not only great, but new and uncom-
mon. If the present ministry fail, who after
them shall be trusted? It requires little pene-
tration to see the anarchy and discord which
will follow: it will be such that nothing short
of a general union among the people them
selves will be able to heal: haste, therefore,
to associate, at least to be ready to associate.
If then, such a broken state of things should
take place, the civil broils that would necessa-
rily ensue, would soon subside before the
united irresistible voice of the whole. Do
not, I entreat you, hesitate thinking sueh a
work premature as yet: but a month, and
then it may be too late. A malignant
may be already formed, and only waiting for
the halting of the present managers ; it will
then be too late to seck to‘subject to delibera-
tion, after a party has dared the act of rebeh
lien. If you go no further than separate
meetings in different towns, we will not be
able to confide in your confraternity, because,
while in such a state, you may be but the
tools of a faction. We could have all confi-
dence, and unite with all affection in one
assembly of commissioners from all countries
of the world, if we knew they were chosen by
the unbiassed voice of the people, because
they would come up with the same disin-
terested views and desires as ourselves, havi
all agreed to a common centre of union aud
interest; but we could not confide in fellow-
citizens who kept aloof from such union, and
would not previously affiliate in one great and
indivisible family.

an address to the king—futile; a petition to

ablé; a national convention (if circumstances
admitted)—best of all. To what an alarming
crisis are we arrived !—the junto is forme

“ Fellow Citizen;—The London Corres-

pleasure, your letter of the 25th of June; but
the answer which you mention to have been
made to our three questions has not yet come
to hand. We shall be glad to be informed in
Pad next, whether it was ever putin the post-
office.

“ With regard to the questions themselves,
however individuals may have made up their
minds on them, the public seemed most to
approve the mode of petitioning parliament.
We accordingly acquiesced, and sent in a
petition signed by near 6,000 persons. With
this letter you will receive a copy of it; and
with its fate you are doubtless not unac-
quainted.

“ While we agree with you, that the people
are treated like swine, we are forced to ac-
knowledge, that some a fap from their
sloth and ignorance, scarce M deserve better
usage; however, unceasingly labouring to
meliorate their condition as well as our own,
and convinced that a thorough parliamentary
reform is the only means of effectuating it, we

firmly pursue our purpose, and in the most
conspicuous manner; under the eye of the
court, in the middle of the metropolis, and in
the very nest of place and pension hornets,
the tavern where Reeves, the tool of the
junto, holds his inquisitorial tribunal, have
ately held a general meeting of the society,
sent forth an address to the nation, and en-
tered into some spirited resolutions; a few
copies of which we desire you to accept, and
promulgate as far and as wide as you can; at
the same time rest assured, that the firmness
displayed therein is not confined to words,
but that on every occasion our society will he

preparing yourself for the event; for as it is
natural to suppose that those who now pre
on the public will not willingly yield up their
enjoyments, nor repossess us of our rights
without a struggle, which by their behaviour
in Ireland we have some reason to think
they are meditating, and perhaps may intend
to effect by means of those very foreign mer-
cenaries who are now paid by the sweat of
our brow, and whom, under some plausible

retence, it would be no difficult matter to

therein with zeal and patience, removing

Mr. Erskine.—My lord, I should wish to
put a questiou—the answer to which, indeed,
{ already foresee—whether my friends across
the table think there will be any probability
of their being able to finish their evidence
within a time that human nature is equal to
pay attention to it; because if not, to be sure
your lordships will be under the necessity of
taking some step to hear this extraordinary
cause in a manner consistently with that
justice which is due both to the Crown and
to the prisoner. I confess, that for one, I do
not feel myself atall fatigued, and am ex-
tremely ready to go on, and to remain here
any length of time which my duty to the pri-
soner can possibly require ; but if the evidence
on the part of the crowa should go on to such
an extent as that it would be impossible
either fur your lordships or the jury to give
any farther attention (and your a
and thejury are but men), then the prisoner’s
defence could not possibly be heasd; there-
fore, I should humbly suggest, if your lord-
ships find it isin your power to put this into
any traip,—I would ask my learned friends,
whether they can finish their evidence to-
night?

Mr. Bower.—It is impossible. t

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—What is your
own judgment as to the course we ought to
pursue? Mr. Attorney General, have you
nearly concluded your evidence ?

Mr. Attorney General.—Not half.

Mr. Erskine.—It is very material for us
that the jury should hear.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—As to what is
now hinted at, itis matter of very great im-
portance to the public justice of the country
In every view of it. It is undoubtedly a ge-
neral rule, that there is to be no adjournment
and no separation of the jury after the evi-
dence is entered upon, until the jury bave.
given their verdict.* That is a rule which I
shall never willingly depart from, nor ever
consent to depart from but ina case of ex-
treme necessity, and where therefore the ne-
cessity of the case will justify a deviation from
the strict rule of law.

I think the necessity does exist in every
case in which it shal! appear that the cause
wil] go into such a length that the attention
of a jury cannot be kept alive to it throughout,
without the assistance of some refreshment ;
and where, from that length, they cannot have
that assistance from the Court, which by law

. they are entitled to have; provided that ne-

cessity, therefore, is apparent in this case, I
should certainly readily incline to enter intoa
consideration of the qucstion, whether we can,
and, if we can, whether we ouglit to adjourn ;
and in what way it may be done.

I know that, in point of fact, there was anad-
journmentin onecriminal case: but that wasa

 \


misdemeanor : there was a doubt started whe-
“ther in that case, though the court adjourned,
the jury should not be kept together. I have
not been able to learn with any certainty
what the fact was; but there is one circum-
stance from whence I do conclude that, in
truth, the jury could not have been kept toge-
ther during the whole of that time, because
the adjournment thcre was over an entire
day at two different times in the course of
the hearing of that cause ; and I have no
imagination that the jury were kept together
during all that time, unless the adjournment
oeerihe day was only for a few hours; but it
is s0 long ago, that few people remember how
it was; I conceive that, under that adjourn-
ment, the jury must have becn allowed to
separate.

I am not satisfied that, in strict law, there
is a clear distinction between the case of al-
lowing a jury to separate in a misdemeanor
and ma capital case. I believe the rule of
lew is the same; and I am inclined to think
that the strict rule was, that, even ina civil
case, the jury could not separate after the
ease was once gone into. .

In the 14 Harry 7th, there was a question
debated in the Exchequer Chamber (# is in
the year book) upon the effect of the jury
having, in consequence of a violent storm to
which they were exposed, separated for a
time; they afterwards returned again, and
delivered their verdict. But the principal
doubt that arose in that case, was the cir-
cumstance of a juryman having taken some
yefreshment from the hand of a friend of one
of the parties; however, that question never
was decided; and I do not know that there is
any other case in which the question has
been much considered : therefore, if the coun-
sel for the prisoner make the application to
the court upon the ground of a necessity in-
teresting to the prisoner, andif the counsel for
the prosecution consent to that application
upon such grounds as are proper to influence
the jadgmentof the prosecutor, it seems to me

in some way or other, it would be right

that an adjournment should take place. I
showki have no difficulty with regard to the
Court; the difficulty that occurs to my mind
is with segard to the separation of the jury.
ularly, and properly, and agreeably to the
ancient course, the jury ought to be kept to-

ether.

é There are a great number of civil cases in
the old books where the jury could not agree,
or something happened in the course of the
cause that made it necessary for the Court to
be consulted before the cause could proceed.
The practice was where the jury was sent for
from the country to Westminster-hall, there
a hostel was provided for them, and they
were always sent back to their hostel: there
they were attended by an officer, and kept

mm all communication: but modern times
have totally changed the habits of business,
and there are hardly any traces of that now
left, and that sort of thing is impracticable.


I made some inquiry what might be done
(the subject, you see, was not totally out of my
thoughts) if it should so happen that the ne-
cessites of public justice should extort from
us a departure from the general rule: and the
sherills, who have been always disposed to do
what is right for them to do, and to give us all
the assistance that is possible, did promise
that they would endeavour to accommodate
the jury in this house: whether that can be
done, or whether we can depart even from
that strictness, and suffer the jury 0 go to
their own houses, upon the application of the
prisoner and the consent of the poses,
taking their word of honour that they would
have no communication with any body upon
the subject of this cause; that is a question
upon which i should much wish to hear what
my brothers have to say, after asking the

uestion again of the sheritl, what caa be
one here?

Mr. Sheriff Eamer.—My colleague and [
have made the best provision the place will
admit; we have prepared a room and beds.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre —itis a distressing
thing to put the jury into these circum
stances, which I should be sorry for, but it is
better than sitting up for three days and two
nights, which, for any thing I can see, must
be the case. I am very ready to take my
share of the fatigue, but my apprehension is,
that the cause cannot be so effectually tned
as it would be if the Court and jury had the
refreshment of food and rest.

Mr. Erskine.—It is impossible to figure to
one’s self a more delicate situation than that
which we hold who stand ascounsel for a
person who is upon trial for his life; at the
same time, my lord, I can have no difficuky
in saying that { should think the prisoner at
the bar perfectly secure in taking the solemn
word of honour of each gentleman upvun the
jury that he would not be approached (as no
gentleman upon the jury would be approach-
ed) by any man living upon the subject of the
cause: and Zam sure that, if I could not
depend upon the word of honour of each gen-
tleman of that jury, in fulfilment of that
pledge, I should address them to very litte
purpose, even upon their oath. I shall re-
commend, as to the prisoner at the bar, to
give that indulgence to the gentlemen, under
the very peculiar eircumstances of the case.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I think it is not
simply that he may give that ind I
think he must ask it as necessary to his de-
fence.

Mr. Erskine.—I certainly advise him to ask
it. Iask at upon the difference of being m
this house or going to their homes.
gentlemen seem to have paid very great at-
tention to this cause hitherto; it is my eara-
est wish they may do so throughout, to the
evidence on the part of the crowa as well as
to theevidence on the part of the defendant ;
andI am willing that they shall be as free as
air, with the single restriction, that they will


ot suffer themselves to be approached in the
way of influence ; and the gentlemen will not
thinkit much that that should be required,con-
sidering the very peculiar nature of this case.

Lord Chief Baron Macdonald.—The reason
why the jury should never separate was, that
‘they should not give in their verdict under
any improper impression : but if that should
superinduce an atter impossibility that justice
could be done either by the jury or the bench;
pay, by the witnesses pessibly, whose recol-
lection, if they sit up for many hours, must be
extremely imperfect: and ifthe gentlemen at
the bar cannot do justice to their clients on
either side,—if that is the case, and justice
cannot be done, you must look to the prisoner,
his case requires equal regard. The prosecu-
tor’s evidence had the opportunity of being
heard when the jury were fresh; now, if they
are incapacitated to attend to his case in the
way that his case requires, justice will not be
done to him. :

If we are under the absolute necessity of
departing in some degree from the strict rule,
I dank we'should depart as little as possible ;
and, therefore, I confess the only hesitation in
my mind is between the jury's being accommo-
dated here and their going home to their own
houses: I have a great deal of difficulty, I
own, about that.

Mr. Erskine.—I wish to be understood that
it was a matter of great indifference to me, and
it only arose from a desire I had in my mind
that the jury should not be deprived of going
home to their own families for want of a con-
sent from me, and I am persuaded I hazard
nothing by that consent.

Mr. Garrow.—We have the same anxious
desire, provided it can be done consistently
with the rules of law, that the jury may be
accommodated.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—If the jury live
at a great distance, they might rather choose
to sleep here. e

One of the Jury.—I live at Marybone, and
am rather an invalid, but I would rather go

ome.

[Several of the jury said they wished to go

home.

Mr. Baron Hotham.—Mr. Erskine stated
himself to be in a very delicate situation,
which he certainly is ; and it is impossible for
him not to see that the Court also are ina
very delicate situation; because, as to our-
selves, if the adjournment is to take place,
every body knows that there is no reason why
we should be kept in this house ; we may go
to our respective homes; at the same tine,
there never has Leen an instance of a jury se-
parating, and going away in the manner that
is now etapa. Tcontess I think that there
may be very serious consequences from it,
As to the necessity, I think nobody can re-
sist it; itis evident that the trial must go to
such a length, that it cannot be proceeded
upon safely without some sort of an adjourn-
ment of that kind: but I do foresee very



serious difficulties hereafter, as well as pet-
haps in this very case, in gentlemen going
home, and separating themselves. It is a
very delicate and unpleasant situation to be
pblized to say to gentlemen that they must
be kept here all night; but really, if I am
forced to speak, I think that they ought not
to separate.

Mr. Justice Buller.—Here is an alderman
who remembers the trial of Bet Canning ;*
he informs me that, to his knowledge, the
jury went home during that trial.

Mr. Alderman Newman.—I remember it
perfectly well; I spent the evening with one
of the jury.

Lord Chief Justice Fyre—Do you think
you are able to go on all nizht? if you do go
on all night we shall make but a certain pro-

ess, and I am afraid we shall be in no con

ition to pursue our business to-morrow.

Mr. Justice Bu/ler.—I understand the she-
tiffs have beds prepared here for all_ the jury.

Mr. Sheriff Eamer.—There are beds and
Mattrasses prepared.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—The rule of law
is clear beyond all doubt; at the same time,
the necessity of public justice arises distinctl.
and visibly, and is felt by all mankind: i
my apprehension, that will justify a departure
from the strict rule, but it will only justify
that departure as far as the necessity goes,
and there the difficulty is: but, to be sure, if
the jury can be accommodated, and can have
that refreshment which is necessary to go on,
without separating, then the necessity {have
been speaking of does not carry them through
the whole case of being allowed to separate.
As there is nu doubt in any body’s mind
about it, we must‘desire the sheritls to give
the jury all the accommodation they can fur-
nish them with, and we must desire of them to
submit to a difficulty which I am very sorry
is imposed upon them, but which I do not see
any means of avoiding. Bailiffs must be
sworn to attend the jury. The counsel for
the prisoner will observe, that the recorg
mutt be made up as of the first day of the
trial.

Mr. Erskine.—Be it so, in the most em
phatical way, for the purposes of Jaw and jus-
tice.

[Four bailiffs were sworn to attend the jury.}

Mr. Erskine.—My lord, all this immense
body of papers has been seized, and been @
long time in the hands of the officers of the
crown—We applied to see them, but were re-
fused—we applied to the privy council, and
were refused—we were referred to your lord-
ship, because they knew your lordship could
not grant such arequest—we are therefore here
with all these papers tumbled upon our heads,
without the least opportunity of examining
them, and yet from this mass of papers, whic!

aE

the attorney-general took nine hours to read,
the act of compassing the king's death is to
be collected. From a view of the whole, I
trust your lordships will be disposed to in-
~ dulge me—indeed I shall expect, in justice to
the prisoner, that I may have an opportunity,
betore I address the jury upon this mass of
evidence, to know what is in it, because your
lordships must very well know that, though
taking all the pains I can to look at it as itisread,
yet itis quite impossible for the human mind
to take it in, or form any idea of it, without an
hour- or two at least (for I_ should not require
more) to take it into consideration. When I
look across the table, and see I am address-
ing myself te hon. gentlemen of the profes-
sion, who know the situation I am in, I can-
mot doubt their consent—and the reason I
mention it now is, that there may not be any
inconvenience to your lordship in praying this
upon the sudden.

I declare, upon my honour, as far as relates
#o myself and my friend who is assignod as
counsel for the prisoner, we have no design
whatever to trespass upon the time and pati-
ence of the Court, and your lordships have
seen to-day how little of your time we have
consumed—we have ne desire upon earth, I
appeal to God in it, but to do our best, to do

justice to the person your lordship has assign- |,

ed us counsel for.
. Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—We. shall cer-
tainly be disposed to give the counsel for the
prisoner all reasonable opportunity to make
the best defence the nature of the case is ca-
pable of. I observe the greater number of
papers that have been read, and the most im-
portant as yet, are papers that are printed,
and before us, therefore, there can be no dif-
ficulty as to them, for I have no doubt that
the printed papers have been very well
considered—To-morrow we shall see what
the papers will be; if there are any which
appear to us, or shall appear to you, to be pa-
pers that require a careful casting your eye
over before you prepare for your defence,
I shall certainly propose to the Sour that you
su have a reasonable opportunity for so
loing.

Mr. Erskine—Those that are printed are

thrown together, your lordship must observe,
in a strange way.
* Lord Chief Baron Macdonald.—With re-
si to the complaint of the privy council,
there is no instance, I believe, of their ever
suffering such a communication,

Mr. Erskine—I am not complaining of
the privy council-—we were referred by the
privy council to the crown, and by the crown
to your lordship.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I do not think it
possible for the Court to have interfered upon
any ground. It is one thing to permit the priso-
ner to see the evidence that is to be made use
of against him, and it is another thing, if it
should so happen, that in the seizing of his
papers, there arg papers not fit to be made use


of against him, but that are necessary for his
defence, that such papers should have been
seen; in that case, I apprehend that upon
an application to the privy council or the se-
cretary of state, that they would do what pub-
lic justice requires—order access to such pas
pers. The papers which are to be produced

y the prosecutor, a prisoner never has by law,
nor ought to have an opportunity of examine
ing till they are produced in evidence. Pa»
pers that are not necessary for the prosecution,

ut necessary for his defence, come under a
very different predicament, and I think the
rule held upon them would be very different,

Mr, Law.~The papers in the case of Mr,
Sayre * had been seized, and the chief justice
said, give notice of the papers you. want,. and
move for them.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—If you asked to
look at those papers which were intended to
be produced against you, I do not think that
was right.

Mr. Gibbs.—We asked to look at that book,
that we might see what papers were neces-
sary for our defence.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---¥ believe we had
better not discuss the thing now.

London, the 5th Octr. 1793.

“ Dear Sir ;--With pleasure I peruse your
favour of the 2d inst. but as yet have seen
nor heard nothing of the two copies of Mr.
Muir’s trial, which you mention as being sent
to the society and myself; be kind enough,
notwithstanding, to return that gentleman
thanks for his polite attention, and assure
him, that we view him in the light of a mar-
tyr to freedom as well as Mr. Palmer, and
that our warmest hopes are, that the op-

pressors of mankind will either be ashamed
or afraid of carrying their revengeful malice
into execution. .
“The general convention which you men-
tion, appears to Mr. Margarot (to whom alone
I have communicated your letter) and myself,
to be a very excellent measure; and as such,

lection. ;

I could wish Sieg witKout delay to communi-
cate it officially to our society, without any
“ways mentioning that you had written to me
privately. If, in your official letter, you should
Tequire of us to send a deputation to that
meeting, I have no doubt ‘but our society
‘would with pleasure accept the invitation ;
and I am persuaded it would do much good.
Our freedom, as you justly observe, depends
entirely upon ourselves, and upon our avail-
ing ourselves of this opportunity, which, once
Jost, may not besoon recovered. Iam glad to
discover by your testimony, that 1 was not
mistaken in the high opinion I always had of
lord Daer’s patriotism; a title may be a bar
to disinterested patriotism, but it seems,
he has evinced it not to be an insuperable one.

“You are right; it is true, that we have
had another general meeting, at which a
hastily composed, and suddenly ‘produced
address to the king was read, applauded, and
agreed to be presented, but on a cool revisal,
the said address being found ‘to be more ill-
natured than spirited, more dangerous in its
language than advantageous in its object,
besides being too long, the committee, with
the approbation of the society, have adopted
another, much safer, more apposite, and relat-
ing solely to the war—inclosed you have a
copy of it. But you was misinformed, when
‘you was told we passed any resolution at that
meeting, for we only came to one, and that
tather of a private nature, namely, that the
conduct of sir James Saunderson in prevent-
ing the meeting of the London Corresponding
Society at the Globe tavern, Fleet-street, was
vf such a nature as to place him below eur
censure.—Dear sir, please to write to the so-
ciety as soon as possible, officially. Iam, most
sincerely,—your fellow labourer, and well:
wisher, Tnomas Harpy.

“‘P.S. Mr. Margarot desires to be remem-
dered to you in the most affectionate.manner.
Do not in future, on the addressof your letters
to me, mention any thing of the London Cor-
responding Society, for it was a thousand to
one that I received that letter by post.

& Mr. Wm. Skirving, Head of the

Horse Wynde, Edinburgh.”

Mr. Thomas Maclean.—I found this letter
at Mr. Adams’s.

Mr. Wood to Alerander Grant.—Look at
the indorsement on this letter. Do you be-
lieve that to-be the prisoner’s hand-writing ?
—The indorsement is—“ To be returned to
the committee on Thursday next.”—I believe
thatis Mr. Hardy’s hand-writing.

‘ “ Edinburgh, Oct. 5th, 1793.

“ Brother Hardy;—The letter and this
paper will explain themselves. I was at a
meeting on the day this mentions, and the
determination of the association are universal
suffrages and annual parliaments, and it was
tbe unanimous desire and wish of that meet-


ing, that two persons, if possible, should be
sent from our society in England, as delegates,
to meet our dear northern frends in the ensu-
ing convention. I must earnestly desire the
said wish of our friends here may be complied
with, as it will add to the dignity of our asso-
ciation in particular, and to the convention in
general, and will further the common cause
much, ina way the Judgment of our associa-
tion must hit upon, without any explanation
of mine. If any person could be elected of
sound principles, a clear understanding
speaker, with a long head and a good warm
heart in ‘the cause of freedom, having it in
view, and not his own aggrandizement, such
a delegate would be of great service. If sucky
a one is chosen, he must be here by the
twenty-ninth day of this month, as the con-
vention meets on that day; and if my poor
feeble efforts will be of any service to the con-
vention as the other delegate, the London
Corresponding Society may command me for
the support of their interests as far as lam
capable; but those of you who know me,
know I am no speaker, much less an orator,
but this I will say, my heart lies in the right
pare and hates and abhors all despots, ©
lease to communicate this to our friends,
and let me know the society’s determination,
if they will honour me with their confidence.
I am often with our friend Muir; he bears his
confinement with a fortitude of soul, inspired
with the genius of liberty; he is well. I
have much ¢o say, but I must leave off. This
letter will be delivered by my servant, which
must have a speedy answer, because of. the
approaching meeting here. Every thing. of
moment I will communicate to you from
time to time; and wishing destruction to all
human butchers, and success to all friends of
liberty, I remain, brother Hardy, yours to
command, A. CaLenpeR.”

Mr. Gibbs —You found this yourself, I sup-
pose.—I did not.

Then you should not have answered in that
manner.—Lhe question was put in such a
way that I thought I was bound to give a
direct answer, I will explain the circum-
stance. On the ath of December, the pro-
ceedings of the convention had attracted the
notice of those in Edinburgh who had the
charge of the police—

Mr. Gibbs—We do not want all this; we

only want to know whether you saw this
found, or saw it in his possession ?—I did not
see it.
. Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—What do you
know about the paper?—A warrant was
issued at my instance ; the papers found in his
possession were put into two bags and sealed
up; the bags were brought sealed from
Skirving’s lodgings to the office where he was
examined.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Where were
you at that time ?—I was present in the office
when he was examined.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre-—Then the first
time you saw any thing of this paper was
when it was produced at the office by a person
we brought it in a sealed bag: is it so?—

es.

Mr. Wood.—And opened in the presence of

Skirving ?—Yes.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—He has proved,
that upon a warrant having issued to appre-
hend Skirving, there was a sealed bag brought
to the office ; Skirving was present, and that
sealed bag was opened, and the letter was
produced.

Ut is,

Do you know any of the other signatures?

“ London, Nov. 8, 1793.
. “ Fellow Citizens;—I duly received your
favour of the 4th instant, and laid it before
the committee of delegates last night, who
were anxiously waiting for intelligence from |
Edinburgh, and were well satisfied with the
agreeable account of the great number and
zeal of the friends of freedom in Scotland.
That part of your letter which mentions your
visiting different towns in Scotland, for the
purpose of promoting the cause, they were
leased with the idea, but they thought that
it could not be put in practice on account of
the necessary supplies, which come in but
very sluwly. It is to be mentioned in the
different divisions. We have elected J. Bax-
ter (by ballot) as chairman of the committee
for the remainder of the quarter. We have
also appointed a committee of constitution,
Separate from the committee of delegates;
one member is chosen from each division, to
meet on this night for the first time, and to be
totally unconnected with the committee of
delegates. We still increase in number, and
the address to the king to put an end to the
war is ordered to be advertised to receive
signatures in the Courier, Chronicle, Ayres’s
Sunday Gazette; afterwards by hand-bills,
&c. We have opened a correspondence with
@ new society at Bristol. I have to inform
you of the wish of the society that you would
favour them with the number of delegates in
the convention, and the number from England
also, and how the civil and military power
relishes your meeting; and that you would
send al a report from the convention as
might appear in the newspapers in London.
Send me an Edinburgh Gazetteer when there
is any thing in it of importance. I would
have sent you a Courier, but they informed
me that they sent several to the coffee- houses
and taverns in Edinburgh; for that reason,
I thought it unnecessary. I hope to have more
time to write to you more fully next time.
As, sir Joseph Murray says, the post is just
going off, no more at present from

“ Mr. Margarot and Mr. Gerrald, delegates
from London ,

* London, Nov. 15, 1793.
“ Fellow Citizens ;—I received your official
Jetters of the 7th and 12th, and Maurice
Margarot’s private letter of the 11th, all in


due course. At the committee’ of delegates
last night, after hearing the report of the
different delegates — the rapid influx of
New members — there was several places
mentioned in different situations in town,
both in public and private houses, for new
divisions of the London Corresponding So-
ciety to meet at —— some have already taken
place, others will next week.—Afterwards,
the correspondence was taken into conside-
ration, Your official letter was read, and
much approved of, and copies of jt taken for
the use of the different divisions. It seems
to be the gencral wish of the differ-
ent divisions of the society for you to conti-
nue as long as you can be of real use to the
cause ; but it wholly depends upon the thing
necessary, money. We have hit upon an exe
pedient, which we mean to put in practice in
two or three days, that promises fair to bring
in a considerable revenue. I shall inform
you of it in my next. Those whom you gave
directions to call upon has fallen far short of
that liberality which youexpected. Thecom-
mittee last night gave me orders to transmit
to you twelve guineas; I enclose you a draft
on sir William Forbes, and Co. for that sum.
Next week I hope to be able tosend you more.
There was another report of Mr. Frost being’
to be pilloried on last Tuesday and Wednes-
day; but it happened that, on Wednesday,
a Charles Leslie stood in the pillory at Char-
ing-cross for a crime shocking to mention,
Mr. Frost is not very well at present. The
Constitutional Society have adjourned for a
month from last Tuesday. The reason why
Mr. Yorke did not go from that society was,
that he wrote a letter to them, informin
them that he would not go unless they “old
pay him the whole of the money down. I
have only given you a summary account of
our proceedings; but you know how I am
situated both in the day and in the evenings,
that I cannot command a quarter of an hour
to myself; therefore I hope you will excuse
me for being so laconic. I have made the
situation of Mr. Muir as public as I could;
it throws a damp upon the spirits of every
friend to humanity who hears of his cruel
treatment. I remain your fellow-labourer in
the good cause.

citizen Gerrald to favour him with a letter.

“ P. 8. Friend Margarot, I have not yet
been able to do your business, which you left
for me to execute before you left London. I
have not been able to see that gentleman
which you mentioned in your last, nor do I
expect that I will these three weeks.”

“ Fellow-Citizens ;—I duly received your

Jetters of the 12th and 28th instant, which I
laid before the committee last night. After
reading and deliberating upon them maturely,
they resolved that you should continue at
your post till you hear from me officially after
the next meeting of the general committee of
delegates; by that time we may form some
idea what success we are likely to meet
with from the advertisement and circular
letter. We entertained high hopes of be-
Sng liberally assisted by the friends of free-
dom. A circular letter was ordered to be
drawn up, to be sent to the different societies
in England with whom we correspond, in-
‘viting them to send delegates to the conven-
tion in Scotland, to promote a reform in par-
diament. A standing committee of five is
appointed to answer the correspondence dur-
ing your mission inScotland. Your objection
’ to forming a new constitution in your absence
‘was not by them reckoned valid: it is very
possible that it will not be accepted before
your return; for it will be maturcly investi-
gated by all the divisions of the society before
at is fully agreed to: besides, it cannot affect
you in your present mission, for you well
now that we are not very fond of ex post

“ Citizens ;—I_ am desired by the general
commitee to make you acquainted with their
determination relative to your stay in Scot-
Jand, which is, that you are both toremain at
your post until the convention adjourns for
the present season: then both to return to
England with all possible expedition.

“ The 122. 12s, Od. which I transmitted on
the 22nd instant by the order of the commit-

ways doubt not you would have acknowledged
the receipt ; and not having received any fet-
ters since the date of the 20th instant, are
also concerned for fear they should have been
intercepted. We are highly pleased with
the proposed union with our northern bre-
thren, and beg you will use every exertion in
your power to establish that desirable union
wpon a firm and permanent basis. it gives
us great pleasure and encouragement to hear
that the spirit of liberty is so flourishing in
the north, and are happy to inform you that
the same noble spirit is making a rapid: pro-

ess in the south. We are sorry to hear of

{It was read.] -

“ Edinburgh, Tuesday, Dec. 2, 1793.

“ Citizen Hardy ;—We received last night
a letter signed by you, but written by another
Person, acquainting us with the determination
of the committee, ‘ that at the adjournment
¢ of the convention, we should return imme-
‘diately toLondon.’ This determination we
will undoubtedly conform unto, unless it be
(as we hope ad trust it will) contradicted in
your next ; for, if the committee abides by it,
we who, by being on the spot and thoroughly
ac alm with the state of the country, cam
judge with certainty thereon—do assure you
that our immediate return to London will be
attended with very bad consequences; for at
present all the country societies look up to
us to come among them, to enliven, to en-
courage them, to convince them by our pre-
sence that we exist, that we have been sent
from England for the purposes of union and
reform, and that the time is near at hand
when such reform must take place. Nothing,
dear friends, must force us from Scotland at
pees but the absolute impossibility of

earing the expenses attending our mission,
and those expenses may be somewhat les-
sened by recalling one of us and leayimg the
other; our Norwich friends may likewise
bear a part of them; so that, unless the funds
of the socicty are very low indeed, no excuse
for recall can be valid, unless founded on fear,
and that we must remind you, is our concern
and not yours. While, therefore, the idea of
uniting our society with the whole kingdom
of Scotland affords you a pleasing prospect,
let us do every thing in our power to cement
that union; and this can only be done by a
longer residence in the country, and by visit-
ing the several societies which have sent de-
legates to Edinburgh, and would think
themselves ill-used if we did not take theit
town in our way. Consider of it then, we
beseech you, and let us have your answer
immediately. ..

“ The convention proceed with great spirit;
we sit daily: and last week we came toa
resolution, which we fancy will give pleasure
to every fricnd to reform: as the minutes are
to be printed, we will, at present, only give
you the heads of it, viz. aan

* That should any attempt be made by gu-
vernment for the suspension of the Habeas
Corpus bil, the introduction of a convention
bill, or the landing of foreign troops in Great
Britain or Ireland, the delegates are inme-
diately to assemble in convention at a certain
place, the appointment of which is left with
@ secret committee. That, when seven de-
legates shall be thus assembled, they shall
declare themselves permanent; and, when
their number amounts to twenty-one, they
shall proceed to business: thus you see we
are providing against what may happen.

“ Citizen Gerrald’s health ts so far reco-
vered as to not prevent him from fully at-
tending his duty. We cannot say as much of
citizen Sinclair,* from the Society for Consti-
tutional Information; he has been confined
to his bed ever since Saturday by a violent
fever and sore throat: he is, however, some-
what better this morning. He is a valuable

oung man; and should he die, his loss would
ts severely felt; not indeed by his consti-
tuents, who have basely abandoned him, but
by all the friends of freedom. He is a mem-
ber of our society, and we recommend him to
your notice.

“ You will before this have received our
est, of the 26th November, acknowledging
the receipt of your letter of the 23rd, together
with a remittance of 12/. 12s. Od. Our time
is so constantly employed that we find it ab-
solutely impossible as yet to write to you
more than once a week, and even that on no
fixed day; eighteen hours out of the four-and-
twenty are devoted to public business, and
you may rest assured they are not mis-
spent. We are happy to hear that you go on
as well in the south as we do in the north.
Letters convey but very imperfectly, and
with no great degree of safety, what we
might wish to inform each other of. You
have done us a material injury by neglecting
to send us a parcel of our publications, and a
number of copies of the Juryman’s Rights ;
pray do not delay them any longer, and
among them some of the letters to Dundas.
We sent you an Edinburgh Gazetteer last
week: we will send you another to-morrow;

in the convention.—We remain, most sin-
cerely, your fellow-labourers in the cause of

Addressed—“ Mr. Thomas Hardy.”

To Mr. William Scott.—Were these papers
found in the same manner as the other pa-
pers ?—~They were.

Mr. Bower.—These are the proceedings of
the convention.

Mr. Erskine.—I confess I am not veryanxi-
ous to shut out any evidence. I very probably
eee See et ae



do not understand it; but I do not see how
it bears upon the case. As the case stands
at present, the evidence is this. This society
was formed, the object of its formation has
been read in evidence, subject to such con-
struction as the gentlemen of the jury upon
their oaths shall be disposed to put upon
it, in connexion with all the rest of the evi-
dence. They appoint two delegates to attend
this Edinburgh Convention, and your lordships
will have the goodness also to recollect, that
the holding of that convention is not an act
which is charged at all upon this record ; but
the conspiracy, as it is called, was to assem-.
ble another convention at a very distant pe-
riod after this first convention bad been ds
persed.

We had it in evidence recently, we have
all heard within these five minutes that those
two gentlemen who were appointed as dele-
gates to represent the Corresponding Society,
of which the gentleman at the bar was se-
cretary, had instructions given them, which
instructions directed these delegates to pur-
sue closcly those rulcs and institutions of the
society which have been read in evidence.
Therefore, my lord, if they have—I do not
know that they have, nor do I care whether
they have or no—if it should turn out in the
proceedings that are now proposed to be read,
that this convention at Edinburgh did, in the
moments of heat and irritation, which I take
for granted always must belong to persons
in the situation in which they were placed—
if they had written, or said, or done any
ba nay, I will go farther, if Mr. Marga-
rot has done any ing, or said any thing,
not within the scope of the instructions given
to him, which instructions have been read in
evidence, and which instructions refer also to
the institution of the society, which has been
also read in evidence, I-humbly contend that
cannot affect the prisoner in any way: and,

ive me leave for a moment to call this to
the serious consideration of the Court. .

The defendant is charged with no act of
the Edinburgh Convention ; no, he is charged
with that of which if I could believe him one
moment in my mind to be guilty, although I
must stand here to do my duty towards him,
yet I should do it in another fashion than I
mean to perform it—he is charged with com-.
passing and imagining the death of our sove-
reign lord the king, whose life is dear, my
lord, toall the kingdom ; in order to prove that
he had from the beginning that wicked inten-
tion, for that wicked intention is the founda-
tion of the whole procecding, and no act can
be given in evidence before your lordships,
nor will I sit here silent to hear any act given
in evidence that does not go to show the pri-
soner at the bar had that wicked compassing.
Ladmit that, if they can show that any in-
structions were given to these two men, which
instructions carry upon the face of them (and
whether thev carry it upon the face of them
or no is subject to the consideration that they

are to receive from the jury) evidence of that
wicked intention, or that that intention: can
be proved by any thing that is like inference
or construction (for this is not an extension
of the statute at all) this is matter of evi-
dence.

My friend Mr. Gibbs and myself have sat
silent; your lurdships, I am sure, must agree
that we have given no sort of trouble to the
Court, nor do I mean in the progress of the
cause to give trouble to the Court; when,
therefore, they read any thing that comes
from Mr. Hardy, or any thing that does not
come from him, though he is the mere in-
strument, as the secretary of a body of men,
yetif he mixes in it, we have never objected to
itas evidence ; but when they propose to read, I

do not know what it is—probably I am wast--

ing my own breath and your lordship’s time
in opposing that which will be of no conse-
quence, pethaps, when it comes to be read ;
but when I stand here defending this man,
who holds his life under the law, and I am
not defending his life only, but my uwn life,
and the life of every man in the country, I
must take care that the rules of evidence are
observed—I wish to know the nature and the

ality of the paper. If it be something Mr.

ardy is cognizant of, if they can show that
the proceedings of the convention were known
to and approved of by Mr. Hardy, my objec-
tion falls to the ground, and I have nothing
to say about them.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I take it for
granted they mean to do that, because,
otherwise, the proceedings of the convention
at Edinburgh can be nothing in this cause.

Mr. Bower.—There are subsequent appro-
bations of them without end; we shall read
evidence enough of that by and by.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—There is enough,
in my opinion, to let in the evidence; the
application of it is quite another censidera-
tion: this is the act of a body, to which this
prisoner sent persons to act in his name; he
may afterwards to be sure object that they
exceeded their commission, and therefore
they are personally responsible; but I think
that will be observation upon the evidence, it
is no objection to the evidence.

Mr. Erskine.—I am perfectly satisfied ; I
only wanted to know what we were about.

Mr. Solicitor General.— Mr. Skirving must
be considered as agent to the society, and it
is extremely important, as it seems to me——

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—It is agreed to
be read, subject to the observations that may
arise upon it. ;
[The Minutes of the convention at Edinburgh

already printed at full length in the trial

“ Edinburgh, Dec. 8, 1793.

“ Fellow Citizens ;—We desire that a copy
of the inclosed papers be kept by the society,
and that another copy of them be delive
without delay to citizen Martin, in order that
he may proceed thereupon immediately.

“ You willalready have had confused ac-
counts of what has taken place here for the
last four days, but on T uieslay next the Edin-
burgh Gazetteer shall (if despotism permit}
give you a complete detail of every thing; the
society will thereby be able to discover, that
our arrival in Scotland has been productive of
great advantage to the cause, and at the same
time has given great alarm to our enemies.
We are very much surprised at the remiss-
ness of the society, while we are exposing
our life and liberty, while we are devoting
our time and our exertions to their service,
while we are incurring numberless_ expenses,
and affronting dangers which would stagger
the most hardy of them; while we are doin:
all this, we are moreover obliged to remind
them of it, and that supplies are now become
more necessary than ever. Surely the pecu-
niary exertions of any individual in the soci-
ety can never be compared to our endeavours;
honoured with their confidence, we find our-
selves happy in being placed in the front of
the battle ; but let them remember that our
sacrificing ourselves will be of little use, un-
less they afford us a proper support, and that
most immediately. Not daring any longer
to trust to the post, we send you all these
papers in a parcel ; you will be so guod as to
make us acquainted with their safe arrival.
Gerrald wishes to get to London as soon as
possible: he will communicate that which
cannot be so fully expressed by letter; you
may consider this as a private letter, but you
may read such parts of it, as you think pro-
per, to any member of the society, especially
where it may be productive of good. You
will see by the inclosed papers, that power
has proceeded in a most arbitrary manner;
almost all the prominent characters in the



convention have been, or are to be appre-
hended and examined. Lord Daer will, we
believe, meet with no greater favour than
ourselves ; we understand that there is a war-
rant out against him. As an account of what
has happened to us would exceed the bounds
of a letter, we will only just give you a sketch
of it, by way of journal, referring you as we
said before, to next Tuesday’s Gazetteer.

s Thursday morning at seven o'clock, a
sheriff's officer, followed by five other men,
entered our bed-room, informed us he had a
warrant (which, however, he refused to show)
for apprehending us, and scizing our papers.
We remained confined all day; at night we
were examined and admitted to bail, each in
the sum of two thousand merks.

“ Friday morning, at nine o'clock, we were
sent for again without a warrant, for the pur- |
pose of being present at the opening of al
small trunk, containing our popes ; but M.
ML protesting against the i legality of the
whole of the proceedings, and refusing to give
up the key, the sheriff substitute and the pro-
curator fiscal dared to proceed no farther in
the business.

“ Saturday morning, at nine o’clock, two
messengers came again into our room with
Gerrald; they left a summons to appear at
‘ten o’clock with M. M.; they left nothing
but a request to accompany Gerrald to the
office, yet when arrived there, he found that
@ warrant was issued against him, for the
purpose of detaining him a prisoner. While
the box was opened, and the papers examined,
M. M. still persisting in his refusal, the ke
was forced from him, the trunk was opened,
the papers examined, and rae restored; the
other part was kept, and a declaration drawn
up which he was required to sign, but refused,

otesting against the whole of the business.

errald, however, signed what was drawn up
in his name, and we were once more libe-
rated ; and since then, now already twenty-
four hours, no further persecution bas been
commenced against us; but while we, as_in-
dividuals, were thus harassed, (Thursday)
the whole of the convention were equally ill
used; many of them were taken into custody,
and when the remainder met as usual, the
provost, attended by his myrmidons, went,
and after pulling Matthew Campbell Browne,
of Sheffield, out of the chair, ordered the con-
vention to disperse, and informed them that
he would allow no such meetings in future.
(Friday) the next day, the convention having
agreed to meet at another place, out of the
jurisdiction of the provost; we not
tear long assembled before the sheriff, with
his myrmidons, appeared among us, and com- |
manded us to depart; after having asked!
. whether that meeting was the British Con- |
vention, and being answered in the affirma-
tive, he next i oes who was president,
upon which M. M. having openly asked, and |
obtained leave of the convention, placed him- ;
self in the chair; informed the sheriff that he |



M. M. was then president of the British Con”
vention, and that he would not break up the
meeting unless unconstitutionally forced there-
unto by the sheriff's pulling him out of the
chair; which the latter (after some little
hesitation) having complied with, the ex-pre-
sident (Gerrald) was also put into the chair,
which he would not leave but by being pulled
out ; adjourned the convention to the place
where it was to become permanent in ils sit-
ting, and having called upon his colleague
Gerrald, for to close the meeting with prayer,
the company departed peaceably, but not
without various reflections on the pro-
ceedings, and those reflections not confined
merely to the members of the convention, but
coming also from the crowd without doors,
and even from the attending constables. The
next day a [esaresion was issued by the
pores forbidding all assembling within the
imits of his jurisdiction. We know not what
will happen, but we venture to predict that
all this persecution will increase rather than
diminish the ardour of the people for reform.
The country societies hearing of this, are
hourly pouring in fresh delegates. Want of
paper forbids my writing any more.—Adieu,
yours, M. M.”
“ Edinburgh, December 19, 1793.

“ Fellow Citizens ;—It is impossible for us
to find time to write you as we ought; every
instant we are injgrrupted, or rather the house
is not free from visitors from early hour until
twelve at night, and we have besides sucha
variety of business upon our hands that we
can scarcely make any progress. However,
as Sinclair, the delegate of the Society for
Constitutional Information, will arrive in
town as soon as this letter, he will be able to
give you an accurate verbal detail of all the
infamous proceedings which have taken place
here—of the progress of reform, and of the
plans for future operations. My colleague
Gerrald also proposes to leave this place the
latter end of this, or the beginning of next
week. He will explain himself to you. Pray
send him money for his journey, &c. He is
now gone to Perth on very urgent business.
Excuse me from entering into any detail at

resent. We have to acknowledge your two
jast letters; they came safe, but slow, being
delivered only five days after their date,
where the delay originated we cannot tell—
your first gave us a draft for twelve guineas ;
and your second enclosed a ten pound note,
both very acceptable ; but we are sorry toadd,
that they do not clear our expenses. Expenses
which are no ways owing to extravagancy but
to absolute necessity, and are extremely pro-
fitable to the cause itself. We well know
how heavy the burthen is un the society; and
we grieve that our former sacrifices shoukl
have left us little else to offer other than our
personal exertions, We feel as we ought the
approbation you bestow on our conduct; and
we flatter ourselves, that our future behaviour

2F

will give you no reason to think your praise
prematurely bestowed. Since Sinclair’s depar-
ture nothing new has occurred, excepting the
formation of a society some where about the
Grampion Hills; they have already got the
intelligence that the convention mean to en-
lighten the Highlands; and they testify their
gratitude for our remembrance and our exer-
tions, and have already madc a subscription
towards it.—Again interrupted, and likely to
lose the post, unless I dispatch this immedi-
ately. Believe me fellow citizens, yours unto
death, “ Maurice Marcanor.”

“Pray, my worthy friend Hardy, did you
some weeks back receive an enclosed letter to
Preval? Did you likewise receive the papers

nesday the 10th instant? Have you done
any thing with that piece of paper? Have
you written to Norwich; and Moe they an-
swered you?—I have sent them news regu-
larly, but have not received a single letter
from them. Send them some fresh mode of
directing to me, or else let them send their
letters to you first—Pray question Sinclair

Mr. Thomas Maclean,—I found these two
papers in the possession of Mr. Adams.

Alexander Grant said he believed them to

“ London January 10, 1794.

“Citizen Adams;—The London Corres-

ponding Society begs the society for Constitu-

tional Information to accept of a few copies
of M. Margarot’s indictment.

“P.S. The London Corresponding So-

Addressed

Citizen Adams, sccretary to the Socicty for
Constitutional Information.”

“ London, January 11th, 1794.

« Fellow Citizens ;—I have just received a
letter from citizen Margarot at Edinburgh,
with some of the Edinburgh Gazettcers, where
you will see that citizen Skirving is found
guilty, and sentenced for fourteen years trans-
portation to Botany Bay. Margarot’s trial
comes nest, he meets it with great firmness
andresolution. I have no time to make my
comments on the proceedings, but I think
our opponents are cutting their own throats
as fastas they can. Now is the time for us
to do something worthy of men, the brave de-
tenders of liberty, south ef the English chan-
nel, are performing wonders, driving their
enemies Plone them like chatf befure the
whirlwind. Margarot tells me that he has
Not time to write to you just now, but he


hopes to have time very soon, when his trial
is over, and immured ina prison. The Lon-
don Corresponding Society is to have a gene-
ral meeting, and an anniversary dinner on
Monday the 20th instant at the Globe tavern,
Strand. I have sent you some of Margarot’s
and Skirving’s indictment, with two copies of
a pamphleton brewing; heis a member of our
society, the author; it you approve of it, you
may put it in practice, and be a great saving
to many families, also a diminution of the re-
venue, for every one brewing their own beer
pay no duty for it, excuse haste ; I still remain,

&e. (Signed) “Tuo. Harpy.”
James Davidson sworn.—Examined by Mr.
Garrow.

I believe you are a printer by business #—
Yes.
Were you employed at any time to print a
number of these papers?—Yes. .

When were you employed?—I believe it
was the 20th of February last.

By whom were you employed?—Thelwall
brought me the manuscript. 3

Was any body with him when he came
with it?—Yes, there was, but I do not recol-
lect who.

Were there more persons than one?—No.

What orders did he give F ia respecting it?
—Hedesired me to print o}

Mr. Erskine.—Is this evidence?

Mr. Garrow.—We submit that it is.

Mr. Erskine—Then I object to it, what
Mr. Thelwall said is no evidence against Mr.
Hardy.

Mr. Garrow.—{ submit to your lordsbtp
that it is the clearest evidence in the wor
after that which your lordships and the jury
have already heard. We have proved, by a
great variety of evidence, much of it under
the hand and signature of the prisoner now at
id lordship’s bar, much by papers found in

is custody at the time of his apprehension, a
clear connexion and conspiracy upon the sub-
ject of this high treason between Mir.
Thelwall and the prisoner. We therefore
submit to your lordships with confidence, but
with deference undoubtedly, that all the acts
of Mr. Thelwall, or any other person against
whom we have given evidence, fitto be sub-
mitted to the jury of their accession to the pe-
neral plan of the conspiracy, is clearly evidence
against every man charged with that conspi-
racy ; this therefore is an act of Mr. Thelwall’s ;
it is hardly worth discussing in this instance,
only that it is as well to do it the first time
that the objection arises; but we have other
evidence, such as the defendant’s paying for
the printing; but having given evidence of
Thelwall and Hardy being parties to the
neral conspiracy alleged as high treason, we
have a right to give in evidence any acts of
these conspirators relative to that object
against any of them.

Mr. Erskine.—There is no manner of doubt
that upon an indictment for a conspiracy, be

|
|
|

the conspiracy to do one act, or another act,
or be the quality of the act done, when it is
done, what it may, that as far as you can con-
nect persons acting together towards one pur-
puse, which purpose constitutes the crime, you
may undoubtedly involve them together by
evidence, but that is not the question here. I
wish to be understood that I have no anxiety
li the subject, because it isa printed paper
which has been in all our hands, and was yes-
terday stated at great length by Mr. Attorney
General in the course of his opening ; but it is
only that the proceedings may not be embar-
rassed in the course of them that makes me
interpose.

Mr. Thelwall gives a paper to this witness
to be printed, if my friend Mr. Garrow can
show that Mr. Hardy afterwards paid for the
printing of this paper, then this will be so
much time lost; but if that is not before your
Jordships, as it is not, there may be a ditfer-
ence in the quality of the act, by the procced-
ing farther to the printing a paper; for in-
stance, suppose this paper itself contained
something criminal, could your lordships
fasten that crime upon the prisoner, by Mr.
Thelwall’s having directed this gentleman to
print it? the knowing that a paper is printing,
and giving an authority to print it is different;
supposing that paper contained treason in it-
iat hich I know it does not, that might be
saa prea of treason, but could not be treason
itself, therefore I humbly apprehend that in
a criminal case of this enormous size your
lordsbips will not stretch the rules of evi-
dence, so as to allow it to be asked of this
witness, whether Mr. Thelwall did direct him
(the prisoner, Mr. Hardy, not being present)
to print that paper, the nature of which I do
not know.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—That is what I
was going to observe, the insisting on one
ide, and objecting on the other, is perfectly
Premature, for not knowing what the con-
tents of the paper are, the Court cannot judge
whether it is a branch of the evidence of the
general conspiracy, or something personal
with which the prisoner has nothing to do.

Mr. Garrow.—I take the liberty of stating
to the Court, that the ground and foundation
upon which I humbly submit to read this
Paper is, that it is an instrument to carry into

lect the general high treason charged in
this indictment. One stage or step of the
conspiracy being a paper to excite the subjects
of this country to desert their allegiance, and
in defiance of that allegiance to set about to
call a convention by force to assume the
power of the legislature. It is as an instru-
ment and a paper to carry that into effect that
we desire to read it.

Mr. Erskine.—Is your lordship to take that
from Mr. Garrow’s assertion?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—tIt is necessary
in order for the Court to judge whether it is
of the tendency you describe, to open to us
tbat part of the paper which you say has that


tendency. I have cast my eye over the paper,
and I see that there is a passage in it which
does go to the general object.

Mr. Grbbs.—I understand the point that
Mr. Garrow contends is this, that though Mr.
Hardy only is now upon trial, yet because
one overt act laid in the indictment is, that
papers were published, that for the purpose of
proving that overt act, part of a paper de-
ivered by Mr. Thelwall to be printed is to be
given in evidence against Mr. Hardy.

Mr. Garrow.—I shall not by any ingenuity
of my friend be drawn into the argument of
an abstract question, I forbore to state the
paper, lest it might be said I was giving the
effect of it; I will now state the passage which
I say demonstrates that it is of that quality,
“You may ask, perhaps, by what means
shall we seek redress? We answer, that men
in a state of civilized society are bound to
seek redress of the grievances from the laws
as long as any redress can be obtained by the
laws. But our common Master whom we
serve (whose law is a law of liberty, and
whose service is perfect freedom) has taught
us not to expect to gather grapes from thorns,
nor figs from thistles, We must have redress
from our own laws, and not from the laws of
our plunderers, enemies, and oppressors.
There is no redress tor a nation circumstanced
as we are, but ina fair, free, and full represen-
tation of the people.”

Now we allege and humbly insist that we
have given much evidence to show that the
purpose of this conspiracy, which is charged
to be high treason, was, by force to assume
the power of legislation, in despite of the con-
stituted authorities of the country, as they at
present happily exist here, by substituting a
convention of the people.

Mr. Erskine.—-Our objection is merely with
regard to this coming trom Mr. Thelwall ;
your lordship will dispose of it as you please,
I have no anxiety about it.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---This purports to
be a paper containing a resolution at a general
meeting of the London Corresponding So-
ciety, held at the Globe tavern; it is brought
to the printer by one of the members of that
society, the prisoner being another member of
that society, acting in that society as the secre-
tary; then they being both involved therefore
in the proceedings of that society, and this
being a printed paper produced by one of
them, it does seem to me that in a general
charge of a conspiracy this is evidence to
prove a circumstance in that conspiracy :
whether it will be ultimately so brought home
to the prisoner, Hardy, as that he should be
responsible for the guilt of having published
it, may be another consideration, but that it
is a branch of the conspiracy, and a circum-
stance occurring in it, the import of the paper
plainly proves. It does seem to me, theretore,
that it is admissible.

Mr. Garrow.---What directions did Mr,
Thelwall give you when he brought you

the manuecript for the purpose of printing ?-—
He told mc to print off two thousand and
then stop.

What were you to do with the two thou-
sand when you had printed them? ;

Mr. Gibbs.---Does your lordship think
that all the directions which Mr. Thelwall
gave, are to be received inevidence? =

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---Whether it is
two thousand, or what number, cannot be
material, it is the publication of an act of this
society.

Mr. Erskine.—Your lordship means that it
will have an application toevery member of
the Corresponding Society.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—-It applies to the
society, as far as relates to the general trans-
actions of that society, but as far as it may
constitute individual guilt, which may be se-
parated from the general guilt of the parties
to the general plan, that is another considera-
tion.

Mr. Garrow.---Did you print the number
ordered ?~- Not that day.

How soon did you print them ?~-I_ printed
two hundred of them that day, and carried
them to the Globe tavern; when I went to
the Globe tavern I met Mr. Hardy on the
stairs.

Did you know him before ?—Yes.

Were you a member of the society your-
self?—Yes.

You had then probably been present at
some of the meetings of the society.—I was
not at that meeting.

Had you been present at any meetings of
the society before you met Mr. Hardy upon
the stairs at the Globe tavern ?—Not some
time.

Had you ever seen him there ?-—Yes.

In what character did he act at the meetings ?
In the character of secretary.

What passed when you met him on the
stairs?—I told him I had brought two hundred
copie of the resolutions; he desired me to
take them back again, and not distribute one
of them; accordingly I went home with them,
and returned again to the Globe tavern to
dinner.

You said February, do you mean February
or January ?—-I am not sure to the month.

Was it on the day at which the reso-
lutions were come to?—The day of the meet-
ing.

a what time of the day was it that you
saw Mr. Thelwall when he brought you the
copy ?-—~It was, I believe, between one and two
o'clock.

At what time was it that you carried the
two hundred copies to the Globe tavern ?~-
Between four and five.

You returned home with these two hundred
by the direction of Mr. Hardy, and came back
to the Globe tavern to dinner ?--Yes.

At what time was that ?—-At pretty nigh
six o'clock.

Were you present at the time these resolu-


tions were proposed in the society?--No, I
was not.

Was it on the day upon which the resolu-
tions purport by Mr. Thelwall’s paper to be
come to, that you went to the Globe tavern,
or amonth after ?--I had the copy on the
am and delivered the two hundred on the
20th.

Look at the paper, and tell us whether
it was January or February; is the date cor-
rect ?---Yes.

Then do you believe it was the 18th of
January, and not the 18th of February, upon
which you had the copy ?—Yes, I see now
that it was January.

Have you any doubt of that ?—None.

When you returned again, was it to a pri-
vate dinner or a public dinner of the society ?
—A public dinner, every one paid for- his
ticket.

Was there any chairman at the dinner?
did you see any person in the chair?—I am
not very sure, I think Mr. ‘Thelwall was in
the chair, but I am not sure.

Was Mr. Hardy there ?—Yes, he was.

When you returned to dinner, did you
carry any copies of the paper you had print-
ed with you ?—No, F did not.

What did you do with these copies after-
wards ?—Somebody was sent for them to my
house.

Where from ?—Frum the Globe tavern.

From the meeting ?—Yes.

Were they brought to the meeting?—They
were.

What was done with them there?—I saw
only one of them.

Where did you sce that? — Somebody
handed it round the table, I am sure I do not
krow who it was.

How many persons might there be assem-
bled at that meeting ?—I dare say there were
about three hundred or thereabouts, as near.
as I could guess.

How late did you stay ?—Till ten o'clock,
or thereabouts.

Did you print any more of them at any
time ?—Yes.

When?—I cannot be particular to the time,
T printed in the course of that week, I believe,
a thousand more.

By whose order?—Mr. Thelwall’s order
was to print two thousand; I completed the
two thousand according to his original order.

What did you do with them when you had
printed them?—I carried a good many of
them to Mr. Hardy’s.

What did you do with the rest?—People
came for some now and then.

What people?—Some of the members of
the London Corresponding Society came for
them.

And did you deliver them as they came for
them ?—Yes, some asked for a dozen, or half
a dozen or so, and I delivered them.

Did you print any more than the two thou-
sand which Mr. Thelwall originally ordered?

--To the best of my recollection I printed
six thousand more. ;

By whose orders did you print them ?—TI
believe Mr. Hardy gave me orders to go on
with them till I should be desired to stop.

Were you ever desired to stop, and when?
—I was desired to stop, I believe, in the
month of March.

Did you go on printing them till the
month of March ?—I fia now and then occa-
sionally as they were wanted. .

How many thousand might you print in
all ?—Eight thousand.

Who paid you for them?—They are not
paid for yet.

On whose credit did you print them? did
any body at any time promise to pay you for
them ?—No.

Had you any conversation with Mr. Hardy
about being paid for them?—No, I had not,
no farther than I put them down to the cre-
dit of the society.

Who desired you to do that ?—-He did not
desire me; but he, as treasurer, was to receive
the moncy, and see the debts of the society

aid.
Who was ?— Mr. Hardy.
Did you make the society debtor for them?
Yes, I did.
Have you printed upon other occasions for
the society ?—I have.
Who paid you?—Mr. Hardy.

“AT A GENERAL MEETING

“ op THE
*« LONDON CORRESPONDING SOCIETY,
“ Held at the Grose Tavern, Strand,
“On MONDA Ythe on Day of JANUARY,
“1794.

“CITIZEN JOHN MARTIN, 1n THE
CHAIR.

“The following Appress to the Prorte of
Great Britain and Ireland, was read
and agreed to.

, © Cinzens ;—We find the nation involved
im a war, by which, in the course of ONE
Campaign, immense numbers of our coun-
trymen have been slaughtered; a vast ex-
pense has been incurred, our Trade, Com-
terce and Manufactories, are almost de-
‘ stroyed, and many of our Manufacturers and
Artists are ruined, and their families starving.
“To add to our affliction, we have reason
to expect, that other taxes will soon be added
to the intolerable load of imposts and impo-
sitions with which we are already over-
whelmed; for the purpose of defraying the
expenses which have been incurred, in a
fruitless crusade, to re-establish the odious
despotism of France.
“When we contemplate the principles of


this war, we confess ourselves to be umabké to
approve of it, as a measure, either of justice
or discretion ;—and if we are to form our cal-
culation of the result, from what has already
passed, we can only lock forward to defeat
and the eternal disgrace of the British name.

“ While we are thus engaged in an expen-
sive and rumous and foreign war; our state
at home is not less deplorable.

“ We are every day told, by those persons
who are interested in supporting the Corrup-
tion List, and an inmumerable Host of Sinecure
Placemen, that the Constitution of England,
is the perfection of human wisdom; that our
laws (we should rather say, TaErr laws) are
the perfection of justice; and that their Ad-
ministration of those laws is so impartial and
so ready, as to afford an equal remedy, both
to the rich and to the poor; by means of
which, we are said to be placed in a state of
absolute freedom, and that our Rights and
Liberties are so well secured to us as to ren-

der all invasion of them impossible.

“ When we ask, how we enjoy these trans-
cendant privileges; we are referred to
MAGNA CHARTA, and the BILL of
RIGHTS; and the glorious REVOLUTION
in the ig 1688, is held out to us, as the
bulwark of British liberty.

“ Cit1zens;—We have referred to Magna
Charta, to the Bill of Rights, and to the Re-
volution, and we certainly do find that our
ancestors did establish wise and wholesome
laws: but we as certainly find, that, of the
venerable Constitution of our ancestors, hardly
a vestige remains.

“ The only Chapters of the Great Charter,
which are now in legal existence, are the
14th and 29th.

“The important provision of the 14th
Chapter, runs thus:

“© A Freeman shall not be amerced for a
smal! fault, but after the manner of the faut ;
and for a great fault after the’ greatness
thereof, saving to him his contenement ; and
a Merchant likewise, saving to him his mer-
chandize ; and any other’s villain than ours
shall be likewise amerced, saving to him his
wainage; And none of the said amerciaments
shall be assessed, but by the oath of honest
and lawful men of the Victnage.’

“ But by the usurped power of the judges,
in assessing Fines (and what Fines !!) in the
cases of Misdemeanor; this glorious Right
of the Subject, of having these fines assessed
by the Jury (the only possible protection
from slavery and the vilest oppression), is
unjustly fat infamously ravished from us.

“The provision of the 29th chapter, runs
thus :

“ «No Freeman shall be taken or impri-
soned, or be disseised of his freehold, or li-
berties, or free customs, or be outlawed, or
exiled, or any otherwise destroyed, nor we
will not pass upon him, nor condemn him,
but by the lawful judgment of his peers, or
by the law of the land.” We will sell to no

man, we will not deny, or defer to any man,
either justice or right.’

“The various methods now in constant

tice by which the benefits of this provi-
sion are totally defeated and destroyed, might
induce us to suppose, that the GREAT
CHARTER has been repealed ; if we did not
assuredly know, that it is the fundamental
basis of our constitution; which even the
REAL representatives of the people (much
less the miserable nominees of HELSTUNE
and OLD SARUM) have not the right, nor
(as we trust it will be found by experience)
the POWER to repeal. Yet what do we find
in practice? Unconstitutional and illegal IN-
FORMATIONS EX OFFICIO, that 1s, the
arbitrary will of the king's Attorney General,
usurping the oflice of the ACCUSING Jury;
and the interested oath of a vile common
informer, with the judsment of as vile a com-
mon trading or pensioned justice, substituted
in the room of our birthright, an impartial
trial by our country.

Add to this, that the exorbitant expense of
judicial proceedings, the novel practice of
arbitrarily and repeatedly annulling the ver-
icts of Juries, and the dilatory practice of
the courts, most openly and shamefully con-
tradict the clause which forbids the denial,
the delay, and the sale of justice,

“ A man accused of Fetony (for which by
the comnion law of England, his life and
goods are forfeited) may be bailed on finding
two sureties for forty pounds each; but upon
a charge of MISDEMEANOUR by words
only, bail to the amount of ONE. THOU-
SAND POUNDS has been demanded.

“Upon conviction also, for such misde-
meanour, enormous fines, long and cruel im-
prisonments unknown to our ancient laws,
and unsanctioned by any new statutes, have
of late (and but of late) been too frequently
and too oppressively inflicted. And all this,
although by this bill of rights it is declared,
that ‘ excessive bail shall not be demanded,
“nor cruel and unusual punishments in-
© flicted.’

“ If we look to IRELAND we find that ac-
knowledged privilege of the people, to meet
for the support and protection of their rights
and liberties, is attempted, by terror, to be
taken away by a late infamous act of parlia-
ment: hilst titles of honour! No, but of
dishonour, are lavished; and new sources of
corruption opened, to gratify the greedy pros-
titution of those, who are the instruments of
this oppression.

“In SCOTLAND, the Wicked Hand of
Power has been impudently exerted, without
even the wretched formality of an act of
Parliament, Magistrates have furcibly intruded
into the peaceful and lawful meetings of
Freemen; and, by force (not only without
law, but against law), have, under colour of
magisterial office, interrupted thcir delibera-
tions, and prevented their association.

“The wisdom and good conduct of the


BRITISH CONVENTION at Edinburgh,
has been such, as to defy their bitterest ene-
mies to name the law which they have
broken ; notwithstanding which, their papers
have been seized, and made use of as evidence
against them, and many virtuous and merito-
rious individuals, have been, as cruelly as
unjustly for their virtuous actions disgraced
and destroyed by infamous and illegal sen-
tences of transportation. And these unjust
and wicked judgments have been executed
with a rancour and malignity, never before
known in this land; our respectable and be-
loved Fellow-citizens have been cast Fer
TERED into Dungeons amongst felons in the
Hulks, to which they were not sentenced.

“ Citizens ;—We all approve the senti-
ments, and are daily repeating the words, for
which these our respectable and valuable bre-
thren are thus unjustly and inhumanly suf-
fering. We too, associate in order to obtain
a fair, free, and full representation of the
ple in a house of real national representatives.
Are we also willing to be treated as Fetons,
for claiming this our inherent right, which we
are determined never to forego but with om
lives, and which none but thieves and traitors
can wish to withhold from us? Consider, it
is one and the same corrupt and corrupting
influence which at this time domineers in
Ireland, Scotland, and England. Can you be-
lieve that those who send virtuous Irishmen,
and Scotchmen fettered with felons to Botany
Bay, do not meditate and will not attempt to
seize the first moment to send us after them?
Or, if we had not just cause to apprehend the
Same inhuman treatment; if instead of the
most imminent danger, we were in perfect
safety from it; should we not disdain to enjo
any liberty or privilege whatever, in whi
our honest Irish and Scotch brethren did not
oquatly and as fully participate with us?
Their cause then and ours is the same. And
it is both our duty and our interest to stand or
fall together. ‘The Irish parliament and the
Scotch judges, actuated by the same English
influence, have brought us directly to the
point. There is no farther step beyond that
which they have taken. We are at issue.
We must now choose at once either liberty or
slavery for ourselves and our posterity. Will
you wait till BARRACKS are erected in every
village, and till subsidized Hessians and Hano-
veriais are upon us?

“You may ask perhaps, by what means
shall we seek redress ?

“ We answer, that men ina state of civi-
lized society are bound to seek redress of the
puevances from the laws; as long as any re-

ress can be obtained by the laws. But our
common Master whom we serve (whose law is
a law of liberty, and whose service is perfect
freedom) has taught us not to expect to gather
grapes from thorns, nor figs from thistles. We
must have redress from our own laws and not
from the laws of our plunderers, enemies, and
oppressors,

“ THERE IS NO REDRESS FOR A NA-
TION CIRCUMSTANCED AS WE ARE,
BUT IN A FAIR, FREE, AND FULL RE-
PRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE.

“ RESOLVED, that during the ensuing
session of parliament, the general committee
of this society do meet daily, for the purpose
of watching the proceedings of the parliament
and of the administration of the government of
this country. And that upon the first intro-
duction of any bill, or motion inimical to the
liberties of the people, such as, for LAND-
ING FOREIGN TROOPS IN GREAT-BRI-
TAIN or IRELAND, for suspending the
HABEAS CORPUS ACT, for proclaiming
MARTIAL LAW, OR FOR PREVENTING
THE PEOPLE FROM MEETING IN SO-
CIETIES for CONSTITUTIONAL INFOR-
MATION, or any OTHER INNOVATION
ofa similar nature, that, on any of these
emergencies, the general committce shall is-
sue summonses to the delegates of each divi-
sion, and also to the secretarics of the different
societies affiliated and corresponding with
this society, forthwith to call a GENERAL
CONVENTION of the PEUPLE, to be held at
such place and in such a manner as shall be
specified in the summons, for the purpose of
taking such measures into their consideration.

“ Resolved, that the preceding Address and
Resolution be signed by the chairman, and
printed and published.

J. MARTIN, cuarrman.

dred thousand copies of the address to the
people of Great Britain and Ireland, voted at

demned delegate of this society; and may his
manly and patrivtic conduct be rewarded by

“ Citizen Gerrald then arose, and in a
stream of inspiring eloquence, pronounced the
just eulogium of this truly valuable citizen, so
emphatically called by Citizen Aitcheson (one
of the witnesses on his trial) the SECOND

Mr. Garrow to Daridson.—You said you
were a inember of the London Corresponding
Society; do you know John Martin?—Not
much, I have only spoke to him two or three
times,

Where did you see him:—I saw him once
in his own house.

Was he a member of the London Corres-
ponding Society ?—I am not sure of that—I
cannot prove tliat.

Did you ever sce him at any of the mee
ings of that society ?—Yes; I have.

as he there at the meeting that you have
now been speaking of at the Globe tavern ?—
I saw him there.

That you have told us was a meeting of
that society ?—Yes.

Was Martin then amember of that Society?
—I cannot say whether he was a member or
not.

Did any body attend that were not members


at the meetings of the. society ?—I do not
know,

Upon your oath did you ever know any per-
sons attend the meetings of the society that
were not members of the society ?—There
might be many that were not.

pon your oath did you ever know any
body attend them but the members? Was
the business that you were with Mr, Martin
upon, at his house, relative to the London
Corresponding Society ?—It was.

What was its nature ?—Relative to the lat-
ter part of the toasts and sentiments printed
at the back of that paper.

What passed between you and Mr. Martin
respecting the latter part of the paper ?—I
told him that I thought there were some hard
words in some of the resolutions and toasts.
He said, No; it was all constitutional, and
there was no danger could arise from it.

Was that between the 18th and 20th, or
after the meeting?—It was the 21st, I be-
lieve, which happened on Tuesday.

The day after the meeting ?—It was either
the 2ist or the 2¢nd.

I do not know whether you printed this?—

[Showing the witness a printed paper.]

No.; I never saw it.

One of the Jury—You have not told us yet
whether you knew that there was any one in-
dividual who attended those meetings that
was not a member ?—There might be.

Jurymun.—You have positively said to the
contrary ; endeavour to recollect if there were

not.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Do they never
admit visitors ?—Yes ; they do.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—There are visi-
tors spoken of ?—There were tickets, I under-
stand, to be given at the bar to any body that
chose to call for them, or pay for them.

Mr. Garrow.—That applies to the dinner at
the Globe?—Yes.

In the division meeting could any person
who chose to ask for a acket, without being
introduced by a member as a visitor, obtain
it3—No.

The Rev. Richard Williams sworn.—Examin-
ed by Mr. Garrow.

. Do you know Mr. Thelwall ?—Yes.,
_ Are you acquainted with his manner of
writing ?—Yes,

Look at this, and tell me whether you be-
lieve this to be his hand-writing (showing a
letter ta the wiiness].—I believe the signa-
ture to be his.

Mr. Garrow.—My lords, I will state the

rounds on which we offer this letter as evi-
Bence against the prisoner. We have already
given evidence to prove that Mr. Thelwall was
not only a member of the London Corres-
ponding Society, but that in the publication
of the resolutions passed at the anniversary
meeting, and their toasts, he acted as the
agent of the society. I now propose to read


a letter of Mr. Thelwall’s, as a farther act of
that agency. The letter purports to have con-
tained several of these addresses ; it purports,
and it will appear likewise by the proof, te
have contained several seditious songs,stated to
have been composed and sung by Mr. Thel-
wall at that meeting, which we allege to be
another, perhaps a subordinate and inferior
branch atthat conspiracy which was to bring
all the constituent authorities in the country
into contempt, so as to mature the public mind
for that great change which we slate to have
been the ultimate object of the society. We
submit to your lordships, that any act of Mr,
Thelwall’s, so in furtherance of this cunspira-
cy, is evidence against the defendant. It
also gives an account of the state of the other
affiliated societies in different parts of the
world. I cannot state it better than in the
language of the letter :— London is not the
only place that is alive: Scotland is full of
liberty boys.” Sheffield and many other
towns are mentioned as being ina state of
expectation for that great catastrophe which
they all looked to about this period.

Mr. Erskine—Mr. Thelwall appears to have
been an agent for the publication of this ad-
dress, which turns out to be an act of the
society, and to have ended in a dinner at
which these toasts were drank. But the dif-
ficulty with me is this: if they could show
that songs were actually sung at this meeting,
which songs were indecent, or that they, in
your lordship’s mind, or the opinion of the
Jury, bear at all upon this case, I should not
object in the smallest degree to these songs
being read; but I very much doubt whether
any account by Mr. Thelwall of these songs
having been sung, can be evidence against
Mr, Ifardy. What an agent docs is one thing,
what an agent says has been done is quite
another thing; nor will the construction
which Mr. Thelwall may put upon these be
at all evidence against Mr. Hardy.

Mr. Thelwall inay, notwithstanding he acts
for these societics, have some view of his own ;
not that I impute any such to him, because E
am of counsel for him in the indictment that
will be afterwards tried against him; but A,
B, C, D, E, F,—all the letters of the alphabet
may meet for objects which they may all
league in and be connected together, and if
criminal, all criminal. But a declaration of
one man, supposing he drives atany particular
| object, and he makes use of any particular
| language to express his mind with regard to
that object, cannot, I humbly submit, be evi-
dence against the prisoner. As far forth most
| undoubtedly as all the acts of the society are
piven in evidence, as far forth as any thing
bas been said in the presence of Mr. Hardy
at meetings he attended, all these are eve
dence against him, and so is every thing that
Mr. Thelwall does in this partial agency ;
for Mr. Garrow has not established hin ‘to
be the universal agent of Mr. Hardy, but only
has proved bim to be the agent for procuring
the printing of a particular paper.


Mr. Gibbs.—We can have no anxiety to
fesist the evidence that is now offered, except
that if it be received we know not where it
imay end. The question which your lord-
ships and the jury are now to try, is, whether
Mr. Hardy has compassed the king’s death,
and whether he has done any of the acts
charged in the indictment as overt acts in the
prosecution of that design. The evidence
offered now fo your lordships to prove this,
is, that Mr. Thelwall, who is charged in the
indictment to have ee in the same con-
. Spiracies that are alleged against Mr. Hardy,
that Mr. Thelwall, not by any communication
with Mr. Hardy, not in consequence of any
peso scheme between him and Mr.

jardy, did write this letter.
~ Now with respect to any thing that passed
at the meeting at which Mr. Hardy was, with

t to any thing that was done by any
other person directed and instructed by Mr.
Hardy to do that thing, we admit that those
things which passed at the society in Mr.
Har . '$ presence, and that any thing which
twas done by another person, by the direction
of Mr. Hardy, gould be evidenee against
Hardy ; but to what point in the indictment
the letter written by Mr. Thelwall, of which it
is not proved that Mr. Hardy ever had any
knowledge, is directed, I confess I cannot see.
The three questions are, first, Whether Mr.
Hardy compassed the king's death; second,
Whether he committed any of the acts which
are stated as overt acts; and, third, Whether
he committed them in the prosecution of a
design upon the king’s life. I take it, that a
letter written by Thelwall, without the know-
ledge of Hardy, cannot be evidence of the act
of Hardy’s mind, namely, compassing the
king’s death ; therefore, it cannot be evidence
tpon the first ground.

With respect to the existence of the acts
that are laid as overt acts, they must be proved
Specifically upon al] the prisoners in the in-
dictment. The present trial is only of Mr.
Hardy. The present question is, Whether he
Gid any of these acts. Then the declaration
of another man, whether by word of mouth

or by letter, cannot prove the fact upon Mr.
: Hardy.

7,

Then, suppose the acts proved, the third
thing to be proved is, that the act was done
in the prosecution of a design upon the king’s
life; then, nothing that is said, written, or
done by a third person, without the authority
of Mr. Hardy, ean Rue that Mr. Hardy meant
to produce the effect which it is imputed to
him he meant to produce; namely, the de-
struction of the king. Therefore I submit,
that this letter written by Mr. Thelwall does
not appear to conduce to the proof of either of
the three things imputed by this indictment;
wamely, That he compassed the king’s death;
that he in point of fact committed any of the
acts stated in the indictment as overt acts of
that design; os supposing that he committed
them, that any of ihese acts were direeted to


the design of compassing the king’s death. I
submit, that upon neither of these grounds is
this letter admissible against Mr Hardy, and
therefore ought not to be received in evidence.
I wish to repeat, that it is not from any
anxiety we feel with respect to this letter, but
because we wish that a rule should not be
established in a casé upon perhaps indifferent
points, as a precedent for others that may ope<
rate materially in the cause. ‘

Lord Chief Baron Macdonald.—To whom is
the letter addressed ?

Mr. Garrow.—Yo a person of the name. of
Vellam.

ft certainly is not in my power to judge of
the anxiety of my learned friends about the
consequences of producing this letter, except
as that anxiety induces them to object to its
being read. It appears, that they are appre+
hensive of the effect and tendency of this
letter, because they have made all the obser-
vations that occurred to them on the effect
and tendency of this letter; and I am sure
they will do me the justice to believe, that I
mean no offence to them when I say I cannot
discern any thing that is not justly, to be des-
cribed to be argument upon the effect and
tendency of the letter, which is argument ta
he addressed to the jury. We conceive it is
fit to be received in evidence, in order to cons
vince the jury that this was done as a part of
the agency of ‘Thelwall. But if we are not
able to make it out in that way, we insist that
the publishing by a larger circle that which
was ordered to be printed for general publica-
tion, is clear evidence, being in furtherance of
the general conspiracy.

My friends seem to suppose that they can
limit the acts of those who are not at presentat
the bar, for consideration to things done either
by themselves or their express order. We
are very much mistaken if that be the rule of
law. We humbly apprehend, that without

revious concert as to the particolar fact done
A. A. not being then upon his trial, if B.
should have done the act, having been proved
before to be a party to the general conspiracy,
to be carried into effect by divers means and
various instruments, that it is fit to receive
evidence of the acts of all the parties to that
conspiracy, in furtherance of that generak
design ; for instance, it is not required that,
in order to give evidence, that a conspirator
hired his horse at a particular place, the hirin
of which would connect him with the general
conspiracy, the ground having been made, it
is not necessary to show that he, to the
person then trying, had communicated that
he meant to go there to hire a horse; but the
fact of his having done it is an accession to
the general purposes of the conspiracy. All
the acts of these persons, limiting it to the
objects of the conspiracy, not extending it
to crimes of another dye or character, but i
furtherance of the general design of the grad
conspiracy, we insist, coming from whom they
may, whether it be the party upon: trial,
9G

whether it be in consequence of the orders
given by him, whether communieated before
or after, are evidence receivable, subject un-
doubtedly to the observations to be made
upon their greater or lesser effect.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I confess I have
great doubt myself whether this evidence
ought to be admitted. 1 agree, that where
several persons are proved to be engaged ir
one general conspiracy, that all the transac-
tions of that conspiracy by the different par-
fies, may and ought to be given in evidence ;
and it is enough if the party accused at this
time can be proved to be-privy to that general
conspiracy ; for if that is proved, every thin
that is done by the different parties concern:
in it, must be also imputed to him asa ah
of the transaction of that conspiracy. I
understand this letter, it is nothing more than
Mr. Thelwall’s account to a private friend, of
a part which he had taken respecting this
paper, and of his having composed songs.
And I remember another passage in it, which
is very material as against Thelwall, but, in
T™y mind, should be reserved till it comes to
the time when Thelwall’s own declarations
come to be proper evidence.

I doubt whether we ought to consider this
Racal letter as any thing more than Mr.

helwall’s declaration; and Thelwall’s decla-
ration ought not to be evidence of any thing
which, si remotely connected with this
plot, yet still does not amount to any transac-
tion done in the course of the plot, for the
furtherance of the plot, but is a mere recital
of his, a sort of confession of his of some part
that he had taken. It appears+to me, that
that is not like the evidence which we before
admitted of a fact done by Mr. Thelwall in
carrying the papers and delivering them to the
printer, which is a part of the transaction
itself. His account of that transaction seems
to me to stand quite upon a different footing.
It seems just the same as an act which shall
bind a man, because he is connected with
the person that did the act; and his declara-
tion, which shall not bind him, because it is
no part of the act.

Mr. Garrow.—He says, “ You will also
receive enclosed several copies of Addresses
published by the society.” It is upon that

‘ound I submit it to your lordship.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—To be sure, as
far as the transmission of these papers go, it
does stand upon another footing; but I should
be sorry if the letter was to be read for so im-
material a purpose, as that is only to introduce
something which in my mind ought not to be
evidence in this case.

Mr, Justice Buller.—I am strongly inclined
to think, that this letter is evidence, and
ought to be received. There are two things
to be considered in an indictment of this sort.
First, Whether any conspiracy exists; next,
What share the prisoner took in that con-

iracy.

It appears to me, that when we are consj-


yse
dering the first question, any thing that
passed from any person who is proved to be a
party in the conspiracy ought to be received
as evidence, and it is received for the purpose
of showing what was the extent and nature of
the conspiracy. Now if the case stood merely
upon this ground, that Thelwall, one of the’
conspirators, had said their object was so and
so, that, I take it, would be evidence; it bas
been admitted, I conceive, in a variety of
cases that have happened upon similar ques-
tions with the present. In Dammaree and
Purchase’s cases evidence was received of
what some of the parties had done when the
prisoner was not there. The attorney general
says, I calI_ this witness, not to speak in par-
ticular to the prisoner, but to shew the inten-
tion of the mob.* On the trial of lord South-
ampton something said by lord Essex, previous
to the prisoner’s being, there, was admitted as
evidence. In the cases that have happened,
in our own time, in Jord George Gordon’s
case,® evidence of what different persons of the
mob had said, though he was not there, was
admitted. In all the cases at St. Margaret’s-
hill, the same thing was admitted, and with a
view of showing what was the design then on
foot, which is a very distinct question from
the question of whether the prisoner was or
not concerned to the extent that others might
have been. As Mr. Garrow states this letter,
it seems to me to have that effect, for it shews
what some of the parties at least intended by
meetings they had held, and what they pro-
posed to effect. In that light, therefore, it
seems tome to be evidence. But before it
can affect the prisoner materially, it is neces-
sary to make out Snother point, namely, that
he consented to the extent that the others
did; but still, while we are upon the question
as to the design, it appears to me that any
thing that haa eet said, still more any thing
that has been written by the conspirators,
ought to be received in evidence, to prove
what that design was. , ;

Mr. Justice Grose.—I must confess, I have
very great doubts upon this subject. The
majority of the cuurt is for rejecting the evi-
dence. It does seem to me, I must confess,
at least very doubtful whether it ought to be
rejected; for it appears to me, that this is
evidence of what the parties meant by whag
was done at a place where both these parties
were present, and both members of one
society, and professedly concerned in one
plan; it is therefore very material to hear
what either of them says respecting this plan,
for there is mo doubt about it that these
papers are respecting this plan, to show the
extent of the plan, and the intention, the
animus with which these rele met, and were
publishing these papers; therefore, in ‘that
light, I must confess, what my brother Buller

15, p. 553.

has said has struck me very much. But, ex-
dlusive of that, from the beginning ‘the incli-
nation of my opinion was and is, that it is evi-
dence.

‘Lord Chief Baron Macdonald.—It is cer-
tainly a case that has a great dead of doubt
attending it; but at the same time I can
hardly bring my own mind to consider this as
falling within Mr. Garrow’s own definition.
It must be something in furtherance of the
conspiracy. I agree, that any act done by
one, is, to a certain extent, imputable to
another; that is, it may be given in evidence
to show the general conspiracy in which ‘he
‘was engaged; but an act done, appears to
me to be different from the mere relation of it
by another person, a mere relation of what
passed given by one in a private letter to
another. I have much doubt whether it is
evidence that ought to be received. 1 am,
myselt, inclined to reject it.

Mr.’ Baron Hotham.—I am of the same

inion as my lord chief justice and my lord

ief baron. I do not think this is evidence
Syte be received. I do not think itisa part

the transaction of the plan to be carried
into execution. I consider it as a mere rela-
tion of what has passed, which, if it is to affect
the prisoner, ought to be confined to the real
fact that happened at the time to which this
relation alludes. Llowever, there is no evidence
to prove that what is stated for a fact in this
letter, by which the prisoner is to be impli-
cated, actually did happen.

Lord Chiet Justice Eyre.—After having
heard my lord chief baron and my brothers
upon it, I really am of opinion that #t is too
questionable to received as evidence, ex-
cept upon the ground last stated by Mr. Gar-
row, upon which (if he insists on it) it must
be received.

Mr. Garrow.—Certainly not.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—In the cases of
Dammarce and lord George Gordon, the cry
of the mob at the time made a part of the
fact, of the transaction, therefore I have no
doubt that such evidence ought to be received ;
but I confess I have so great a doubt upon
the admissibility of this letter, that I prefer


Mr. Solicitor General_—My lord, I should
have no idea of pressing this, but mercly
with a view to similar questions which may
arise ————.

Mr. Erskine.—They will be discussed when
they arise.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Correspondence
Mid often makes a part of the transaction,
and where correspondence makes a part of
the transaction, the correspondence of one
man who is a party in a conspiracy, would
undoubtedly be evidence, correspondence in
furtheranee of the plot: a correspondence of
a private nature, a mere relation of what had
been done, appears a different thing.

* Mr. Garrow.—

lord, I now proj to
Jead a letter upon the principle of Nes Wan &

correspondence between one of the persons
proved to have been a party in the conspiracy,

and another person at a distant part of t
kingdom, likewise proved to be a party in the
conspiracy: it is a letter from Mr. Martin,
after the dinner at the Globe tavern, to Mr,
Margarot, who was at that time in custody in
the Tolbooth, at Edinburgh, having been one
of the persons apprehended by the magistracy
at Edinburgh, as a part of that British Con-
vention whom the magistracy dispersed. The
letter is in terms calculated to excite the
spirit of the brethren of the North: it hke-
wise contains a declaration of the universal
approbation of the conduct of those delegates
in the North, and it states other circumstances
of a public nature ;—the maner in which his
majesty had met Ais parliament, as it is stated
—the manner in which his majesty is stated
by this writer to have been received by the
people, and insulted, and his life endangered,
as this writer states it, still poing on with a
view to.excite and encourage them in a distant
part of the kingdom, by disseminating the
same doctrines, which, in .London, these
people disseminated.

Mr. Erskine.—I apprehend that this letter,
upon no principle, can be evidence; T shalf
not draw the Court at all into the construction
of the statute of king Edward the third, at this
moment; the prisoner is upon his deliverance
on the general issue, and I shall address your
lordships and the jury upon that subject in
due season: at present, I shall content myself
with saying what has been said twice to-day
already ; first in the morning by myself, after=
wards by my friend who sits by me, that this
isan indictment for compassing and imagining
the death of the king; and that there are
overt-acts stated in the indictment, which are
laid as acts done in pursuance of, and. in ac>
complishment of—or to use the language of
the indictment, to fulfil the traitorous inten-
tion, which is the charge upon the record.

It is impossible for my friends to go farther
than to contend, by these acts, that they
involve in themselves, as they are pleased to
say, a forcible subversion of the government
of the country, which would involve in it as a
consequence, the death of the king, and that
therefore it is an overt-act, or, in other words,
relevant evidence to prove the criminal inten-
tion, which is the subject matter of this in-
dictment. But your lordships permit, and
ought to permit, t allow, any other acts of the
prisoner, to be given in evidence, which
decypher his mind to the jury; any expressions
of his own, any thing that he has said, any
thing that he has done, which points directly
and relevantly to the purpose of this indict-
ment; for I hope your lordships will never
cease to recollect, that the crime charged upon
the record, is the compassing the death of the
king, and that the overt-act is the means the
defendant is charged to have made use of in
the accomplishment of that criminal apd de-
testable purpose. :

Then let. us see the danger of allowing the
letter of a man, who is not charged even upon
this record, as a conspirator with the prisoner
at the bar: Mr. Martin has had a bill found
against him, which of course we know nothing
of—we only read of itin the neswspapers; but
we, who are of counsel for the prisoner, are
counsel for hit as having engaged in a con-
spiracy with the other prisoners now in New-

ate, and with other persons to the jurors un-
known, for the purpose of sceorapliehing this
detestable apie of destreying the king;
and your lordships will see what a pretty
piece of work you are cutting out for your-
selves, if this evidence be admitted. Any
thing that Mr. Martin says, or writes, can,
upon no principle of common sense (to leave
law out of the question), be considered as evi-
dence to criminate any body, except as he is a
member of the Corresponding Society, which,
by-the-by, he is not yet proved to be—————

Mr. Garrow.—Davison proved that he was
a member

Mr. Erskine—We will take Mr. Martin,
for argument sake, to be a member of the
Corresponding Society. I shall be glad to
Know upon what principle can your lordships
fo out of the overt-acts charged in the indict-
ment; upon what poeple upon earth can
you go beyund evidence of the direct conspi-
racy charged upon the defendant, but upon
this wholesome ground, which we do not
stand here to contradict, namely, that any
thing which can decypher the mind of the
prisoner to the jury, from whence they can
collect that he intended the death of the king,
may be evidence against him; then, according
to that, any members of the Corresponding
Society whom you could have brought together
when Mr. Hardy was not speal ing of the
king, when he was not reviling the king, or
attempting any thing that could lead to his
Majesty’s death, unless, according to the
argument which we heard at large, yesterday,
of certain consequences which were to arise
from the representation of the people in par
liament—it would render that innocent man
at the bar, as I have aright to style him until
the jury have pronounced a contrary verdict —
it would make him answerable for every
wicked thing that any man has said, or that
any man has written.
~ I collect from what fell from Mr. Garrow,
but still more from the opening of this letter,

yesterday, by the attorney-general, that Mr.

artin writes, in some flippant manner, of a
pattcn being thrown at his majesty, upon his
return from his erlement (o bick, by-the-by,
is the style and pees of the law, for it is
his parliament); but, if Mr. Martin chooses
to express himself in a contemptuous manner
either of the king or of his parliament, and if
that is to be evidence to decypher the mind of
any body, it is evidence to decypher the mind
of Mr. Martin, not of Mr. Hardy. Do not
common sense, common honour, and common
justice, revolt alike at it? We have got names


we cannot help, because in a court of justice
we sometimes talk of a plot and sometimes of
a conspiracy ; but I say, that all that has been
laid before your lordships to-day and yester-
day, amounts no matter to what, I am not to
pronounce the law, it is the Court—but
amounts to an assembly of a great numt-er of
peuple in ditferent parts of this island, all pur-
suing one purpose. Your lordships will recol-
lect, that the conspiracy, if it is to be called a
conspiracy, does not exist in the members of
the Corresponding Sacicty alone, for the ac-,
complishment of this purpose; they corres-
ponded with Sheffield—they corresponded with _
Manchester, with Leeds, with Norwich, with
Dumfermline, with Edinburgh, and with a
great number of other places. According to
the doctrine now contended for, the declara-
tion of every man, not the declaration of
what his olject was—it has not been stated
that any of them said, “ the object of all our
meetings is to destroy the king ;” but jf any
absurd, intemperate man, drunk or sober,
chooses to utter an express contemptuous
of the king, that is to be evidence to decy pher
Mr. Hardy’s mind. I do not stand up to ap-
prove of any man’s uttering any contemptuous
expression of the sort; but if Mr. Martin has
uttered such an expression, when Mr. Martin
is upon his trial, the good sense of the jury
will consider how far such an expression as
that will weigh as against hin; but I enter
my solemn protest ya this being given as
evidence to affect Mr. Hardy. My lords,
toust needs do so, when I heard an expression
imputed yesterday in the opening, by the
attorney-general, in this cause, to another
person.—Suppose, for instance, any man of al},
that society, should say an intemperate, an
absurd, or a criminal thing: why now, for
instance, suppose a man takes the head off a
pot of porter, and says, I should like to cut off
the heads of kings, should I not know what
the context was? must I not know what kings
they were speaking of, whether speaking of
those kings which he might think allied toe
gether for a purpose destructive to the princi-
ples of justice end humanity, or whether he
meant any thing that could lead even to an
idea of the king of Great-Britain ?

But supposing any men connected in a
scheme tor the reform of parliament; I wil]
suppose it in the case of honourable men, wha
meet in a society (of which I am a member)
for the purpose of a reform of parliament, for
any thing I know, if the papers of that society
were laid before your lordships, there might
be found expressions in them which y
lordships might think intemperate, expressions
which you might think illegal—expressions
which vou might think ought not to be used ;
and as far as your lordships could impute any
of these expressions to me, if they could be
tairly imputed, that would be one thing:—
but, good God! what man could ever enter
himself into any society for any one obj
whatever, if the language and if the writings

of every individual composing that society.
could be given in evidence against him.

I woul only ask where this is ta stop;
because I have a right to say, if Mr. Martin is
to be considered to be the decypherer of the
mind of Mr. Hardy, then J must enter into a
defence of the mind of Mr. Martin: I must
call witnesses to Mr. Martin’s character; for,
if there is any objection to that, [ have taken
the pains in preparing for this momentous
trial, to look from the earliest period of our
history down to the present hour, through all
the questions that have been put to witnesses
with regard to the declaration of their senti-
roents of persons accused, for the purpose of
their exculpation. Can you go the length of
making a declaration of Mr. Martin’s con-
temptuous behaviour towards the king evi-
dence not only to show that he thought lightly
ofthe king, but that every other man did, who
met for anuther purpose, and for another end?

Is it meant to be gravely said here, that if
persons meet together for the accomplishment
of a purpose, which purpose appears by the
evidence to be what I have no right to say,
because until your lordships and the jury
decide, whether it is to obtain a fair represen-
tation of the people in parliament by constitu-
tional means, or whether it is any thing else,
what quality the law shall annex to it, is
matter [ will not break in upon, for various
Teasons, at this moment. As the prisoner
stands accused of compassing the death of the
king, every thing he has done himself, every
thing done in his presence, every thing said
in his presence, to which he may be supposed
to assent, by continuing to meet the same

ns again, is to be received in evidence.

ow, for instance, if Mr. Martin had said this
in the presence of Mr. Hardy, and afterwards
he is found living with Mr. Hardy, it might
be said so far Hardy might be considered as
approving the conduct of Mr. Martin. I
understand this to be a letter found; I do not
know where, for that,is not even stated. ——

Mr. Garrow.—It is a letter addressed to
Margarot, at Edinburgh, he being a mis-
Sionary from this society.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre——Where was it
found ? what is the fact?

Br. White.—It was not found among his

yers, but we shall prove it to be Martin’s

nd-writing.

Mr. Erskine.—Suppose, instead of being a
letter to Margarot, it had been a letter to
Hardy himself, it would not be evidence; I
cannot help a man’s writing a letter to me—
the post may bring it, and it may be found in
my custody; if any man were to write a letter
to me by the post, containing matters I highly
disapproved, your lordships could not crimi-
nate me because this letter was found in my
custody.

I wish this to be considercd, in order for

our lordships to see the extent to which this
ineiness isopened. Weare now faradvanced
ip the second day, upon an indictment for


compassing the death of the king; and, if |
your lordships look through the State Trials,
from the beginning of our history to the
present time, you will find what has been
remarked by the Court, that it has never been
necessary to have recourse to the expedients
employcd last night, by the indulgence of the,
Court, in a case of high treason. In the
case of Elizabeth Canning, I understand it
was done. But, if this ficld of evidence is to
be gone into, I protest I cannot see when this
willend, because I am sure that your lord,
wae will do impartial justice, and, therefore,
if this letter of Mr. Martin’s is to be read,
Mr. Martin, of course, must be allowed to
explain it. If the crown can give the letter
in evidence, because Mr. Martin happened to
be a member of the London Corresponding
Society, every man’s letters, who was a mem-
ber of any of these societies, which were in
correspondence together (for your lordship
will recollect, that the conspirators, if there
are any, are all who have been moving to
this purpose by affiliated societies), their
bureaus might be broken open, their letters
intercepted at the post-office, or he seized
upon by the magistracy, and your lord
ship might have to read the correspondence of
every man in these societies ; I wish to know
that, because it may be material, and 1 may
withdraw my objection. Shall I, in my turn,
be allowed to produce the letters of all the
members of these societies to their friends?
Certainly not; it would be absurd and foolish
to expect it: therefore, upon every principle
of law, I object to this letter of Mr. Martin’s
being read, unless it can be shown that his
letter is connected with something that Mr.
Hardy and he have done together, and that it
can be brought home to Mr. Hardy, that he
knew the facts contained in that Neier, and
that it was something done in the furtherance
and accomplishment of a conspiracy between
them, I certainly must object to any improper
expressions in this letter being imputed to
Mr. Hardy—I object to its being given in
evidence.

Mr. Gibbs.—After this point has been so
ably argued by Mr, Erskine, I can add but
very little; but this I must say, that it seems
to be offering this letter with an endeavour to
bring: befure your lordships precisely the same
question again, If I touk what your lordship .
said accurately, when the decision was given
upon the last point, and that evidence was
rejected, your lordship said, that in Dam-
maree’s case, and in lord George Gordon’s
case, it was true, that the declarations of
persons when the prisoners were not present
were received in evidence; but they were re-
ceived for this reason, because they had becn
present at the collection of the mob, and,
during the riots of those mobs, in the trans-
actions of which it was endeavoured to im-
plicate the prisoners :—what they declared
while they were in action, was admissible
evidence, to show what the object of these

insurrections was, and therefore it was re+
ceived: but your lordships have never deter-
mined, tbat that which was declared by a per-
gon unconnected with the prisoner at the bar,
except as he may, at particular occasions,
have been brought into his company, could in
any case be received as evidence.

i understand the line to be this: when a
fman is indicted for that which is done by a
great collection of men assembled together,
and he is present at some times and absent at
others, the declarations of other men acting
with him in that very act for which he is in-
dicted, are admissible evidence to show what
the object of that assembly was: But why was
the letter last offered, rejected? For this
reason, because it contained a relation of facts,
of which relation of facts the prisoner was not
cognizant: he did not know that these facts
were so related: What is the present letter?
I asked to see it before I addressed your lord-
ships: I was told I must not sec it, that it was
irregular; from what I have collected of it, it
is no more than the last letter: it contains a
relation of facts, and then they would add
to it, that the object of this relation of facts,
was to keep up the spirits of a person at Edin-
burgh; if { understood the argument, that
was the drift of it.

_ Mr. Garrow.—It was stated to be an excita-
Yon in terms.

Mr. Gibbs.—Certainly ; I am arguing under
great difficulties; my object was, to show

at this is the same question which your

Jordships have decided upon the former argu-
ment; I desired to see the letter before I
addressed my argument to your lordships,
which may certainly be all mere air, if I am
mistaken in the fact; I was told in point of
regularity, I could not sce the letter, and
therefore I can only argue it upon the recol-
iection of what was loosely stated: it might
be sc intended, in the mind of the writer of
it, to keep up the spirits of Mr, Margarot :
But was that object communicated to the
prisoner? Did he mean that those facts
should be so related? The real object for
producing this letter, is this—that the repre-
sentation of facts contained in that letter, b
the writer of it (and in the writing of which
fetter the prisoner is not in any respect impli-
cated), that the narration of facts by the
writer of the letter, should be fixed upon the
peisoners that whatever the writer of that
letter has improvidently, foolishly, rashly, or
I will say unlawfully expressed in that letter
that rashness, folly, or illegality, may be fixed
upon Mr. Hardy. It seems to me, that this
case comes directly within the spirit of your
lordships decision upon the last argument.

Cases were stated upon the last argument,
in which the declarations of third persons
were received against a prisoner; but it was
only in cases where the prisoner was indicted
for joining in the act of a multitude, where
persons are sometimes present and sometimes

abpent; a part of that multitude, at the time


they were unlawfully collected, for which
unlawful collection the prisoner was among
others indicted; part of them had deel
what was their object. I agree that may be
evidence against a prisoner, and he must
exculpate himself if he can; but that a letter
shauld be evidence against Mr. Hardy, which
he never saw, and for a purpose to which he
never acceded, seems to me against all law,
and I am sure that it is against all justice ;
for the object of this indictment is to try the
mind of Mr. Hardy—to try whether he did in
his mind compass the death of the king.
And surely, justice docs not require that that
which is proved to pass in the mind of one
man ahauld fix a similarity of sentiment in
the mind of another, who neither directed the
letter to be written which is offered in evi-
dence, nor ever afterwards knew that the
letter was written, which letter too never was
received.

Mr. Solicitor General.—I will trouble your
lordship with a very few words upon this
point, and, I trust, your lordship will be of
opinion that it is unquestionably evidence.
Certain persons are indicted for endeavouring
to procure a Convention to be assembled to
subvert the legislature, rule and government,
now duly ani happily established in this
kingdom, and other overt-acts of the same
tendency. Now upon the very Eencivs
which has been just stated by Mr. Gibbs, it
appears to me that this is evidence. The
principle which is stated by Mr. Gibbs is, that
that,which is declared by conspirators, whilst
in action, is evidence against those who were
not presentat the time, as well as against those
who were present at the time———.

Mr. Gibbs.—I beg your pardon, I would
not have you take my argument improperly ;
I did not say conspirators in action, but I
said that where a number of men are indicted
for acts of violence in which they unite, and
the prisoner is sometimes present and some-
times absent, that what is stated by some of
those persons who are said to co-operate with
him in some of those acts of violence may be
evidence.

Mr. Solicitor General.—I am very - litle
capable of distingutahing between what {
stated and what Mr. Gibbs now says. I take
this to be a declaration of conspirators in the
progress of their conspiracy, and I take that
to be exactly the distinction between this
case, and that which your lordships have
determined, with respect to which it is my
duty to submit to the judgment of the Court.
That was a letter addresscd to a person,
whom we have not shown to be, in any
degree, involved in the conspiracy, to a Mr.
Vellam; whereas this is a letter, addressed
by Mr. Martin, who is proved to be chairman
of the meeting on the 20th of January, to
Maurice Margarot, who was the deputy froty
the Corresponding Society, at the Convention
which was held at Edinburgh; itis, therefore,
a conversation, by letter, between two persons

who were parties to the conspiracy, if there
existed any conspiracy ; for, in all these cases,
the first question your lordships and the jury
will have to consider, is the existence of a
conspiracy, and the object of that conspiracy ;
and then, whether the person charged was
party to that conspiracy. .

Now for the purpose of showing the exist-
ence of a conspiracy, and for the purpose of
showing what the views of the conspirators
were, bow far they went, conversations of
those conspirators totally distinct from the
prisoner, have constantly been admitted to be

iven in evidence. In the case of my lord
Stafford, which was a prosecution, by impeach-
ment in parliament, for high treason, in com-
passing the death of the king, and proceeding
to great length; the evidence that was first
given was simply, and only of the general
plot,* by persons who were capable, as they
afterwards proved by their testimony, of
bringing that treason specifically home to
lord Stafford; they were not examined to
that point at first, but were examined simply,
and only to the general plot; one thing which
may proved in the course of that evidence,
with respect to the general plot, I will
state to your lordships; it was a discourse
between Anderton, Campion, Green, and
several other persons, with which lord Staf-
ford had no sort of connexion whatever, in
which those persons told the witness, that
there would be a great alteration in England
ere long; that the king was an heretic, and
might be destroyed; that they industriously
preached this doctrine, and that the duke
of York was with them. Evidence was

iven of these conversations. Who were

e persons that held these conversations?
They were not persons included in the im-
peachment of lord Stafford, but persons to
whom it was imputed that they were in the
common and general conspiracy, which was
cbarged to exist, for .the purpose of the
restoration of the Roman Catholic religion
in this country, and for the purpose of
deposing the king, and subverting the go-
vernment of the country. The manner in
which serjeant Maynard states the evidence
which was to be given, seems to me to be
perfectly clear. He says, “ This is a treason
of a faction, and of a general party in the
nation : it is not this or that lord, but a great
pumber; itis not this or that lord that is
mentioned in the articles, but the con-
ee is of a great faction. This do we

ink, and this makes us so earnest to press
the general before your lordships, that we
may give satisfaction to your lordships, and
the world, what this plot hath been, and how
carried on every where.

My lords, the consequence of that is very

t; for, my lords, if there were a general
lesign, and a general plot, as clearly there



was, some were to act in Spain, and some in
France; some in other places; some in Ire-
land, Scotland, and England, and a great
number of jesuits (we have a matter of hiny
in chase about this business)=I say, my lords,
if it be so, if one action be in one place, and
another in another, yet if there be a common
consent to accomplish this plot, then what
the one dves is the act of all, and the act of
all is the act of every one.

“ My lords, the persons were many, and
the places and times many they acted in, and
the designs which they were to accomplish
and the means wherewith they were to
accomplish them were many tou.”®

My lords, in the case of lord Lovat, the
same sort of doctrine is laid-down with
respect to the evidence.—The solicitor-ge-
neral of that time says, “It is necessary,
therefore, by general evidence, to show
that there have been such plots and conspi-
racies as the Commons assert, and then to
affect the noble lord at the bar, by proper
evidence, with being concerned in these plots.”
It was so, he says, in lord Stafford’s case, and
at the “ trials at law of the persons accused
of having been in the same plot. The same
method was allowed as proper, and liable to
no just objection, in many trials after the
revolution.”+

This was said upon an objection that was
taken to the evidence of Mr. Murray, of
Broughton.—Mr. Murray proceeded in his
relation of the conspiracy; and one part of
the evidence which Re then gave was, that
lord Traquair had informed him, that a Mr.
Drummond had carried over to Paris a memo-
rial, and a list of all the gentlemen in Scot-
land, who would support the Pretender; that
he had conversed with Drummond; that
Drummond was then in Edinburgh, and pro-

sed that he should have a meeting with

im ; tbat he had a meeting with Drummon
who repeated much the same thing, and sai
he had been extremely well received by the
cardinal; that is cardinal Fleury.—Several
other parts of his evidence were to the same
tendency.—What was this but giving evidence
of conversations between twoconspiratorsupon
thesubject of the plot, for the purpose of show-
ing what was the nature, tendency, and ob-
jects of the plot, and what were the views of
the several persons who were concerned in it?

With submission to your lordships, this
letter is evidence upon the same ground.—It
is evidence, yuo animo, Mr. Martin acted.—.
I do not mean to say, it is direct evidence,
quo animo, Mr. Wardy acted, but it is the na-
ture of all plots that this sort of evidence
should be given; several persons are con-
cerned; they are brought into one engage-




ment; some of them may certainly have
views less culpable than others, but still, for
the purpose of a jury determining what is the
guilt of the particular person charged, the
views, the imtentions, declared by conversa-
tion, as well as otherwise, ofthe several per-
sons concerned in the plot, and especially
when it happens to be conversations between
two of the persons concerned in the plot,
which, with submission, a letter from one of
the persons engaged in it, to another of those
persons is, then I submit, that it is a matter
which may fairly and properly be given in evi-
dence, consistent with the determination
your lordships have made, and upon the very
foundation, that it is what passes between
persons engaged in a conspiracy, while the
conspiracy is in its process towards that con-
clusion, which we submit the conspirators
had in view.

* Mr. Serjeant Adair.—It is not on account
Of the importance of this particular piece of
evidence that I take the liberty of addressing
a very few words to your lordships, upon the
subject of the objection that has bcen made,
but from an impression of the very great im-
portance of the principle upon which this ob-
Jection may be decided, and the extensive ap-
plication of it to other cases that may in
future occur,

In order to understand the objection, it is
necessary to state the ground upon which this
evidence is offered: and I conceive that a

reat part of the argument of my learned

iend, who very ingeniously stated this ob-
jection at first, is answered by a cunsidera-
tion of the ground upon which this evidence
is offered ; for I do not conceive, and I, for
one, do not offer the evidence to the Court
upon the ground, that the idle expressions of

Mr. Martin respecting the king,—that the
relation of an accidental fact that happened
im the Park, within Mr, Martin's knowledge,
respecting the king, is any evidence at all
against the prisoner; but it is upon this
ground, that a part of that letter which we
offer in evidence is alleged to relate, and your
lordships, when it is read, will find that it does
relate to an act done by the conspirators, as
itis contended, in the furtherance and pro-
secution of that conspiracy which is by the in-
dictment imputed to the prisoner.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre —Be so good as
state a little more particularly what that is.

Mr. Serjeant Aduir.—It is a statement from
one of the conspirators, who had been in the
chair at the meeting of those whom we call
the conspirators, held, as it has been alleged,
for the purpose of furthering the views of that
conspiracy—it is a statement of that conspi-
rator to another person, alleged to be a con-
spirator, of what fees at that mecting, so
held.— Now the charge against the prisoner is
the compassing the king’s death, by means of
a conspiracy, to overturn the constituted au-
thorities of the state, and the government of
the country, under. colour of a professed de-


sign only to make a reform in parliamentary
representation, and to correct abuses in one’
branch of the legislature ;—a design which,
pursued by innocent and proper means, might
possibly be either wholly innocent, oramount
to a guilt infinitely less than that which
is charged by this indictment; but when such
a conspiracy as is imputed to the prisoner, is
alleged to be carried on under colour of such
a pretext, many of the acts of those conspira-
tors must, in their nature, be equivocal, and
admit of different constructions.—How are
these constructions to be colected,—how is
that ambiguity to be removed,—but by views
of the conduct and declarations of the persons
alleged to be in the conspiracy itself !—It is
upon that ground, and that alune, that this is
submitted to the Court as the statement of
the proceedings at a meeting, by one conspi-
rator to another conspirator, implicated in the
general design, but not present at that meet-
ing.—It seems to me, that there is no kind of
evidence that can tend more directly to deve-
lope the real intention of the parties in the
transaction, than that species of evidence
which is now offered.—I do not mean to con-
tend, that the letter, when read, which I have
cast my eye over, will itself go any great
length in effectuating that purpose, but the
nature of the evidence is such as may be im-
portant, fee s, in other instances, much
more so than the present; and the principle
is extensive in its application, not only to the
trials upon the present occasion, but those that
may hereafter occur in this country, and at
times when this trial may become a prece-
dent to posterity.

The grounds upon which this evidence ig
offered to the Court, seem to me to fall di-
rectly within the principle of lord Stafford’s
case; but, even f it eould be distinguished
from other cases, I think it cannot be distin-
guished from the cases of Dammaree and lord

3eorge Gordon ; and the distinction that has
been attempted between an act of violence, or
any other act, in furtherance ofa conspiracy, FE
confess I do not feel much the force of. —
This comes so completely within the princi-
ple of lord George Gordon's case, that it is
impossible, without holding that case net to be
law, to reject this evidence.

Your lordships will pardon me for having
made these observations ; it was merely from
the importance of the principle, and not
from the least idea that the letter, when read,
will be thought to be very much in itself.

Mr. Bearcroft.—1 make no apology for
troubling your lordships with a few observa-
tions upon this point; it is a case of ve
great imjortance; and when I say that, I am
sure I shall be understood, that I do not stand
up to speak of the importance of it, because I
am likely to give any extraordinary assistance,
but, inasmuch as it is of so great and ge-
neral importance, I, therefore, feel it m:
duty to attempt to do it in the best way
can.—I shall, in doing it, avoid two things 3

¥ will not attempt to break into, or con-
trovert, the rule that has been already laid
down by the Court, as I understand it—I
will not repeat a syllable that has been said b
the learned gentleman before me—but I thin:
I can add another observation upon this
letter, which would entitle it to be read.

When I say I will not controvert the rule
Jaid down, as I understand it, I wish to state,
in order that I may be corrected if I misunder-
stand it, how I suppose it to have been laid
down,—as I understand it, it was decided, by
the authority of the Court, that a mere nar-
ration of simple facts that have passed is not
admissible evidence——I think that cannot
well be disputed ; my humble judgment cer-
tainly goes with that decision, if it is carried
no farther ;—but when a question of evidence,
and of great extent and iniportance, is befure
the Court, I have been always taught, that
the way to decide upon the competency and
admissibility of that evidence is to consider,—
What is the question trying ?—Against whom
is the testimony offered ?—What is the na-
ture of it?—To what purpose is it adduced?

Now I understand, or I am grossly mistaken
in the whole of this proceeding, that the ob-
ject of it is to show, that the prisoner at the

aris guilty of high treason, of the species
charged | in this indictment, by the means,
-and by overt acts, which amount to a conspi-
racy, with many others, to carry that trea-
sonable intent into execution; that is the na-
ture of the charge.—The consequence I con-
ceive most clearly to be this, that though it is
an indictment for high treason, yet, because
that high treason is to be carried into execu-
tion by the means ofa conspiracy, that all the
evidence ‘which will, by law, be admissible
upon the trial of a minor conspiracy, a con-
spiracy not treasonable, will be admissible
likewise upon the present inquiry.

Now, my lords, I take it to be a settled rule
in the trial of an indictment for a conspiracy
of every kind, that when once you have es-
tablished, that the prisoner at the bar has
conspired together with others, not then upon
trial, in the indictment—nay I go farther,
not charged in the indictment :—When I sa:
established, Ido not mean established deci-
dedly, that they are guilty of the conspiracy,
but that there is evidence admissible, and
‘to be laid before the jury, upon which they are
to exercise their judgment—then I have a
right to give in evidence the acts of others, so
connected.

My lord, it cannot he disputed, that some
evidence to prove the conspiracy is in the pos-
session of the Court; nay, it is in the pos-
session of the jury; for it cannot be in
possession of the Court, without being in
possession of the jury; they have heard it, of ;
course, as it has been admitted.—We have
got thus far, that the prisoner at the bar was |
engaged in a conspiracy, together with Mar-
tin and Margarot—they two corresponded by ,
letter—they two conversed, in writing, as has '


| much of the purport as is necessar:


been rightty stated by Mr. Solicitor General.

What is the object of the conspiracy ?—We
contend it is to overturn the government, and
depose the king, whereby it isobvious, to any
common understanding, that the life of the
king is in danger.—Now I contend, therefore,
with the utmost deference to the Court, that
this letter is competent evidence—no matter
how far it extends, or how short it goes—if it
goes any step atall; but I confess that I feel,
and I am sanguine enough to state, that:
goes pointedly, importantly, and directly to
the matter of high treason charged in the in-
dictment.—I said I would not repeat a sylla-
ble that had been urged by the gentlemen be-
fore me, but I desire to be understood, that
my mind goes with them entirely, and accedes
to every part of their arguments.

I beg leave to advert to another part of this
letter, that, I say, goes pointedly to show,
that the design was for compassing the mis-
chievous, the traitorous,—I had very nearly
said the personal destruction of the king.
What I advert to in this letter, I will read te

our lordships in the very words :—“ The

‘ing went yesterday to meet Ais parliament.”
Your lordships will mark the expression; it is
very decent, but—

Mr. Erskine.—I must beg to interrupt my
learned friend ; I beg his pardon ; that part
of the letter has been, within these three mi-
nutes, expressly given up by Mr. Serjeant
Adair, as counsel for the crown, who finished
what he had to say before my friend got up,
by saying, that that part of the letter which
my friend now chooses to read aloud, in the
hearing of the jury, he did not mean to con-
tend to be evidence against the prisoner—and,
therefore, if the letter comes to be read, the
letter will be read with the omission of that
part; or if the omission did not take place,
that part is admitted by Mr. Serjeant Adair,
not to be evidence against the prisoner.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—The interruption
is not quite proper : because, if it were so, that
my brother Adair had distinctly admitted it in
that manner, yet that could not conclude the
argument of another learned gentleman, if
he was of opinion he could maintain it.

Mr. Erskine.—Does your lordship think,
that it is consistent with the rules which must

; bind us upon this occasion, that, in arguing
‘the admissibility of a piece of evidence, they

are not merely to state to the Court the
general nature of it, so that the Court may
ive its decision before a thing, which, per-
aps, is not afterwards to be received in evi«
dence, should make any thing like an impres-
sion, but to read the paper itself.
Lord Chief Justice Eyre—No; only so
'y to inform
the Court of the nature of it. :
Mr. Erskine.—My friend is not merely
reading the lettcr, in that part which one of
the counsel, at least, admitted not to be evi-
dence, but he is commenting upon it, step by
stcp.—I apprehend my friend may state, that
2H

there is an expression personally reflectin,

upon the king ; but, in order to argue the ad-
missibility of any piece of evidence, it is not
to be reall by the counsel for the crown inthe
hearing of the jury; because if, after the
counsel has read it, in the hearing of the
jury, the Court say it is not admissible
evidence against the prisoner, it may lead
to affect the prisoner, because it may affect
the minds of the jury, in a manner inconsis-
tent with the nature of the testimony re-
ceived on the trial. lam now, I understand,
in possession of your lordships judgment upon
this point.

Mr. Serjeant Adair.—As my friend has
done me the honour to advert more to what
fell from me than the weight of it seemed to
deserve, I heg leave to state and explain what
I did say upon the subject. I did state, and
I do not mean to retract it, that the part of
the letter which I alluded to, when 1 spoke,
was not the ground upon which we offered it
to P ha lordships, and would not, of itself,
Make that evidence against the prisoner;
but I did never state, that if there was that in
the letter, upon the ground of which I con-
tended it was proper evidence, as applicable
evidence to the charge against the prisoner,
that the whole context of that letter should
not be taken together, in order to show the
intention of the parties who are implicated in
that design. I have never admitted that.
But his lordship has certainly truly said, that
my admission does not preclude any other
gentleman arguing upon that ground. I
wished to repeat what it was that I did state,
that I might not be accused of having admit-
ted that which I never admitted.

Mr. Bearcroft.—I have received this inter-
ruption with the greatest patience, because it
is made by a counsel for a man now trying for
his life; if it had been made in any other
place, and ina civil cause, I could not have
orborne instantly to express my astonishment
at the gross irregularity of the interruption ;
because I conceive it is not only the privilege,
but it is absolutely the duty of a counsel,
when he is arguing upon the admissibility of
evidence, to state that evidence to the Court.
If, it can, by any other means, be argued, my
learned friend will be so good as tell me
how that is to be performed, for I really cane
not conceive.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre —The counsel is to
open the nature of the evidence.

Mr. Erskine.—I am in possession of the
judgment of the Court on that which Mr,
Bearcroft calls an interruption.

Mr. Bearcroft.—I am certainly aware, that
it may be done in that shape of opening the
nature of the evidence; but with great sub-
mission to the Court, I conceive that was pre-
cisely what I was going to do. I do conceive,
with great deference, that it would be ex-
tremely improper in me to be reading the
evidence, from the beginning to the end,
under colour that that should be necessary to


argue as to the admissibility of it. I de
adanit, that it is sufficient; nay, that more
ought not to be done than to state the nature
of it; but I conceive that the nature of that
part of it, which I point out as one of the
main grounds of the admissibility of this let-
ter, are certain particular expressions made
use of in it. What strikes me, at this mo-
ment, is [contained in two lines and a half :—
“ Nay, I am told a woman, moved and seduced
by the instigation of the devil, and traitorously
intending, &c. did, in St. James’s- park, take
off her patten, and threw it, with all her
force, whereby the glass of the state coach
was broken, and his majesty put in fear.
God save the king; for, if, &c. as Gerrald
says,”— Be acl

y do submit to the Court, that this is impor-
tant evidence to the very point of the indict-
ment; namely, for the pu se of showing a
mischievous intention to the king. Because
this is a letter from one of the conspirators to
another of the conspirators, exulting in the
transaction, enjoying it, and stating it as good
news, for his purpose, to his brother conspi-
rator. That is the light, with great submis-
sion, in which it strikes me. I conceive that
that is an additional ground upon which this
letter is admissible.

Mr. Bower.—I should be ashamed to trou-
ble the court with a word Ls this objection,
for the sake of the piece of evidence that is
now in my hand, because it does not appear,
of itself, to be of so much importance as to
demand so much attention ; but it will be of
very considerable consequence in the course
of these trials, if a piece of evidence, offered
to the court under the circumstances in which
we offer this letter, should not be considered,as
good evidence.

I will attend to what your lordship su
gested, that the duty of counsel is to open the
tendency of the evidence, at the time it is
offered and objected to; and, with great
deference to my friends who have gone be-
fore me, I do not think that they have opened
the tendency of that part of this letter, which
appears to me to be material, and to be an
indisputable ground why it should be received
in evidence.

I must beg your lordships to advert to the
state of the present cause. We have already
proved, as against the pooner, a paper,
signed with the name of John Martin, as
chairman, at a meeting of the society of which
he himself is secretary. This paper was
brought home to him by evidence, and by
‘etnch, he, therefore, admits, that Martin was
the chairman of that meeting; the date of the
letter, which I hold in my hand, is the 22d of
January, 1794; it is subsequent to the period
of that convention in Scotland, of which we
have heard so much, and it is relative to that
convention. ‘The letter which I want to read
now is from Mr. Martin, who we have proved
to be so connected with Mr. Hardy, to their
delegate in Scotland, who was at that time, in

consequence of the interposition of the civil
magistrate, in confinement, as it appears, to en-
courage him to proceed in these efforts, which
he was sent there to attempt, by telling him
that subscriptions will now be raised, which
‘will be an assistance to him, and by informing
hiim that it may be thought advisable to
have another meeting here, in a commodious
place, for the purpose of carryin into effect
the views of the convention, which the magis-
tracy of that country interrupted. That is
the tendency of the greatest part of the letter,
which we now offer to the Court; and if we
have brought ourselves into the situation of
showing, as I trust we have, that Mr. Hardy
has admitted Mr. Martin to be chairman of
the Corresponding Society ; if we have proved
that the object of that society was to accom-
plish certain purposes; when I say we have
proved, I take it we have given evidence to
prove it; if we have proved, that the objects
of that society were, to carry certain purposes
into effect, by means of the convention ; if we
show incitement from a person proved to be
connected with the prisoner in the way Mar-
tin has been proved, to proceed in those steps
which are the objects of that convention, and
to persevere in those measures, which were
the measures used to bring about the ultimate
purposes of that convention, we may prove a
direct act, done in furtherance of that con-
spiracy, by showing a direct incitement, by a
Jetter in the very words of the overt act
charged in this indictment, to persevere, and
go on with that conduct, which was to lead
to the ultimate end that the society had in
view.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I understand
that this letter is not proved ever to have
come to the hands of Margarot; you call ita
letter; it is, in truth, merely a paper, in Mar-
tin’s hand-writing.

Mr. Bower.—The argument would, perhaps,
be stronger, if it had come to his hands ; but,
with great submission to your lordship, it is
evidence of the intent of this Mr. Martin to
encourage the party, who appears to have
been intended to have been addressed by this
letter, in the general purposes for which this
society has been established, and which they
were going to carry into effect; but it is not
so strong, to be sure, as if I could prove that
it arrived at Margarot’s possession, because, I
take it, that would put it out of all doubt; but
any letter, written from a conspirator in the
connexion we have proved Mr. Martin to be,

having proved him to be chairman of that |

very meeting, the object of this letter being

to persevere in these measures, and to forward
those purposes, which we have proved the
society had in view, and that Martin, the
man who writes this letter, particularly had
in view, by the transactions at the Globe
tavern, is not, I conceive, a recital of any
thing that has passed, but a direct incitement
to go on with that act, which we are about to

|


prove, as being the act intended by this
society to be carried into effect, by the joint
or individual efforts of the members of the
society. It does appear to me to be mate-
rial, that we should now know whether or no,
when we have established an intimate con-
nexion between Martin and the prisoner,
that an act done by Martin, in direct further-
ance and prosecution of the main design,
should not be admitted as evidence against
the prisoner, though we have given evidence,
that they were connected in the individual
and particular act which is the subject of the
evidence that has been offered. I submit to
your lordships, that this is evidence which,
in this stage of the cause, ought to be re-
ceived; and it is not for the materiality of
this piece of evidence, but for the sake of the
principle that we wish to have established.

Mr. Law.—The ground upon which I meant
to address your lordships has been, ina great
degree, anticipated by what has fallen from Mr.

wer.—In considering whether any written
evidence, in general, is admissible, I will consi-
der, first, what is the relation between the party
who wrote this letter, the person to whom it
is written, aud the party to be affected by it,
—There has been evidence to prove, that
there existed in the members of this society,
a conspiracy to subvert the government; thea
I submit to your lordships, that, having laid
that ground, it isin the ordinary course of
proceeding to give evidence of the detached
acts of any one individual, conducing to the
general end and purpuse to be effected by the
general conspiracy.

Then what is this act? And is it an act:
which falls within any of the overt-acts
charged upon the face of the indictment?—
I think it is peculiarly applicable to that
overt-act which states that they composed
and wrote, and caused to be composed and
written, divers books, pamphlets, letters, &c.
containing incitements, encouragements, and
exhortations, for the purpose of accomplish-
ing this object of holding a convention, for
the purpose of deposing and ultimately pro-
curing the death of his majesty. Now is
this letter in furtherance of that object? it
contains the common incitementsand exhorta-
tions of this sort; it encourages him to per-
severe, and states as a ground why he should
persevere, that the toms of the society were
Increasing ; that their numbers were increas-
ing; and that their prospect of success was
increasing. That being stated (for 1am not
at liberty to detail the particular contents of

| the letter), as the subject and object of the
to excite the person to whom it was written, ,

letter: the only question is, whether such a
letter as that, of which it may be predicated,
that it contains an exhortation and incitement
to this object, is or not to be received in evi+
dence. I conceive there can be no doubt it
is an excitement and exhortation upon this
subject, and if it be that it is ad«issible.

Mr. Erskine.—My lord, unless I mistake
the cause, and the stage we are now arrived

at in it, this is novel. I think I may call ita
phenomenon in the history of trials for high
treason, and in the practice of a court of
justice. My lord, standing here towards the
middle of the second day, I must appeal to
the honour of the Court, and to the candour
of the bar, whether we who are of counsel for
the prisoner have not been extremely ready,—
perhaps, readier than we might altogether jus-
tify to our client in a capital case,—in permit-
ting the reception of evidence, having troubled
your lordships with no arguments, having
asked hardly a single question of any witness
that has been sworn. I am persuaded, when
your lordships recollect the course that this
cause has taken, that you cannot but see that
we should have made no sort of objection to
the reading of this letter, had it contained
nothing more than my learned friend Mr.
Garrow very decently, in my opinion, and
very properly stated to the Court, considering
and properly considering, that though the
Court might be involved in the difficulty in
reading a part of a letter, which part could
in no instance be evidence against the pri-
soner, yet that the technicality of the evidence
might unfortunately call upon your lordships
to direct a jury to do that which a judge
cannot direct a jury to do, because human
nature will not permit the accomplishment of
it—to discharge from their minds the recol-
Jection of what they have heard. My friend
did, therefore, properly not even open the
generality of that part of the letter; but what
have I in this cause to do with any thing that
Mr. Martin might write, and which may
appear for any thing I know to be an unpub-
lished letter in Mr. Martin’s
therefore upon no principle of Jaw to be evi-
dence at all. I conceived that we were
debating it as far as related to the prosecution
of what was called a plot and conspiracy ;
namely, that which was published in all the
newspapers, and which your lordships have
been engaged two daysin hearing read. [must
be a fool to stand here and object to reading
a paper which contains nothing more than
what the jury have been employed two days
of their precious time in hearing; but so it
went on, and at last Mr. Serjeant Adair said,
that, which ifit had been said at first, I would
have waved my objection, and the jury should
have heard the letter, and that part would
have been crossed out, or the officer would
have been desired not to read it; and I defy
any man of common sense to say he could
suppose I should object to it. Do not let any
_ Man explain away that which I did say, and

that which the honourable and learned serjeant
stated, with the sense that belongs to him,
and the humanity which, I trust, will ever
accompany that sense. He stated that he
did not mean to insist upon the jury hearing
those lines read: he thought they ought not
to hear ahem.

Then cames the next learned counsel, and
he makes pot a single observation upon apy

ossession, and |


other part of the letter which is stated to he.
in furtherance of that which is called the
conspiracy; but he fastens upon that, and
proposes to read that which the counsel whe
went before him admitted was mo evidence
against my client. I stood up to object, not
to interrupt. I stand here to object when-
ever there is a legal objection open tome. I
had your lordships j ent for the founda-
tion of my objection; but my friend paid no
regard to your lordships judgment: after
I was possessed of your lordships _iudement;
he went on and read the very words aguinst
the reading of which I objected; and having
done so, he kindly tells me that as J am coun-
sel in a criminal case, he receives my inter-
ruption with a gentleness with which he
would not receive such an interruption in a
civil cause. He says this after he has dane
that which is illegal, and has not been stop-
ped in the doing it, though I objected to rt,
and was in possession of the judgment of the
a 4 i

My lords, this is no trifling matter, gi
me leave to say, 1 stand here for the ike of
an innocent man; and I stand here fur the
law and constitution of England, and I wild
suffer nothing to be done while I stand bers
that is not consonant to both. Then where
are we got to now in the debate? We ape
got to that which fills me with alarm and ap~
prehension ; it is an object of 2 magnitude so
great, so mighty, and what I am so unaccus-
tomed to consider, that I hardly know how to
grapple with it, or how to address myself to
your lardships.

ttis truly stated too by the learned serjeant
that what the crown profess lo make eut by
the evidence they haye been offering a0 your
lordships for a great season is, that Mr.
was engaged ina conspiracy. Why is that
unfortunate man at the bar to be the only
victim of a conspiracy? I do not mean the
only one; there are eight or ten indicted with
him. How many thousands of his majesty’s
subjects are meant to be hrought to this place
I cannot tell; fer the conspiracy that is .al-
leged goes to the members of every ene of
the societies. I say, in my judgment, epom

| the evidence that is before the Court,

man who has been a member of these Comes~
ponding Societies; who has been a member
of this Constitutional Society; every man
who has been connected with those acts, if
the acts constitute a conspiracy to subvert the
government, is liable to be put into the same
Situation with Mr. Hardy; and any thing thas
is written by any one person belonging to
either of these societies would be eq avi-
dence against him.

The whole distinction seems to be this,
and that distinction seems misunderstued. £
agree with Mr. Solicitor General in what be
said, with regard to lord Stafford’s case,
founding itself as far as relates to acts. Now
if this had been within the scope of the busi-
ness under examination, an act done by Mar-

garot and by Martin, i shall admit thet such
act done would be evidence against the pri-
soner; but I am abjecting to a letter, more
especially a letter that never found its way to
the person to whom it was written; that it
was ever intended for Mr. Margarot, as far
as the evidence goes, we do not know; but
by the contents of which letter we are suught
to be affected.

Noy there is only ene thing I am anxious
about. I wish to submit it to the justice and
to the discretion of this Court. Suppose part
of this letter is evidence, and part of it is aot
on ae that part which is mot evidence to

2

_It happens every day that four lodships
direct part of an answer to ax interrogatory to
be in a court of equity; but you will act
allow other parts to be readl, because they are
not admissible evidence. Now all that I ob,
ject to is, the reading this account of an old
woman throwing her pattea at she king’s
coach ; it is something 0 perfectly ridiculous ;

aman’s writing such a trurppery eneodote
as that, should affect a man trying for his life
in such a case as this, it would be an imault to
suppose; but at the same time it . 3 te
me to be a dangerous precedent, to allow aay
thing to be read as evidence which has no
connexion with the éransaction before ithe
Court, but is » mere fippancy, which she
writer of a Ietter happens to put into it;
which letter has in it matter that may became
evidence.

Aord Chief Justice Eyre—This
has e into a length of discussion ;
but [ blame nobody, as there was some differ-
enoe of opinion in the Court upoa the former
occasion ; therefore it required that this ques-
tion should be more fully discussed.

I agree with Mr. Bearcroft, that he has
stated truly what the nature of this questian
is; namely, that if this were merely a trial
for a conspiracy, this would be evidence
against one of the parties in that conspiracy,
because the question, whether this prisoner is
to be reached upon the apecific charge against
him, is, undoubtedly, a question, whether he
is to be reached -by that medium; aad if the
medium is once established, that question
arises, upon which I will say no more at pre-

sant.

- It is perfectly clear that in the case of a
Conspiracy, the general evidence of she thing
canspired is given in evidence, and then the
party who is at present brought before @ court
of justice to answer for it is to be affected for
his shase in it; the question then is, whether
@ paper under the hand of @ person, who is
proved to be one of the conspirators, shall be
Teceived in evidence, where it ts nothing more
ban a paper under his hand? For, as I take
Ht, as this case stands, it is not a letter sent to
Margarot. There is no preef that Margarot
nd recerve any such agen pe aia
it may be a paper merely writtem pri ly
Martin, who is the person im whose hapd-

question |

This is of the nature of confession, and


writing it is stated to be, and may never have
gone out of his hands. The question is, wher
ther under these circumstances such @ paper
is to be admitted in evidence, ina case in
which another person pow stands at the
bar; and, I confess, that this does not ap-
pear to me to be suffidently distinguished
from the case which we just now determined,
$o satisfy my mand that it ought to be received
in evidence.

It is undoubtedly true, that the general
plot is to be made out by proving the trans-
actions of others, to which the prisoner at the
bar may not be immediately a pers but
thea, bow is itto be proved? Is it to be
proved by the mere acknowledgment of theac
other parties, end so made use of against the
prisoner now at the bar? For instance, here
isa conspiracy charged. Sup; & witness
should come and say, J heard Thelwall sey
that he was engaged i auch a cons| :
and I heard Martin say he was engaged im
such a conspiracy ; end [ heard Margaret say
he was engaged io mich a conspiracy. My
present apprehension is, that that would be
extremely good evidence personally against
the parties, who said it to prove against them
individually, that they were cnncerned in that
conspiracy, but that it would be no evidence
whatever agaiast third persons, a8 was the
case on ford StaGord’s trial. A witness prav-
ed that he heard A. B. and C. converse upen
the subject ofa conspiracy; that is a direct
proof that ahese three persons conspired, and
there the conversation of que is evidence
against the ether, and so on; that is evidence
of a transaction, a fact, not hear-say evidence;
and not evidence of a party’s acknowledg-
ment, oaly inasmuch as it is an acknowledg.
ment by one in the presence of the others,
they acquiescing, and therefore becomes dis-
tinct and proper evidence. Sut I have ala
ways taken it that with regard to these persa-
nal acknowledgments of having meant to in.
citey—for that isthe nature of this letter—J
have always taken it that that was proper
evidence, if the party who was to be affected
by it happened to stand at the bar to answer
for it: but if another person was indicted by
himself, that there could be no evidence re-
ceived against that person, but the evideace
of facts proved by the witnesses, who peeve
the existence of the facts in regular evi-
dence: confessional evidence is ad hominem
only. Lfit happens that a matter of fact is
evidence against A, by evidence of the truth of
that fact, other thay the confession of A, that
does also become evidence against B, from
the circumstance of B being connected ée the
plot, and B being bound by al! that A has
done. But the course that has been observed
in the Stade Trials that I have read, bas been
that confessions have been made evidemes
against the individuals only who confessed.
Bow
thing more; that has been considered as evi.
dence only against the party, and is not te bo

received where that party is not the person
before the Court.

Lord Chief Baron Macdonald.—On the last
question before the Court I confined what I
said to the exact circumstance of the case,
namely, that the bare relation of acts by one
of several persons to whom the conspiracy is
imputed to a perfect stranger to that conspi-
racy, is no more than an admission which
may possibly affect himself, but cannot possi-
bly affect any of his co-conspirators, it not be-
ing an act done in the prosecution of that
conspiracy. But, I confess, there appears to
me a material distinction in this case. This
is a paper which is addressed by one of seve-
ral conspirators to another of those conspira-
tors; it is introduced as subservient to the
proof of the general nature and tendency of
that conspiracy, which is alleged and endea-
voured to be proved as the foundation of af-
fecting the prisoner with a share in that con-
Spiracy.

Now it seems to me that one conspirator
addressing a paper to another conspirator,
having relation to that conspiracy (not merely
a bare description to a stranger), that one of
them addressing that paper to the other is an
act complete in that single conspirator, al-
though that paper should be intercepted, or
although it never should reach that person
for whose perusal it was intended; that dis-
tinguishes this from the other case ; it is a
different act in one, though it does not reach
the other in that sense; it is an act by one
of the conspirators, which in order to show
the nature and tendency of that conspiracy
may be read as against any other.

Mr. Baron Hotham.—I remain of opinion
that in the last case, the letter then offered in
evidence ought not to have been suffered to
be read. That letter, however, I consider as
a very different letter from this; it was en-
closing some songs, supposed to have heen
sung at a meeting, sent to a totally indiffe-
rent person, and that was all that it contained.
This letter is written by a man who has been
proved to be the chairman of the meeting at
the Globe-tavern ; it is stated to be written
to, though not received by, Margarot, who
has been proved to be the delegate sent by
that meeting into Scotland ; and it is stated to
contain matters respecting his particular mis-
sion to Edinburgh. It 1s stated to contain
matters of incitement, and encouragement to
him to proceed in the cause in which he was
engaged ; namely, in the cause in which he
was engaged by the procurement, by the con-
sent, and by the direction of that meeting in

London; and that meeting in London has |

been proved to be composed of the prisoner
at the bar, of the writer of this letter, and his
correspondent to whom it was intended to be
sent, together with many others.

Now, therefdre, I do consider this as
strong evidence, to show that one of that
meeting so blended together as they are with
the prisoner, :e such a letter tending to


incite and encourage their own delegate to
proceed in the business, upon which they had
particularly sent him, and for which they had
especially commissioned him and empowered
him to act, ought to be admitted as evidence
to prove the sense of these conspirators, who
were also proved to have been together upon
that day.

Mr. Justice Buller—The case to which I
alluded just now was, that of William lord
Russell,* where my lord Howard, in his exa-
mination, goes very much at large into evi-
dence of what passed between him and lord
Shaftesbury; and in parts of that evidence he
goes on to say that he supposed these thin:
were told to lord Russell; that lord Russell
properly objects to: he says it ishearsay, and
does not affect him,+ but it is part of the evi-
dence which is given, and you find much re-
lied upon by the chief justicet in summing
up to the jury, with a view to that question
which I just now stated, as the first which
presses in point of order, and which question,
in my opinion, is always to be distinct from
the second question ; namely, whether it does
or does not immediately affect the prisoner.
The evidence given there by lord Howard is,
that in a conversation with lord Shaftesbury,
he asked him what forces he had, to which
lord Shaftesbury answered, that he had
enough, that ten thousand brisk boys were
gendy to follow him whenever he held up his

er.
hen this is summed 'up, the chief justice §
states it to the jury, repeating these words,
as evidence of a consult, but that it does not
affect lord Russell.

Then how stands the case here? The first
question to be made out is, that there was
some conspiracy to affect the life of the king;
—To make out that question you must go into
evidence of what was done by other persons.
When established, I agree that that would
not affect the prisoner, but it is necessary first
to show that here was such a conspiracy on
foot, and then you go on to the second ques-
tion, to see whether there is or is not evidence
to prove that this prisoner was acting a part in
that conspiracy. Now it seems to me that
the question will stand a little clearer, if we
suppose that a conspiracy of the nature con-
tended for on the part of the prosecution had
gone on without the intervention of such a
convention, as has been here proved, by per-
sons who were in the habit of committing
their resolutions to writing, if such a combi-
nation had existed, how in the nature of
things could it be made out, but by the decla-
rations and the conversations of those who
were parties toit? And it seems to me that
the way in which my brother Adair considered
this question, is a material one; suppose an



equivocal expression were used, should not I
prove by conversation of persons there how
they understood it; it is evidence that they
meant that their plan should go to such an
extent, then it becomes a secondary question,
whether the prisoner so understood it or not ;
it is an expression equivocal, and if it is proved
on the part of the prosecution that some
meant to go to that extent, it is open to the
prisoner to say it was not so meant by me,
nor did I so understand it. But the question
is now not upon the effect of the evidence, but
whether it ought or not to be received; and
inasmuch as it goes to the existence ofa con-
Spiracy, itseems to me that it must be re-
cited. What effect it will have must be
considered hereafter.

Mr. Justice Grose——I am of opinion this
evidence must be received for the purpose of
showing that there was a conspiracy, and
of what nature that conspiracy was. In this
case the address has just now been produced
and read; and in that address it appears that
Martin was the chairman, the prisoner the se-
cretary, and that there was a correspondence,
both between the prisoner and Margarot, and
between Martin and Margarot; that compli-
cates or implicates these three persons in a
business of this sort. Then is it not very ma-
terial for us to hear for the purpose of show-
ing the nature of the conspiracy, the extent
and the intention of the parties, what one con-
spirator writes to the uther, respecting these
very acts that are done in the course of trans-
actions relative to this very plan? And when
itis said that this is merely aconfession ora
writing, I think it is more because we know
very well that in many circumstances of this
sort it has been determined that, scribere est
agere ; and the writing here isan act, and it
is such ap act as may show the extent of the
plan, that there was a plan, it may show for
any thing I know the intention of the parties
to that plan. I confess, therefore, I am of
opinion that this evidence ought to be read.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Then now you
will read it.

Mr. William Walker (sworn)—Examined by
Mr. Garrow,

I believe you are an attorney ?—Yes.

an you acquainted with Mr. John Martin?
—Iam.

Are you acquainted with his character of
hand-writing ?—I am.

Be so good as look at that letter, and tell
me whether the whole of it, in your judgment,
is his writing, particularly the signature; do
you believe that to be Mr. Martin's hand-
writing ?—I do.

Be so good as louk at the superscription, do
you believe that likewise to be his hand-wri-
ting 2—I do.

“¢ My dear sir:—I dare say you think I have

forgot you, from my not having written to you,


but you know my sentiments so well that it wag
unnecessary for me, and would probably have
been improper to say much on the subject of
your mission ; and with regard to lord Ed-
ward, I have not been able to get any thing
like a settlement, To-morrow is the first
day of the term, when I shall rule the sheriff
to return the writ of summons.

“ We had a meeting on Monday. I was in
the chair. The newspaper gives our numbers
at 500, but we were nearer 1,500. Every
thing was well conducted, that is to say, re;
larly ; andthe roceedings were tolerably bold.
Mr. Hardy, I dave say, has sent you a copy of
the address and resolution.

“ Your conduct receives universal approba-
tion; and though I at one time dreaded the
want of money, yet that is now over. Those
who opposed the subscription at first, are now
putting their hands to the very bottom of their

ts, and swear by God you shall be sup-
ported with the last guinea. We must have
another general meeting in a chapel or some
large place, and declare the purpose of a sub-
scription, and, J think, we shall get plenty of
the needful for that and other purposes. Have
you read my letter to lord Lauderdale? Do
you incline to try the writ of error? What
do the Scotch lawyers think ofit? And what
do you think of the legal knowledge of my
countrymen? I firmly believe that the law
“A the only science of which they know no-
thing.

c The king went yesterday to meet his par-
liament. They sat till six o’clock this mor-
ning. The papers are notout; but I am told
only twelve members were for peace. I am
glad the minister has so great a majori
within doors for the war, and that the peop
have a greater majority without doors against
the war. The swinish rogues had the impu-
dence to write, no war, on all the doors and
corners of the Houses of Lords and Commons =
and they had even the audacity to an
hiss while his most sacred majesty was pass-
ing to, and from, the House. Nay, I am told,
a woman, moved and seduced by the instiga-
tion of the devil, and traitorously intending,
&c. did, in St. James’s Park, take off her patten
and threw it with all her force at his majesty,
whereby the glass of the state-coach was bro-
ken, and his majesty put in fear. God save
the king, for if, &c. (as Gerrald says),

« T am happy to find you are in good spirits
suffering the mild and just sentence of the
law. You may remember thatI told you to
be thankful if you were not hanged.

“ The society is increasing rapidly both in
spirit and in numbers; and the rich now be-
gin to come among us, and to sit down with
piscine among the honest men with the
leathern aprons.

“T could write to you strange things, but I
know not but this may be read by somebody
before it comes to your hands, therefore ex-
cuse the nonsense.

“ I think there is a struggle between Mrs,

Margarot and you, who: shall bear this with
greater fortitude, and that those who suffer
the least feel the most. WhenI read your
letter to the general mening I could see the
tear starting in the eyes of the honest men to
whom it was addressed, and the succeeding
groans helped'to relieve their swoln hearts.

“Tthink you should execute a power of at-
torney to some person, authorizing him to ‘act
for you generally, in case you should be hur
ried away. And if you think well of the’writ
of error, give me an authority, and I will im-
mediately set about it.

“ Between us, Muir and Palmer have put
themselves into the hands of the opposition,
who, I fear, will use their case no farther than
as an argument to help themselves into admi-
nistration.

“ Mrs, Martin desires me to say more for
her than Ihave.room. Were it not that you
ete safe enough, and ‘all of us married, I
would almost think her in love ; but itis with
w conduct more than your person, adieu.

“ Tolbooth January 24, 1794.

“ Dear Hardy;—I have just received your
letter, dated (by mistake I suppose) the 19th,
giving me an account of the dinner, of Ram-
say, and inclosing a 10/. note. I thank you,
my valuable friend, for the kind concern you
show; butI wish the society may not forget
me altogether; however, should they, I am
determined to pursue the same line of conduct
even if I must pursue it alone. I will, how-
ever, remark to youin private, and this letter
is meant as a private one, and you may make
what use you think fit of it, that the Sheffield
Society have behaved far differently from our
own, towards their delegate, and even towards
his family. Ifyou publish my trial, it might
be necessary to place a print of my handsome
figure in front, if so, Mrs. Margarot can fur-
nish you with a miniature, whence an engrav-
ing can be taken; if that is done, pray Ict the
engraver put into my hand the paper, con-
taining the questions to the lord justice Clerk,
and let the last of them be legible, viz. Did
you not say, that the mob would be the bet-
ter for losing a little blood ?

Tt will have a great effect on the public
mind: I was going to write a preface to the
trial, but on reading the account of the meet-
ing at the Globe tavern, I thought it migtit be


better for the society themselves to say some:
thing on that head’; but I must again observe,
that the Sheffield people seem more in earn
est than the Londoners. Pray write to Nor
wich : I hope Sutton has paid that bill; if so
let Mrs. M. send me 15/, of it, and after pay-
ing you, keep the remainder: I ask for that
money, because I am in arrears here more
than the society has sent me; I will endea-
vour, if I can collect a few of the extraordinary
expenses to send youa list of them. Since
my last, we have had: an additional padlock
putupon our door, and the captain of the
Tolbooth is not intrusted with the keys at
night, but delivers them to the magistrates,
and: calls for them again in the morning:
Every thing here shows fear on the one hand,
and discontent nearly ripe on the other: here
they make no dinners, but yet they meet. It
appears, that worthy Skirving was unnoticed in
your cups; the Scotch ladies, however, are
more kind than the London Corresponding
Society; and in the effects of their regard for
him, I partake. Gerrald is not yet arrived. I
sent the society (by the way of Sheffield) a copy
of Seott’s indictment ; they will make what
use they think proper of it. Has Martin done
any thing for me? The duke of Portland, now
that he joins ministry, and coalesces with the
landed gentlemen, ought to pay that bill for
his brother, lord Edward Bentinck, or they
both ought to be exposed to the world, and
the abuse of parliamentary seat-jobbing made
more public. Armed associations are, i pe r=
ceive, now set on foot by the rich, wherefore
should not the poor do the same? Are you
to wait patiently until 20,000 Hessians and
Hanoverians come to cut your throats ?—and
will you stretch forth your necks, like Iambs,
to the butcher’s knife, and, like lambs, con-
tent yourselves with bleating? Pray let me
hear from yousoon ; remember me to Mof-
fatt, Muir, Palmer, and all suffering brethren.

“ Fellow Citizens ;—-I am again authorized
to write to you, signifying the gratitude of
our society for your second epistle, which
came to my hands the Srd instant. After
reading its contents, I collected as many of
our friends as I conveniently could that even-
ing :~-we read—we blushed---we took cou-
rage; we did more, for we resolved on re-as-
sembling, as: we had appointed prior to the
determination we announced in ourlast. We
intend publishing an address, or something
‘declaratory of ouy sentiments, with all conve~
hient speed: as soon as this is effected, we
shall send a copy or copies to you. From the
Courier and Evening Gazette we have had in-
formation of the trial of Mr. Margarbt, and
his sentence to fourteen years transportation.
e are by no means at a loss in orming a
judgment of the noble cause in which he,
with others, are embarked, nor would we be
frightened at such sentences. You see, citi-
zens, your epistle has quickened our
eourage, and vivified our patriotism, and |
Toused us to resolution; and more, our num-
ber is now consideratly increased. Perha)
your third epistle may do greater things still:
we are sensible ’tis a noble---’tis a_ virtuous—~
%tis a godlike and immortal cause in which we
are now mutually embarked ; and though, for
parts, our effort can be but a feeble one, yet
he cause we espouse is mighty-—is energetic ;
— it will finally prevail and prosper. It is our
firm opinion, could we but arouse them, that
patriots would become nearly the majority of
our city. We expected to have had the dozen
of the Englishmen’s Rights, which you men-
tioned in your first epistle.~~Hope you will
send them speedily.—-We are, fellow citizens,

“ Citizens !---The critical moment is ar-
tived, and Britons must either assert with
zeal and firmness their claims to liberty, or
yield without resistance, to the chains that
ministerial usurpation is forging for them.
Will you co-operate with us in the only peace
able measure that now presents itself with any
prospect of success? We need not intimate
to you, that notwithstanding the unparalleled
audacity of a corrupt and overbearing faction,
which at present tramples on the rights and
Tiberties of the people, our meetings cannot in
England be interrupted without the previous
adoption of a convention-bill, a measure it is
our duty to anticipate, that the ties of union
may be more firmly drawn, and the senti-
ments and views of the different societies
throughout the nation be compared, while it |
is yet in our power, so as to guide and direct
the future operations of the friends to freedom.
Rouse then to one exertion more; and let us
show our consciousness of this important |
truth: ‘If we are to be beaten down with |
‘threats, prosecutions, and illegal sentences, we |
‘are unworthy—we are incapable of liberty.’
We must, however, be expeditious: Hessians
and Austrians are already among us! and, if
we tamely submit, a cloud of these armed bar-
ians may shortly be poured. in upon us:


Tet us form then another British Convention ;
we have a central situation in our view, which
we believe would be most convenient for the
whole island; but which we forhear to men
tion (intreating your confidence in this parti-
cular) till we have the answer of the societies
with which we are im correspondence. Let
us have your answer then, by the 2Uth at
farthest—earlier, if possible, whether you a)

prove of the measure, and how many de

gates you can send, with the mumber also, if
possible, of your sucieties——We remain yours,

* Fellow Citizeiis,—The Society in Stratha-
"ven received your circnlarletter some fime ago,
respecting another British Convention, to be
held in England; and finding it would be in-
convenient for them to send a delegate for
themselves alone, the cause being mach sup-
pressed here by prosecutions, which we are
subjected to from the petty sheriffs in our

‘the societies in Kilmarnock, Galston, New-
-mills, and Dorvill; accordingly a meeting of
delegates from these societies, and that in
Strathaven, was convened on the first current,
whcre the measure met with the fullest appro-
bation, and a delegate was elected for the ge-
neral convention, and a secret committee aj
pointed to conduct the business.—You will,
therefore, forward your orders to us, when

judge necessary; we shall instruct our dele-

“ By desire of a number of friends to a ra-

free to trouble you—We live in a place where
an aristocrat magistracy endeavours to stop
the genial and benign spirit of national liberty
from spreading, notwithstanding a very great
number are found here that dare assert the
natural and: unalienable rights of man, and
bear their testimony against the tyrannical
encroachments of assumed power on those

sumed no name but that of Newspaper-com-

“ Citizen ;—It is with pleasure the London
Corresponding Society hear that a society om
a similar plan, and with the same patriotic
objects in view, is likely to be established at
Newcastle-upon-Tyne. If ever a crisis ar-
rived that required the exertions of the people
to stop the torrent of corruption, infamy, and
despotism that seems likely to overwhelm
them, it is the present. In God’s name, ther,
let us use these exertions. We are called
upon by every thing that is dear to us, as men
and as Christians. The cause of truth and
liberty must finally be omnipotent; therefore
doubt not that the glorious reign of liberty
and equality will ere Jong be established; and
modern governments, with every appen
of wickedness and corruption, will flee, in
time, from their genial influence, as beasts of
prey to their dens of rapine and darkness from
the rising sun. The London Corresponding
Society have beheld with indignation the
rapid advances of despotism in Britain, and
are ready cordially to unite with every other
society in the three kingdoms, who have for
their object a full and effectual sg ae
tion of the people; they therefore have de-
puted six of their members to meet six of the
members of the Society for Constitutional In-
formation, to form a committee of corres-
pondence and co-operation. This committee
meets regularly twice a week, at No. 2, Beau-
fort Buildings, Strand, where any member
delegated by your society will meet with every
information required. We inclose you a few
of our resolutions entered into at our general
meeting, on the 14th of April, which will be
sufficiently explanatory of ovr sentiments and
views. We heartily unite with you in wish-
ing that the hydra of tyranny and imposition
may soon fall under the guillotine of truth and
reason.”

“ Fellow Citizen ;—You. may be sensible,
from our last communication, that, in the in-
fancy of our patriotic efforts, we had many
difficulties to overcome, and many strong pre-
judices to combat. We laid open to you our
teal situation; we told you our determination
 485)"
to address the public, and assured you of our
unalterable perseverance in the glorious cause
of freedom.— This perseverance, however, and
these.exertions of an individual society, can
but little avail, if the societies in the different
parts of the kingdom are in themselves dis-
united, ve do me aid a aesitt is other,
eable to the principles of philanthropy
ety fraternity which they so warmly profess.
Under this idea, we conceive ourselves treated
with a degree of incivism, by f bd society not
answering our last letters; the reasons may
be good.—At present, we are candid enough
to confess that the circumstance does not ap-
pear to us in the most favourable point of view.
Our address, of which we send you a few
copies, we find to have a good effect, and is
l&kely to beget us the assistance of many
friends, while our enemies acknowledge there
is something very fair and reasonable in the
production. This is an absolute weuny and
we have reason to congratulate ourselves on
the prospect of success it opens to us. With
a mixture of pain and pleasure, we saw an ac-
count of your last general meeting. We la-
ment that the strong hand of despotism should
so often interfere to prevent the assertion of
the rights of the people, while we rejvice in
your manly constitutional perseverance, and
applaud and approve your resolution of form-
ing another general convention. Our in-
creasing numbers give us every reasonable
hope of soon being able more effectually to
co-operate -with you; while, for the reasons
formerly stated, we cannot yet make a posi-
tive promise on that head. We hope for an
immediate answer. Favour us with your opi-
aion of our address, and transmit a sketch of
your plan respecting the general convention.

to avail myself of their information. I have
therefore troubled you with this letter, re-

« Fellow Citizen ;—In answer to your letter
dated the 12th ult. Iam desired to inform’
you, the London Corresponding Society have
in view not only the glorious design of in-
creasing the knowledge of the community, bi
of redressing their grievances. This Rite
hope to do by straining every nerve in union
with other societies already established, and
establishing, in every part of the kingdom, to
procure universal suffrage and annual parlia-
ments, as the only likely means to annihilate
the present most abominable system of cor-
ruption, and to stop the rapid advances of
despotism—a monster whose hideous features"
need only be exposed to render it an object of:
universal terror and detestation, but whose
gaudy trappings have too long dazzled the
eyes of our countrymen.

“ To expose vice, to paint virtue in its true
colours, to acquaint our fellow citizens with
their dearest rights, the rights of mun; and,
by a brotherly union, give them an opportu-
nity of demanding those rights, are the ‘ means*
we use; and we doubt not, but in exertin
those means, we are doing our duty to Go
and our country ; for, as Pope says, :
“ Jove fixt it certain, that whatever day
“ Made man a slave, took half his worth away.”

Mr. Garrow.—Inow propose to read a letter
from a society at Sheffield, addressed to the
prisoner; it does not appear that any part of it
1s in his hand-writing ; it is found in the pos-
session of Thelwall, who, as your lordship re-
collects, appears to have been in some in-
stances an agent of that London Correspond-
ing Society of which Hardy was aectelaty

t, Erskine. The principle upon which the

last piece of evidence was admitted was vel
distinctly stated by your lordships, that it
might be evidence to show a conspiracy so
called, yet would not go to affect the prisoner,
unless it could be brought home to him. The
only remark I make upon this is, how does it
appear to be the same Sheffield Society with
which this society was in correspondence?
Is it written in the same hand-writing? Does
it profess to be written by the same person
who betore corresponded with the prisoner?
- Mr Garrow. We do not state this is the
Sheffield society with which they corre-
panded; I state it to be from a society at
Sheffield, with which town they were in cor-
respondence, signed by a person purporting
to be a secretary ; but if my friends object to
it, we will not trouble them to argue it.

Mr. Erskine.—I certainly do object to it.
~ Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I think this let-
ter is iy a different situation from the other.
It is a Jetter purporting to come from one of
these societies ; it is addressed to the prisoner,
and it is found in the hands of a person affect-
ed by the evidence, at least to involve him in
this conspiracy.

onday, April 2ist, 1794, at which were
many friends from Leeds, Wakefield, Hud-
dersfield, Bradford, and the adjacent neigh-
bourhood, the friends of freedom after the
meeting agreed to hold a general meeting of
delegates at Bristol, in order to consider on

as possible on that important business. We
are not in the least intimidated in Sheffield,

Mr. Garrow.—Was this paper found in thé

“ The delegation from Glasgow moves, that
the convention take into their considerations
the nature and extent of a resolution adopted
by their constituents, and by most of the other
| societies in Scotland, and afterwards ratified
‘ and approved of at the general convention
held at Edinburgh, in December, 1792; the
import of which was, that if any member of
their society, associated for the purpose of
obtaining a parligmentary reform,
while in the legal prosecution of that object
be oppressed or pereecuves by the arm of
power, they should not only meet with the
: assistance of the society to which they
| but also with the united efforts of al) their bree
thren in Scotland.

“ Since the above period, however, we are
sorry to say, several of our members have
been persecuted, and that in a most wanton
manner; and the above resolution (which if
duly putin force, would, we humbly appre-
hend, have the happy effect of emboldeni
those who haye already come forward, and
; encouraging others who have not yet taken
; any active part to unite their efforts in the
general cause) has never yet been attended to,

“ We therefore humbly move, that the cone

* Sir;—I am directed by the Society for

their sincere thanks for the honour you have
done them, in requesting them to become
trustees of the sum of one thousand pounds,
which has been produced by the profits of
the sale of the Rights of Man, and leaving it
to them to apply it to such purposes as they
should judge proper. They have a just sense
of the confidence that you have placed in
them, and of the generosity and disinterested-
ness of your offer, but they cannot think that
it is an offer they should accept. The emi-
nent services which have been rendered to
the public by your invaluable writings, have
never yet met with an adequate reward, and
they think that it would be an extreme in-
justice to deprive you of any benefits which

_might be derived from their sale; for itis but
reasonable, that those who are possessed of
literary talents, and who employ them to
_Promote the happiness of the community to
. which they belong, and to mankind at large,
should receive those advantages which may
be obtained by their writings, and which may
be enjoyed with integrity and honour. But
though the society decline the offer which
you have. been pleased to make them, they

cannot do it, without,.at the same time, con.
gratulating you upon the consciousness which
you must possess of having contributed, by
your writings, to the illumination of so many
millions of human beings, in this country,
America, an in other nations, on subjects of
the highest importance to the universal free«
dom and happiness of mankind. I am, with

agrecable to him, that the two resolutions of
the committee appointed to take Mr. Paine’s

Mr. Bower—I shall now call the bookseller
who published Mr, Paine’s book.

Jeremiah Samuel Jordan sworn.—Examined by
: Mr. Bower. "

Do you know Mr. Thomas Paine ?—Yes.

Pe you know: his hand-writing ?—I think
I do. ‘

Look at that letter; do you believe that to
be his hand-writing?—To the best of my re-
collection this is Kke his writing; I never
saw him write. .

Have you corresponded with him ?—I have
received notes from him.

And answered them ?—No.

How do you know the notes came from
him? has he afterwards told you that they
were his notes?— Because | delivered things
according to his order, therefore supposed
them to come from him; but I never saw
him write, so as to take particular notice.

Have you ever talked with him about those
notes, or of things that were sent in conse-
quence ?—I do not know that I have,

Did you publish, at any time, for Mr. Paine,
a work, intituled, “ Rights of Man?”—I did.

Look at this, and tell us whether that is
the book that you published ?—This is one like
them; whether this is one of the same books
I cannot tell; here is my name to it, and it
is like that which I published.

Do you believe it to be one of the books
that you published ?—F believe it is one of
the books that I might publish. .

Mr. Erskine.—Do you swear to that book,
that it is one you published ?—I cannot swear
that it is; there were a great number sold
that were not sold by me.

Mr. Bower.—Look at it, and see whether

it is one of the books pa published ?—It is

one of the same as I published for Mr. Paine.
Is it like the book you published? :

. Mr. Erskine.—Is that the book or not?
If that is not the book I object to it. |
"Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Who printed it?
—Mr. Chapman printed part of it. Of the
first part of the Rights of Man, Mr. Chap-
man® printed the whole. This is the second
art.

P Mr. Bower.—1 thought you had been the
printer ?—No, I am only the publisher,

Mr. White—The man is dead that bought
it, and I must call a witness to prove hi
hand-writing. That was proved in a court of
justice.

Mr. Bower.—I have the record of a con-
viction, in which Paine was convicted: this
‘witness was examined upon his oath there,
and I can prove what he swore then, which I
submit will be evidence.

Mr. Erskine.—That was the king against
Mr. Paine; thisis the king against Mr. Hardy.

Mr. Garrow.—I think I am entitled, at
present, to read this as evidence to go to the
jury ; I know it is open to the other side to
show that this is not the Rights of Man re-
eognized by this society.—We can carry it
farther.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre. —The rule of
evidence requires that you should carry it
farther.

- Mr. Bower.—Do you know how far Mr.
Chapman printed? —I believe as far as
Jetter H.

Mr. Bower.—I will now read the proceed-
ings of the Constitutional Society, at their
next meeting, on the 28th of September.

“To D. Adams, secretary to the Society for
Constitutional Information.

“ Sir;—The London Corresponding So-
ciety having taken the resolution of transmit-
ting to the French National Convention, an
address, signed by all the members, or by
the different delegates (each stating for how
many members he signs), to assure that suf-
fering nation, that we sympathise with them
in their misfortunes ; that we view their ex-

—


ertions with admiration ; that we wish to give
them all such countenance and support as
individuals, unsupported and oppressed them«
selves, can afford; and that should those in
power here—dare (in vivlation of the nation’s
pledged faith of neutrality, and in opposition
to the well-known sentiments of the people
at large) to join the German band of despots,
united against liberty, we disclaim all concur-
rence therein; and will, to a man, exert
every justifiable. means for counteracting their
machinations against the freedom and happi-
ness of uankind.

“T am ordered by the committee to ac-
quaint the Society for Constitutional Infor--
mation therewith, in order to be favoured
with their opinion thereon, and in hopes
that, if they approve the idea, and recommend
its adoption to the different societies, the
publication of such a respectable number of
real names will greatly check the hostile
measures which might otherwise be put in
execution. I am, with great respect, dear
sir, your very humble servant.

“ Resolved, that the secretary express the
thanks of the society to the London Corres-’

acquaint them this society do very highly
approve of their intention.

“ Ordered, That the said letter be read at
the next meeting, for the purpose of consi-
dering of publishing the same.

“ Read a letter from the London Corres-
ponding Society, enclosing a printed address
to the inhabitants of Great Britain.”

Mr. Bower.—There is in the meeting of
the 5th, a confirmation of these minutes,

Mr. Garrow.—I shall now produce a copy
of one of the cheap editions of Paine’s Rights
of Man, and Mr. Paine’s Letter to the People
of France, both found in possession of the
prisoner.

Mr. Edward Lauzun again called.

Mr. Garrow.—Is that one of the papers you
found at the prisoner’s house ?—Ycs; there
is my name to it.

Did you find the other there?—Yes,

Mr. Erskine.—Is your lordship of opinion
that any printed book which is -tound in the
possession of the prisoner is to be read.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—It is evidence to
be left to the jury.

Mr. Garrow. —We do not interrupt the
course of proceedings by reading the es
out of Paine’s book ; at present we will go on
with other evidence. . A

Lord Chief Justice Eyre——When are we
to take up that? If we-are ever to have it,
we may as well have it now.

Mr. Garrow.—Then we will read Mr.
Paine’s Letter to the people of France.

[Tt was read.]

Letter of Thomas Paine, to the People of
France. Published and distributed gratis
by the London Corresponding Society.

“ Paris, September 25.
« (First Year of the Republic.)

“ Fellow Citizens;—I receive, with affec-
tionate Eratitade, the honour which the late
National Assembly has conferred upon me,
by adopting me a citizen of France; and the

ditional honour of being elected by my
fellow-citizens a member of the National Con-
vention. Happily impressed, as I am, by
those testimonies of respect shown towards
me as an individual, I feel my felicity in-
creased by seeing the barrier broken down
that divided patriotism by spots of earth, and
limited citizenship to the soil, like vegetation.

“Had those honours been conferred in an
hour of national tranquillity, they would
have afforded no other means of showing my
affection, than to have accepted and enjoyed
them ; but they come accompanied with cir-
cumstances that give me the honourable
portunity of commencing my citizenship in
the stormy hour of difficulties. I come not
to enjoy repose. Convinced that the cause
of France is the cause of all mankind,
and that as liberty cannot be purchased by a
wish, I gladly share with you the dangers
and honours necessary to success.

“1 am well aware that the moment of any
inp change, such as that accomplished on
the 10th of August, is unavoidably the mo-
ment of terror and confusion, The mind,
highly agitated by hope, suspicion, and ap-
prehension, continues without rest till the
change be accomplished. But let us now
look calmly and confidently forward, and suc-
cess is certain. It is no longer the paltr
cause of kings, or of this, or of that indivi-
dual, that calls France and her armies into
action. It is the great cause of aru. Itis the
establishment of a new era, that shall blot des-
potism from the earth, and fix, on the lasting
principles of peace and citizenship, the great
republic of man.

“Tt:has been my fate to have borne a share
in the commencement and complete esta-
blishment of one revolution (I meafi the revo-
lution of America). The success and events
of that revolution are encouraging to us. The
ey. and ianpinesy: sat have since

jowed to that country, have amply rewarded
her for all the hardships she endured, and for
all the dangers she encountered.

“ The principles on which that revolution
began, -have extended themselves to Europe ;
and an over-ruling Providence is repesereing
the Old World by the principles of the New.
The gah ere Som a Asse other
pats of , did not admit of her carry-
ing those principles beyond her own situation.
It 1s to the peculisr honour of France, that
she now raixes the seumiard of liberty for all

495]

nations; and in fighting hes own battles,
contends for the rights of all mankind.

“The same spirit of fortitude that insured
success to America, will insure it to France,
for it is impossible to conquer a nation deter-
mined to be free! The military circumstances
that now unite themselves to France, are suc!
as the despots of the earth know nothing of,
and can’ form no caleulation upon
know not what it is to fight: against a nation,
They have only been accustomed to make war’
upon each other, and they know from systeny
and practice, how to calcilate the probable
success of despot against despot; and here’
their knowledge and their experience ends.

“ But in a contest like the present, a new
and boundless variet yer circumstances arises,
that deranges all such customary calculations.
When: a whole nation acts as an army, the
despot knows not the extent of the power
against which he contends. New armies rise’
against him with the necessity of the moment.
It is then that the difficulties of an-invading
enemy multiply, as in the former case they
diminished ; and he finds them at their height
when he expected them to end.

“The only war that has any mouarity oF
circumstances with the present, is the late
revolution-war in America. Qa her part, as
it now is in France, it was a war of the whole
nation.—There it was that the enemy, by be-
ginning to conquer, put himself in a condition
of being conquered. His first victories pre-
pared him for defeat. He advanced till he
could not retreat, and found himself in the
midst of a nation of armies.

“ Were it now to be proposed to the Aus-
trians and Prussians to escort them into the
middle of France, and there leave them to
make the most of such a situation, they
would see too much into the danger of it to
accept the offer, and the same dangers would
attend them could they arrive there by any
other means. Where then is the military
policy of their attempting to obtain by force,
that which they would refuse by choice? But
to reason with despots is throwing reason
away. The best of arguments is a vigurous
preparation.

“Man is ever a stranger to the ways by
which Providence regulates the order of
things. The interference of foreign despots
may serve to introduce into their own enslaved
countries the principles they come to oppose,
Liberty and equality are blessings too great to
be the inheritance of Frauce alone. It is ho-~
nour to her to be their first champion ; and
she may now say to her enemies, with @
mighty voice, ‘O! ye Austrians, ye Prus-
‘slans! ye who now turn your bayonets
“against us; it is for all Europe; it is tor alt
* mankind, and not for France alone, that sho
“raises the standard of Liberty and Equality.”

“The public cause has hitherto suffered
from the contradictions contained in the con-
stitution of the former Constituent Assembly.
Those contradictions have served to divide

the opinions of individuals at home, and to
obscure the great principles of the revolution
in other countries. But when those contra-
dictions shall be removed, and the constitu-
tion be made conformable to the declaration
of rights; when the bagatelles of monarghy,
royalty, regency, and hereditary succession,
shall be exposed, with all their absurdities, a
new ray of light will be thrown over the
world, and the revolution will derive new
strength by being universally understood.

« The scene that now opens itself to France
extends far beyond the houndaries of her own
dominions. Every nation is becoming her
colleague, and every court is become her
enemy. It is now the cause of all nations
against the cause of all courts. The terror
that despotism felt, clandestinely begot a con-
federation of despots; and their attack upon
France was produced by their fears at home.

** In entering on this great scene, greater
than apy nation has yet been called to act in,
let us say to the agitated mind, be calm. Let
us punish by instructing, rather than by re-
venge. Jet us begin the new era by a great-
ness of friendship, and hail the approach of
union and success. Your fellow citizen,

“Tuomas Parner.”

Thomas Chapman sworn.—Examined by
Mr, Garrow.

What are you by business ?—A bookseller.

Were you acquainted with Mr. Thomas
Paine ?—I was.

Ve you at any time print any book for him?
—I di

What wasit?—A work intituled Rights of:

Man.

Did you print one or two parts of that
work ?—I printed the first part and part of the
second.

Was it at the earlier part of the second part
as you call it, or the latter part ?—The earlier

Pevou did not finish it ?—I did not.

Look at these two books, and tell me whe-
ther you believe these to be copies printed by
you ?—-I pened the first part entirely.

How far did you proceed in printing the
second part ?—I think I printed as far ee leur
K, that is, I finished what we call the letter
or signature of sheet I, which includes the
128th page; the larger edition, I had the
copy of almost the whole of the remaining
fart, and my people had composed it, or set
it up in the type, but I did not conclude it,

hat did you do with that part you did not
finish ?—Returned it into the hands of Mr.
Paine by a servant of mine.

After the book was completed, did you ever
converse with Mr. Paine about it?—I do not
think I saw Mr. Paine om the business after
the work was quite finished.

[The following passages were read from
the first part of the “ Rights of Man.”)

(Page 57, 8vo. and page 94, 12m editions.)



—* Can then Mr. Burke produce the English
constitution? 1f he cannot, wo may fairly
conclude, that though it has been so muc!
talked about, no such thing as a constitution
exists, or ever did exist, and consequently
that the people have yet a constitution to
form.”

(Page 59, Bvo. and page 25, 12mo. edi-
tions.)—* A government on the principles on
which constitutional governments arising out
of society are established, cannot have the
right of altering itself. If it had, it would be
arbitrary. It might make itself what it
pleased; and wherever such a right is set up,
it shows there is no constitution. The act by
which the English parliament empowered
itself to sit seven years, shows there is no
constitution in England. It might, by the
same self-authority, have sat any greater
number of years, or for life. “The Bill which
the present Mr, Pitt brought into parliament
some years ago, to reform parliament, was on
the same erroneous principle. The right of
reform is in the nation in its original charac-
ter, and the constitutional method would be
by a general convention elected for the pur-

se. There is, moreover, a paradox in the
idea of vitiated bodies reforming themselves.”

(Page 63, 8vo. and 27, 12mo. editions.)—~
“ Much is to be learned from the French con-
stitution. Conquest and tyranny transplanted
themselves with William the Conqueror from
Normandy into England, and the country is
yet disfigured with the marks, May then the
example of all France contribute to regene-
rate the freedom which a province of it dee
stroyed !" .

(Page 161, 8vo. and page 74, 12mo. edi-
tions.}—“ The two modes of government
which prevail in the world, are, first, govern-
ment by election and representation : secondly,
poreenmnent by hereditary succession. The
former is generally known by the name of
republic; the latter by that of monarchy and
aristocracy. .

“Those two distinct and opposite forms,
erect themselves on the two distinct and
posite bases of reason and ignorance.—As the
exercise of government recite talents and
abilities, and as talents and abilities cannot
have hereditary descent, it is evident that
hereditary succession requires a belief from
man, to which his reason cannot subscribe,
and which can only be established upon his
ignorance ; and the more ignorant any country
is, the better it is fitted for this species of
government.”

(Page 165, 8vo. and page 76, 12mo. edi-
tions.)—“ From the revolutions of America
and France, and the symptoms that have
appeared in other countries, it is evident that
the opinion of the world is changed with
respect to systems of government, and that
revolutions are not within the compass of
political calculations. The progress of time
and circumstances, which men assign to the
accomplishment of great changes, is too

2K

mechanical to measure the force of the mind,
and the rapidity of reflection, by which revolu-
tions are generated : all the old governments
have received a shock from those that already
appear, and which were once more improbable,
and are a greater subject of wonder, than a
general revolution in Europe would be now.

“ When we survey the wretched condition
of man under the monarchical and hereditary
systems of government, dragged from his
home by one power, or driven by another, and
‘impoverished by taxes more than by enemies,
it becomes evident that those systems are bad,
and that a general revolution in the principle
and construction of governments is necessary.

“ What is government more than the man-
agement of the affairs of a nation? It is not,
and from its nature cannot be, the property of
any particular man or family, but of the
whole community, at whose expense it is
supported ; and though by force or contrivance
it has been usurped into an inheritance, the
usurpation cannot alter the right of things.
Sovereignty, as a matter of right, appertains to
the nation only, and not to any individual ;
and a nation has at all times an inherent in-
defeasible right to abolish any form of govern-
Ment it finds inconvenient, and establish such
as accords with its interest, disposition, and
happiness. The romantic and barbarous dis-
tinction of mer into kings and subjects, though
it may suit the condition of courtiers, cannot
that of citizens ; and is exploded by the prin-
ciple upon which governments are now
founded. Every citizen is a member of the
sovereignty, and, as such, can acknowledge no
personal subjection ; and his obedience can be
only to the laws.

“ When men think of what government is,
they must necessarily suppose it to possess a
knowledge of all the objects and matters upon
which its authority is to be exercised. In this
view of government, the republican system, as
established by America and France, operates
to embrace the whole of a nation; and the
knowledge necessary to the interest of all the
parts, is to be found in the centre, which the
parts by representation form: but the old
governments are on a construction that ex-
cludes knowledge as well as happiness; go-
vernment by monks, who know nothing of
the world beyond the walls ofa convent, is as
consistent as government by kings.

“What were formerly called revolutions,
were little more than a change of persons, or
an alteration of local circumstances. They
rose and fell like things of course, and had
nothing in their existence or their fate that
could influence beyond the spot that produced
them. But what we now see in the world,
from the revolutions of America and France,
is a renovation of the natural order of things,
a system of principles as universal as truth
and the existence of man, and combinin,
moral with political happiness and nation:
prosperity.

_ 1, Men are born and always continue free,


and equal in respect of their rights. Civil
distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on
public utility.

“ 2. The end of all political associations is
the preservation of the natural and imprescrip-
tible rights of man ; and these rights are liberty,
property, security, and resistance of oppression.

“3. The nation is essentially the source of all
sovereignty ; nor can any INDIVIDUAL, Or ANY
BODY OF MEN, be entitled to any authority which
is not expressly derived from it.” ,

(Page 171, 8vo. and page 78, 12mo. edi-
tions. —“ As it is not difficult to perceive;
from the enlightened state of mankind, that
hereditary governments are verging to their
decline, and that revolutions on the broad
basis of national sovereignty, and government
by representation, are making their way in
Europe, it would be an act of wisdom to anti
cipate their approach, and produce revolutions
by reason and accommodation, rather than
commit them to the issue of convulsions.

“ From what we now sce, nothing of reform
in the political world ought to be held impro-
bable. It is an age of revolutions, in which
every thing may be looked for. The intrigue
of courts, by which the system of war is kept
up, may provoke a contederation of nations to
abolish it: and an European congress, to
patronize the progress of free government, and
promote the civilization of nations with each
other, is an event nearer in probability, than
once were the revolutions and alliance of
France and America.”

[The following passages were read from the
Second Part of the “ Rights of Man.”}

(Page 21, 8vo. edition.)—* All hereditary

vernment is, in its nature, tyranny.—An
Reritable crown, or an heritable throne, or by
what other fanciful name such things may be
called, have no other significant explanation
than that mankind are heritable property.
To inherit a government is to inherit the
people, as if they were flocks and herds.”

(Page 27, 8vo. edition.}—“ How irrational
then isthe hereditarysystem, which establishes
channels of power, in company with which
wisdom refuses to flow.—By continuing this
absurdity, man is perpetually in contradiction
with himself’; he accepts, for a king, or a chief
magistrate, or a legislator, a person whom he
would not elect for a constable.”

(Page 47, 8vo. edition.—* This convention
met at Philadelphia, in May, 1787, of which
Gencral Washington was elected president.
He was not, at that time, connected with any
of the state governments, or with con
He delivered up his commission when the
war ended, and since then had lived a private
citizen.

“ The convention went deeply into all the
subjects; and having, after a variety of debate
ain investigation, agreed among themselves
upon the several parts of a federal constitution,
the next question was, the manner of giving it
authority and practice. |

« For this purpose they did not, like a cabal
of courtiers, send for a Dutch stadtholder, or a
German elector ; but they referred the whole
matter to the sense and interest of the country.

“ They first directed, that the proposed
constitution should be published. Secondly,
that each state shoul, elect a convention,
expressly for the purpose of taking it into
consideration, and of ratifying or rejecting it ;
and that as soon as the approbation and ratifi-
cation of any nine states should be given, that
those states should proceed to the eléction of
their proportion of members to the new federal
government, and that the operation of it
should then begin, and the former federal
government cease.”

(Page 52, 8vo. edition.“ The history of
the Edwards and the Henries, and up to the
commencement of the Stuarts, exhibits as
many instances of tyranny as could be acted
within the limits to which the nation had
restricted it. The Stuarts endeavourcd to

8 those limits, and their fate is well known.
In all those instances, we sce nothing of a
constitution, but only of restrictions, or as-
sumed power.

“After this another William, descended
from the same stock, and claiming from the
same origin, gained possession ; and, of the
two evils, James and William, the nation pre-
ferred what it thought the least; since, from
circumstances, it must take one. The act,
called the Bill of Rights, comes here into
view, What is it but a bargain, which the
parts of the government made with each
other, to divide powers, profits, and privileges:
you shall have 30 much, and I will have the
rest; and, with respect to the nation, it suid,
for your share, YOU shall have the right of
petitioning. This being the case, the Bill of
Rights is, more properly, a bill of wrongs, and
of insult. As to whatis called the convention
parliament, it was a thing that made itself,
and then made the authority by which it
acted. A few persons got together, and called
themselves by that name. Several of them
had never been elected, and none of them for
the purpose.

“From the time of William a species of

vernment arose, issuing out of this coalition

ill of Rights ; and more so, since the corrup-

tion introduced at the Hanover succession, by
the agency of Walpole; that can be described
by no other name than a despotic legislation.
Though the parts may embarrass each other,
the sinle has no bounds; and the only right
it acknowledges, out of itself, is the right of
petitioning. Where then is the constitution,
either that gives, or that restrains power ?
_ “Itis not because a part of the government
is elective, that makes it less a despotism, if
the persons so elected possess afterward, as a
parliament, unlimited powers. Election, in
this case, becomes separated from representa-
tion, and the candidates are candidates for
despotism.

“ T cannot believe that any nation, reason-


ing on its own rights, would have thought of
calling those things a constitution, if the cry
of constitution had not been sct up by the
government.”

(Page 63, 8vo. edition—a note.)—“ * With
respect to the two houses of which the English
parliament is composed, they appear to be
effectually influenced into one; and, as a
legislature, to have no temper of its own.
The minister, whoever he at any time may be,
touches it as with an opium wand, and it
sleeps obedience. hs

“ But if we look at the distinct abilities of
the two houses, the difference will appear so
great, as to shew the inconsistency of placing
power where there can be no certainty of the
judgment to use it. Wretched as the state of
Tepresentation is in England, it is manhood
compared with what is called the House of
Lords ; and so little is this nick-named house
regarded, that the people scarcely inquire, at
any time, what it is doing. It appears also to
be most under influence, and the furthest
removed from the general interest of the na-
tion. In the debate on engaging in the
Russian and Turkish war, the majority in the
House of Peers, in favour of it, was upwards of
ninety; when in the other house, which is
more than double its numbers, .the majority
was sixty-three.”

(Page 65, 8vo. edition.) —“ But in whatever
manner the separate parts of a constitution
may be arranged, there is one general prin-
ciple that distinguishes freedom from slavery,
which is, that all hereditary government over
a people is to them a species of fslavery, and
representative government is freedom,’,

(Page 107, 8vo. edition.)— Having thus
glanced at some of the defects of the two
houses of parliament, I proceed to what is
called the crown, upon which I shall be very
concise,

* It signifies a nominal office of a million
sterling a year, the business of which consists
in receiving the money.—Whether the person
be wise or foolish, sane or insane, a native or
a foreigner, matters not. Every ministry acts
upon the same idea that Mr. Burke writes ;
namely, that the people must be hood-winked,
and held in superstitious ignorance by some
bugbear or other; and what is called the
crown answers this purpose, and therefore it
answers all the purposes to be expected from
it. This is more than can be said of the other
two branches.”

© Burke, and with the same zeal.’

“ In the first place, it has not yet been done
by any body. Not less, I believe, than eight
or ten pamphlets intended as answers to the
former part of the ‘ Rights of Man’ have been
published by different persons, and not one of
them, to my knowledge, has extended to a
second edition, nor are even the titles of them
so much as generally remembered. As I am
averse to unnecessarily multiplying publica-
tions, I have answered none of them. And
as I believe that a man may write himself out
of reputation when nobody else can do it, I
am careful to avoid that rock.

But as I would decline urnecessary publi-
eations on the one hand, so would I avoid every
thing that might appear like sullen pride on the
other. If Mr. Burke, or any person on his side
the question, will produce an answer to the
« Rights of Man,’ that shall extend to an half, or
even to a fourth part of the number of copies
to which the Rights of Man extended, I will
reply to his work. But until this be done, I
shall so far take the sense of the public for
my guide (and the world knows I am not a
flatterer) that what they do not think worth
while to read, is not worth mine to answer. I
suppose the number of copies to which the
first part of the Rights of Man extended,
taking England, Scotland, and [reland, is not
tess than between forty and fifty thousand.

“T now come to remark on the remaining
part of the quotation I have made from Mr.
Burke.

“ ¢Tf) says he, ‘such writings shall be
‘ thought to deserve any other refutation than
‘ that of criminal justice.”

“ Pardoning the pun, it must be criminal
justice indeed that should condemn a work as
a substitute for not being able to refute it.
The greatest condemnation that could be
passed upon it would be a refutation. But
in proceeding by the method Mr. Burke
alludes to, the condemnation would, in the
final event, pass upon the criminality of the
process and not tspon the work, and in this
case, I had rather be the author, than be
either the judge, or the jury, that should con-
demn it.

« But to come at once to the point. Thave
differed from some professional gentlemen on
the subject of prosecutions, and I since find
they are falling into my opinion, which I will
here state as fully, but as concisely as I can.

“ | will first put a case with respect to any

law, and then compare it with a government,
or with what in England is, or has been called
a constitution.
. “ It would be an act of despotism, or what
in England is called arbitrary power, to make
a law to prohibit investigating the principles,
good or bad, on which such a law, or any other
is founded.

“* Ifa lew be bad, it is one thing to oppose


the practice of it, but it is quite a different
thing to expose its errors, to reason on its
defects, and to show cause why it should be
repealed, or why another ought to be substi+
tuted in its place. I have always held it an
opinion (making it also my practice) that it is
better to obey a bad law, making use at the
same time of every argument to show its
errors and procure its repeal, than forcibly to
violate it; Mecaine the precedent of bree
a bad law might weaken the force, and }

to a discretionary violation, of those which
ate good.

“ THe case is the same with respect to prin-
ciples and forms of government, or to what
are called constitutions and the parts of which
they are composed.

* It is for the good of nations, and not for
the emolument or aggrandizement of par-
ticular individuals, that government ought to
be established, and that mankind are at the
expence of supporting it. The defects of
every government and constitution, both as to
principle and form must, on a parity of rea-
soning, be as open to discussion as the defects
of a law, and itis a duty which every man
owes to society to point them out. When
those defects, and the means of remedying
them are generally seen by a nation, that
nation will reform its government or its con-
stitution in the one case, as the government
repealed or reformed the law in the other,
The operation of government is restricted to
the making and the administering of laws;
but it is to a nation that the right of forming
or reforming, generating or regenerating con+
stitutions and governments belong ; and con-
sequently those subjects, as subjects of in-
vestigation, are always before a country as a °
matter of right. aud cannot, without invading
the general rights of that country, be made
subjects for prosecution. On this ground I
will meet Mr. Burke whenever he please. It
is better that the whule argument should come
out, than to seek to stifle it. It was himself
that opened the controversy, and he ought
not to desert it. ° ,

“ T do not believe that monarchy and aris~
tocracy will continue seven years longer in
any of the enlightened countries in Europe.
If better reasons can be shown for them than
against them, they will stand; if the con-
trary, they will not. Mankind are not now
to he told they shall not think, or they shalk
not read ; and publications that go no farther
than to investigate principles of government,
to invite men to reason and to reflect, and to
shew the errors and excellencies of different
systems, have aright to appear. If they do
not excite attention, they are not worth the
trouble of a prosecution; aud if they do, the
prosecution will amount to nothing, since it
cannot amount to a prohibition of reading.
This would be a sentence on the public, m-
stead of the author, and would also be the
ninst effectual mode of making or hastening
revolutions.

“ On all cases that apply universally to a
nation, With respect to systems of government,
a jury of twelve men is not competent to de-
cide. Where there are no witnesses to be ex-
amined, no facts to be proved, and where the
whole matter is before the whole public, and
the merits or demerits of it resting on their
opinion; and where there is nothing to be
known ina court, but what every body knows
out of it, every twelve men is equally as good
a jury as the other, and would most probably
reverse each other’s verdict; or from the va-
riety of their opinions, not be able to form one.
It is one case, whether the nation approve a
work, or aplan; but is quite another case,
whether it will commit to any such jury the

ower of determining whether that nation

ave a right to, or shall reform its government
or not. I mention those cases, that Mr.
Burke may see I have not written on govern-
ment without reflecting on what is law, as
well as on what are rights.—The only effectual
jury in such cases would be, a convention of
the whole nation fairly elected ; for in all such
cases the whole nation is the vicinage. If
Mr. Burke will propose such a jury, I will
wave all privileges of being the citizen of
another country, and, defending its principles,
abide the issue, provided he will do the same ;
for my opinion 1s, that his work and his prin-
ciples would be condemned instead of mine.

“As to the prejudices which men have
from education and habit, in favour of any
particular form or system of government, those
paspiices have yet to stand the test of reason
and reflection. In fact, such prejudices are no-
thing. No man is prejudiced in favour of a
thing, knowing it to be wrong. He is at-
tached to it on the belief of te tela right ;
and when he sees it is not so, the prejudice
will be gone. We have but a defective idea
of what prejudice is. It might be said, that
until nien think for themselves the whole is
prejudice, and not opinion; for that ouly is
Opinion which is the result of reason and re-
flection. I offer this remark, that Mr Burke
may not confide too much in what has been
the customary prejudices of the country.

“ TI do not believe that the people of Eng-
land have ever been fairly and candidly dealt
by. They have been imposed upon by parties,
and by men assuming the character of lead-
ers. It is time that the nation should rise
above those trifles. It is time to dismiss that
inattention which has so long been the en-
couraging cause of stretching taxation to ex-
cess. Itis time to dismiss all those songs
and toasts which are calculated to enslave,
and operate to suffocate reflection. On all
such subjects men have but to think, and they
will neither act wrong nor be misled. Tosay
that any people are not fit for freedom, is to
make poverty their choice, and to say they
had rather be loaded with taxes than not. If
such a case could be proved, it would equally
prove, that those who govern are not fit to
govern them, for they area part of the same
national mass,


“ But admitting governments to be changed
all over Europe; it certainly may be done
without convulsion or revenge. It is not
worth making changes or revolutions, unless
it be for some great national benefit; and
when this shall appear toa nation, the danger
will be, as in America and France, to those
who oppose ; and with this reflection I close
my preface.

_ “Tsomas Paine.
« London, Feb. 9, 1792.”

Mr. Garrow.—I had dismissed this book,
but the reading of the preface has reminded
me of some passages I had overlooked.

[The following passages were read.] -

(Page 161, 8vo. edition.)\—“ The fraud by-
pocrisy, and imposition of governments are
now beginning to be too well understood to
promise them any long career. The farce of
monarchy and aristocracy, in all countries is
following that of chivalry, and Mr. Burke is
dressing for the funeral. Let it then
quietly to the tomb of all other follies and the
mourners be comforted. :

“The time is not very distant when Eng-
land will laugh at itself for sending to Holland
Hanover, Zell, or Brunswick for men, at the
expense ofa million a year, who understood
neither her laws, her language, nor her in-
terest, and whose capacities would scarcely
have fitted them for the office of a parish con-
stable. If government could be trusted to
such hands, it must be some easy and simple
thing indeed, and materials fit for all the pur-
poses may be found in every town and Sillege
in England.”

(Page 161, 8vo. edition.)—‘‘ Within the
space of a few years we have seen two revolu-
tions, those of Americg.and France. In the
former, the contest was long, and the conflict
severe; in the latter, the nation acted with
sucha consolidated impulse, that having no
foreign enemy to contend with, the revolution
was complete in power the moment it ap-
peared. From both those instances it is evi-
dent, that the greatest forces that can be
brought into the feld of revolutions, are rea-
son and common interest. Where these can
have the opportunity of acting, opposition dies
with fear, or crumbles away by conviction. It
is a great standing which they have now uni-
versally obtained ; and we may hereafter hope
to see revolutions, or changes in governments
produced with the same quiet operation by
which any measure, determinable by reason
and discussion, is accomplished.

“When anation changes its opinion and
habits of thinking, it is no longer to be a
verned as before; but it would not only
wrong, but bad policy, to attempt by force
what ought to be accomplished by reason.
Rebellion consists in forcibl opposing the
general will of a nation whether by a party
orbyagovernment. There ought, therefore,
to be in every nation a method of occasionally

ascertaining the state of public opinion with
t to government. On this point the old
government of France was superior to the pre-
sent government of England, because, on ex-
inary occasions, recourse could be had
to what was then called the States-general.
Bat in England “there are no such occasional
bodies; and as to those who are now called
representatives, a great part of them are mere
machines of the court, placemen, and depen-
”

(Page 170, 8vo. edition—a note.)—“ I know
it is the opinion of many of the most enlight-
ened characters in France, (there always will
be those who see farther into events than
others) not only among the’ general mass of
citizens but of many of the principal mem-
bers of the former National Assembly,
that the monarchical plan will not continue
many years in that country. They have found
out, that as wisdom cannot be made hereditary,
powet ought not; and that, for a man to
merit a million sterling a year from a nation,
he ought to have a mind capable of compre-
hending from an atom to a universe; which,
ifhehad, he would be above receiving the
pay. But they wished not to appear to lead
the nation faster than its own reason and in-
terest dictated. In all the conversations where
Ihave been present upon this subject, the
idea always was, that when such a time, from
the general opinion of the nation, shall arrive,
that the honourable and liberal method would
be, to make a handsome present, in fee sim-
ple, to the person, whocver he may be, that
shall then be in the monarchical office, and
forhim to retire to the enjoyment of private
lite, possessing his share of general rights and
privileges, and to be no more accountable
to the public for his time and his conduct than
any other citizen.”

“Gentlemen ;—I have just published a
small treatise, in a letter to the National
Convention of France, on the defects of the
constitution of 1791, and the extent of the
amendments which ought to be applied. As
the true pouerce oF government are the
same in all countries, being founded on the
Rights of Man, which are universal and im-
prescriptible, I conceive the subject of this
treatise cannot be foreign to the great object
of your association, of which you have done
me the favour to make me an honorary mem-
ber; I, therefore, present a copy of it to you,
with the same confidence that I_ have done te
the National Convention, a confidence arising
from _a full conviction that the work is
founded in truth and reason, although these
principles seem not so immediately reducible
to practice in the government of this country
asin that of France, yet their examination
can never be unseasonable.

“ A great revolution in the management of
the affairs of nations, is, doubtless, soon to be
expected through all Europe; and, in the pro-
gress of mankind towards this attainment, it
Is greatly to bedesired that the convictions to
be squires from rational discussion, should

from physical exertion.

Mr. Joseph Johnson.—Examined by
Mr. Garrow.

T believe you are a bookseller in St. Paul's
Church Yard ?—I am.

And a publisher?—I am.

Be so good as look at that pamphlet which
you have in your hand, and tell me whether
that is of your publishing?—I really cannot
answer that question.

Do you know the person who appears to
be the author, Joel Barlow ?—Yes, I do.

It appears to be published by you, does it
not?—It does, I published such a pamphlet.

I am not asking you at present whether
these sheets of paper came out of your shop,
have the goodness to attend to the question,
you know Mr. Barlow you say ?—Yes, I do.

Did you publish for him at any time a
work with the title of that pamphlet.—I did.

Had you communication with him upon
the subject of that publication ?—I had.

Did you from him receive the manuscript?
—I think I did.

Have you any doubt of it?—Whether he
gave it to me or the printer I am not sure.

Who paid you for it?—The sale paid for it.

Be so good as look at it, and tell me whe-
ther you have any doubt that it was published
by you for Joel Barlow ?—I cannot recollect
the contents of pamphlets I publish.

{ suppose not, you publish a good many ?—
I believe it to be that.

Have you any doubt about it?—I cannot
say I have any doubt about it.

You publish a great many books, and you
do not always recollect the contents—did it
es to you to publish the Rights of Man?

611}

9.

Did you sell any ?—Yes.

How many copies—I do not ask you to
within a thousand,—but about how many do

- yqu think you sold ?—I cannot tell.

Did you sell many or few ?—I cannot tell
what you mean by many.

Did you sell some dozens ?—Certainly I did
—when that pamphlet was published it was
supposed not to be a lihel, afterwards it was
proved to be one. I beg to ask the Court
whether I am obliged to answer that ques-

tion?
Lord Chief Justice Eyre—It will not ex-
se you to any hazard to say whether you
appen to know how many copies were pub-
lished. The witness ought not to, be asked
how many he published himself. :
Mr. Garrow.—Do you know of your own
knowledge whether the sale of the book called
the Rights of Man was extensive or not? I
do not ask you whether you sold one yourself.
—Yes, I think I can say that the sale was large.
Do you recollect receiving any number of
a publication called a Letter to Mr. Dundas
from Mr. Paine?—I did not publish it.
T did not ask if you published it, or whe-
ther you distributed any of it, but whether
any certain rumer of copies of that publica-


tion were sent to you by any body—I will
assist your memory, were there not seven
hundred sent to you?—I think there were
some sent to me and forwarded into the
country—a parcel was sent to me to convey
to the coach, I believe.

Where from?—I do not know, but I sup-
pose, from the printer’s.

Do not you know of your own knowledge
by whose order they were sent, or from
whom they came?—No.

You said the sale of Mr. Barlow’s Letter
aid for the expense—what quantity might
e sold?—Perhaps five or six hundred—{

really do not know.

tional Convention of France, on the De-
fects of the Constitution of 1791, and the

of Advice to Privileged Orders."}

(From page 1, to the middle of page 12.)—
“ Gentlemen the time is at last arrived when
the people of France, by resorting to their
own proper dignity, feel themselves at liberty
to exercise their unembarrassed reason, in
establishing an equal government. The
present crisis in your affairs, marked by
the assembling of a National Convention,
bears nearly the same relation to the last
four years of your history, as your whole
revolution bears to the great accumulated
mass of modern improvement; compared,
therefore, with all that is past, it is perhaps
the most interesting portion of the most im-
portant period that Europe has hitherto seen.

“Under this impression, and with the
deepest sense of the magnitude of the subject
which engages your attention, I take a liberty
which no “i ht motives could warrant ina
stranger, the liberty of offering a few obser-
vations on the business that lies before you.
Could I suppose, however, that any apology
were necessary for this intrusion, I should not
rely upon the one here mentioned, but my
intentions require no apology; I demand to
be heard, as aright. Your cause is that of
human nature at large ; you are the represen-
tatives of mankind; and though I am not
literally one of your constituents, yet I must
be bound by your decrees. My pines
will be seriously affected by your delibera-
tions; and in them I have an interest, which.
nothing can destroy. I not only consider all
mankind as forming but one great family,
and therefore hound by a natural sympathy
to regard each other's peptone as making
part of their own; but I contemplate the
French nation at this moment as standing in
the place of the whole, you have stepped for-
ward with a gigantic stride to an enterprise
which involves the interests of every sur-
rounding nation; and what you began as
justice to yourselves, you are called upon ta
finish as a duty to the human race.

“T believe no man cherishes s greater
veneration than I have uniformly done, for.

the Nationaf Assembly who framed that con-
stitution, which I now presume your consti-
tuents expect you to revise. Perhaps the
merits of that body of men will never
be properly apprectated. The greatest
part of their exertions were necessarily
spent on objects which cannot be de-
Scribed; and which from their nature can
meake no figure in history. The enormous
weight of abuses they had to overturn, the
quantity of pee with which their fune+
tions called them to contend, as well in their
own minds as in those of all the European
world, the open opposition of interests, the
secret weapons of corruption, and the un-
bridied fury of despairing faction—these are
subjects bik escape our common observa-
tion, when we contemplate the labours of
that assembly. But the legacy they have
left to their country in their deliberative ca-
pacity will remain a lasting monument to
their praise; and though while searching out
the defective parts of their work, without
losing sight of the difficulties under which it
was formed, we may find more occasion to
admire its wisdom, than to murmur at its
faults; yet this consideration ought not to
deter us from the attempt.

“The great leading principle, on which
their constitution was meant to be founded,
is the equality of rights. This principle bein;
laid down withsuch clearness, and asserted wit
so much dignity in the beginning of the code,
it is strange that men of clear understandings
should fail to be charmed with the beauty of
the system which nature must have taught
them to build on that foundation. It shows
a disposition to counteract the analogy of
nature, to see them at one moment impress-
ing this indelible principle on our minds and

with the next breath declaring, that France |

shall remain a monarchy, that it shall have a
king, hereditary, inviolable, clothed with all
the executive, and much of the legislative

ywer, commander in chief of all the national

ree by land and sea, having the initiative of
war, and the power of concluding peace ;—
and above all, to hear them declare that,
£ The nation will provide for the splendour of
‘the throne,’ granting in their legislative
capacity to that throne more than a million
sterling a year, from the national purse, be-
sides the rents of estates which are said to
amount to half as much more.

“ We must be astonished at the paradoxical
Organization of the minds of men who could
see no discordance in these ideas, they begin
with the open simplicity of a rational republic,
and immediately plunge into all the labyrinths
of royalty; and 4 great part of the constitu-
tional code is a practical attempt to reconcile
these two discordant theories It is a perpe-
tual conflict between principle and precedent,
between the manly truths of nature, which
we all must feel, and the learned subtilties of
Statesmen, about which we have been taught
fo reason.



| _“ In reviewing the history of lumen opi
| mions, it is an unpleasant consideration to
remark how slow the mind has alwavs beem
in seizing the most’ interesting truths; al«
though, when discovered, they appear to have
been the most obvious.
where verified with more circumstances of
regret, than in the progress of vour ideas im

France relative to the inutility of the kingly
| office. It was not enough that you too
your first stand upon the high ground of
natural right; where, enlightened hy the sus
of reason, you might have seen the clouds of
prejudice roll far beneath your feet, it was
not enough: that you began by considering
royalty, with its well known scourges as being
the cause of all your evils, that the kings of
modern Europe are the authors of war and
misery, that their mutual intercourse is s
commerce of human slaughter—that public
debts and private oppressions, with ‘all the
degrading vices that tarnish the face of nature,
had their origin in that species of government
which offers a premium for wickedness, and
teaches the few to trample on the many; it
was not enough that you saw the means ofa
regeneration of mankind in the system of
equal rights, and that in a wealthy and pow-
erful nation you possessed the advantage of
reducing that system to immediate practice
asan example to the world, and a consolation
to human nature. All these arguments,
with a variety of others, which your repub-
lican orators placed in the strongest point of
| light, were insufficient to raise the public
mind to a proper view of the subject.

“It seems that some of your own philoso»
phers had previously taught, that royalty was
Necessary to a great nation. Montesquieu,
among his whimsieal maxims about laws and
: government, had informed the world thata
i limited monarchy was the best possible system,
'and that a democracy could never flourish
; but in a small tract of country. How many
of your legislators believed in this doctrine ;
how many acted from temporising motives,
wishing to banish royalty by slow degrees;
and how many were led by principles less
pardonable than either, it is impossible to
determine. Certain it is, that republican ideas
gained no ground upon the monarchical in
. your constituting assembly, during the last
, 8ix months of their deliberations. It is like-
| wise certain, that the majority of thatassembly
‘took much pains to prevent the people from
' discovering the cheat of royalty, and to con-

tinue their ancient veneration, at least for a
| while, in favour of certain principles in gos
vernment, which reason could not approve,

“It is remarkable, that all the perfidy of

our king, at the time of his flight, should
ave had so little effect in opening the eyes
of so enlightened a people as the French,
His flight, and the insulting declaration which
he left behind him, were sufficient not onl:
to give the lie to the fiction, with whic!
common sense has always been put to the

This renark isno | ~

blush, and t6 which your assembly had et-
tempted to give a sanction, That Kingscan do
no wrong; but they weré sufficient to show,
at least to all who would open their eyes, that
the business of government required no such
officer. There is no period, during your revo-
lution, if there is any to be found in the his-
tory of France, when business went on with
morg alacrity and good order, than during the
suspension of the reyal functions, in the in-
terval, from the time that the king was
brought back to the capital, m June, tll the
Completion of the constitution in September.
Every: thing went right in the kingdom, ex-
cept within the walls of the assembly. A
majority of that body was determined to make
an riment. of a limited monarchy. The
e ment has been made. Its duration has,
indeed, been short, being less than eleven
months; but, although in some respects it
has been almostas fatal to the cause of liberty
as any system could have been within the
time, yet in other respects, it has done more
good t

sophers of the age could have done in a much
longer time: it has taught them a new doc-
trine, which no experience can shake, and
which reason must confirm, That Kings can
do no good.”

(oops 14 and part of 15).—“ Among the
probable evils resulting from the kingly office,
the principal one, and indeed the only one
that need to be mentioned, is the chance of
its being held by a weak or a wicked man.
When the office is hereditary, it is scarcely to
be expected but thas this should always be the
case. Considering the birth and education of
princes, the chance of finding one with practi-
cal common sense, is hardly to be reckoned
among possible events; nor is the probability
Jess strong against their having virtue. The
temptations to wickedness arising from their
situation, are too povertul to beresisted. The
persuasive arts of all their flatterers, the com-
panions of their youth, the ministers of their
pleasures, and every person with whom they
ever converse, are necessarily employed to in-
duce them to increase their revenue, by op-
pressing the people, whom they are taught from
their cradle, to consider as beasts of burthen ;
and what must almost insure the triumph of
wickedness in their tempers, is, the idea that
they act totally and tor ever without restraint.
This is an allurement to vice, that even men
of sense could scarcely resist. Impress it on

, the mind of any man, that he can do no wrong,
and he will soon convince you of your mis-

e.

“Take this general summary of the evils
arising from hereditary monarchy, under any
restrictions that can be proposed, and place it
on one side of the account, and state, on the
other side, the. truth which I believe no man
of reflection will hereafter call in question,
That Kings can do no good, and the friends of
Hiberty will no longer be in doubt which way
you will decide the question -elative to that
part of your constitution

an _all the reasonings of all the philo- |.


(Page 22 to 26).—“ But it-wil be said, F am
too late, with all these observations, on the
necessity of proscribing royalty from your
constitution. The cause is already judged in
the minds of the whole people of France; and
their wishes will surely be the rule of your
conduct. I suppose that, without being re-
tmainded of your duty by a stranger, one of your
first resolutions would be, to fix a national
anathema on every vestige of regal power,
and endeavour to wipe out from the human
character the stain which it received with its
veneration for kings and hereditary claims.
But it requires much reflection, to be well
aware to what extent this duty should carry
you. There are many vices in your constitu-
tion, which though not apparently connected
with the king, had their eae in regal ideas.
To purify the whole code from these vices,
and to purge human nature from their effects,
it will be necessary to resort to many princi-
ples which appear not to have struck the
minds of the first assembly.

* You will permit me to hint at some of the
great outlines of what may be expected from
you under the peculiar advantages with which,
you meet to form a glorious republic. Ab
though many of my ideas may be perfectly
superfluous, Sane the same as will occur to
every member of your body, yet it is possible
that some of them may strike the mind in a
new point of Jight, and lead to reflections
which would not rise from any other quarter.
Should this be the casein the sinallest degree,
it ought to be considered, both by you and
me, as an ample reward for our pains in writ-
ing and in reading this letter. .

“ On considering the subjectof government,
when the mind is once set loose from the
shackles of royalty, it finds itself in a new
world: it rises toa more extensive view of
every circumstance of the social state. Hu-
man nature assumes a new and more elevated
shape, and displays many moral features,
which, from having been always disguised,
were not known to exist. In this case, it is
a long time before we acquire a habit of trae-
ing effects to their proper causes, and of ap-
plying the easy and simple remedy to those
vices of our nature which society requires us
to restrain. This, I apprehend, is the source
of by far the greatest difficulties with which
you have to contend. We are so much used,
in government, to the most complicated sys-
tems, as being necessary to support those im-
Positions, erat oUt which it has been supposed
impossible for men to be governed, that it is
an unusual task to conceive of the simplicity
to which the business of government may be
reduced, and to which it must be reduced, if
we would have it answer the purpose of pro-
moting happiness. ; _

“ After presnling royalty, with all its ap-
pendages, I suppose it will not be thought ne-
cessary in France to support any other errors
and superstitions of a similar complexion ; but
that undisguised reason, in all things, will be

preferred to the cloak.of imposition. Should
this be the case, you will conceive it no lon-

er necessary to maintain a national church.

"his establishment is so manifestly an impo-
sition upon the judgment of mankind, that
the sopiiuting assembly must have consi-
dered it in that light. It is one of those mo-
narchical ideas, which pay -us.the wretched
compliment of supposing, that we are not
capable of being perenne by our own reason.
To suppose that the people of France are to
learn the mode of worshipping ‘God from the
decrees of the council of Trent, is certainly as
absurd as it would ‘be to appeal to such a
council, to learn how to breathe, or to open
their eyes. Neither is it true, as is argued by
the advocates of this part of your constitution,
that the preference there given to one mode
of worship, by the payment of the Catholic
priests from the national purse, to the exclu-
sion of others, was ‘founded on the idea of the
property supposed to ‘have been possessed by
that church, and which, by the assembly, was
declared to be thenceforward the property of
the nation.

“The church, in this sense of the word,
signifies nothing but @ mode of worship ; and
to prove that a mode can he a proprietor of
lands, requires a subtility of logic that I shall
not attempt torefute. The fact is, the church,
considered as.an hierarchy, was always neces-
sary to the support of royalty; and your as-
sembly, with great consistency of design,
wishing to preserve something of the old-fa-
bric, preserved something of this necessar
prop. But as the fabric is now overturned,
the prop may be safely taken away. I am
confident that monarchy and hierarchy will be
buried in the same grave, and that in Trance
they will not survive the present year.”

(Page-$1,)—“ After laying down the great
fundamental principle, thatak men are equal
tn their rights, it ought to be the invariable
object of the social compact to insure the
exercise of that equality, by rendering them
as ena in all sorts of enjoyments, as can
possibly be consistent with good order, indus-
try, and the reward of merit. Every indivi-
dual ought to he rendered as independent of
every other individual as possible; and, atthe
same time, as dependent as possible on the
whole community.

“ On this siwieniable maxim, I think-the
following positions ought to be founded and

guaranteed in the constitutional code :”——

Mr. Tauzun.—I found this letter in Mr.
Hardy’s house among his other papers.

[It was read.]
“To the London Corresponding Society.

** Gentlemen ;—I have lately published a
small treatise under the title of ‘A Letter to
6 the National Convention of France,’on the
‘Defects in the constitution of 1791, and the
* extent of the Amendments which ought to
‘beapplied.’ Although the observations con-


tained in this letter are more particular -
plicable:to the French nation in the nie
crisis of its government, yet, as the true prin-
ciples of society are every where the same,
their examination cannot be unseasonable ia
any nation-or atany time. Believing, there-
fore, that-the subject of this treatise will not
be thought foreign to the great object of your
association, I present a copy of it to you, with
the same confidence as f have done to the

National Convention, .and to the Constitu-

tional Society in London: a confidence arising

from the full persuasion.that the work ‘is

founded in truth and reason. d
“T takethe liberty at the same time to send

you a copy of another publication, : intituled,

* Advice to the Privileged Ordere.’

« The present disposition in Kurope towards
a general revolution in the prineiple of govern-
ment, is founded in a.current of opinion too
secon to be resisted, as well as too sacred to

e treated with neglect. It is the duty of every
individual to assist, not only in removing the
obstructions that are found in the way of this
revolution, but in ascertaining with as much
precision as possible the nature of the object
to be aimed at, and the consequences to be
expected from the attainment. It is above
all things to he desired that-the convictions to
be acquired from rational discussion, should
precede and preclude those which must result
from physical exertion. ‘

* Such, 1 believe, is the object of your so-
ciety, and such is certainly that of your friend
and servant, Jost Bartow.”

“ London, Oct. 6th, 1792.

Addressed “To the London Cor-
responding Society, care of Mr.
ThomasHardy, No.9 Piccadilly.”’

Mr. Garrow to Mr. Johnson —Who was the
author of this pamphlet, which appears to
have been published by you, intituled “ Ad-
vice to the Privileged Orders ?”"—I published a

amphlet with that title tor Mr. Barlow: I
believe this is it.

Do you know whether he was the sole au-
thor of it, or were there any other persons:
concerned in it?—I cannot tell; but I really
believe he was the sole author.

Which you published in the same way, I
suppose, as you did the other—Had it a large
sale ?—Not a very arge sale ; not many more
than a thousand, I believe.

{Extracts read from “ Advice to the Privi-
leged Orders of the several States of Europe,
resulting from the Necessity and Propriety of
aGeneral Revolution in the Principles of Go-
vernment, Part I. the Third Edition, by Joel
Barlow.”}

(From page 17 to page 20).—“ Mr. Burke,
however, in his detence of royalty, does not
rely on this argument of the compact. Whe-
ther it be that he is conscious of its futility,
-or that in his rage he forgets that he has use
it, he is perpetually securing to the lass

ground that has yet been heard of on which
we are called upon to consider kings, even as
& tolerable nuisance, and to support the exist-
jog forms of government; this ground is the
encral goud of the community. It is said to
dangerous to pull down systems that are
already turmed, or even to attempt to im-
prove them; and it is likewise said, that,
were they peaceably destroyed, and we had
society to build-up anew, it would be best to
create hereditary kings, hereditary orders, and
exclusive privileges.

“ These are sober opinions, uniting a class
of reasoners too numerous and too respect-
able to be treated with contempt. I believe,
however, that their number is every day di-
minishing ; and I believe the example which
France will soon be obliged to exhibit to the
world on this subject, will induce every man
to reject them who is not personally and ex-
clusively interested in their support.

“ The inconsistency of the Constituent As-
sembly, in retaining an hereditary king, armed
with an enormous civil list, to wage war with
a@ popular government, has induced some per-
sons to predict the downfall of their constitu-
tion ; but this measure had a different origin

from what is commonly assigned to it, and |:

will probably have a different issue; it was
the result rather of local and temporary cir-
cumstances, than of any general belief in the
utility of kings, under any modifications or
limitations that could be attached to the
office.

* It is to be observed, first, that the French
had a king upon their hands: this king had
always been considered as a well-disposed
man; so that, by a fatality somewhat singular,
though not unexampled in regal history, he
gained the love of the people almost in pro-
portion to the mischief which he did them.

condly, their king had very powerful family
connexions in the sovereigns of Spain, Aus-
tria, Naples, and Sardinia, besides his relations
within the kingdom, whom it was necessary
to attach, if possible, to the interests of the
community. Thirdly, the Revolution was
considered by all Europe as a high and dan-
gerous experiment; it was necessary to hide,
as much as possible, the appearance of its
Magnitude frum the eye of the distant ob-
server, The reformers considered it as their
duty to produce an internal regeneration of
society, ratier than an external change in the
appearance of the court; to set in order the
counting-house and the kitchen, before ar-
ranging the drawing-room. This would leave
the savereigns of Europe totally without a
pretext for interfering, while it would be
consoling to that class of philosophers who
still believed in the compatibility of royalty
and liberty. Fourthly, this decree that France
should huve a king, and that he could do no
wrong, was passed at an early period of their
operations, when the above reasons were ap-
parently more urgent than they were after-

wards, or probably will ever be again.


“From these considerations we may can
clude that royalty ts preserved in France for
reasons which are fugitive; that a majority of
the Constituent Assembly did not believe in
it as an abstract principle; that a majority of
the people will learn to be disgusted with so
unnatural and ponderous a deformity in their
new edifice, and will soon hew it off.

“ After this improvement shall bave been
made, a few years experience in the face of
Europe, and on so great a theatre as that of
France, will probably leave but one opinion,
in the minds of honest men, relative to the
republican principle, or the great simplicity of
nature, applied to the organization of society.”

(Page 21 )—* It depends on a much more
important class of meu, the class that cannot
write, and in a great measure on those who
cannot read ; it is to be decided by men who
reason better without books, than we do with
all the books in the world: taking it for
granted, therefore, that a general revolution is
at hand, whose progress is irresistible, my ob-
ject is to contemplate its probable effects, and
to comfort those who are afflicted at the
prospect.”

Mr. Garrow to Mr. Johnson.---Did you pub-
lish the former editions of this work ?—I did.
Perhaps you mean that the sale of each
edition was not more than you mentioned ?—
There were three editions, five hundred each
een, and there were a considerable number
eft.

Was this first published before the death of
the late king of the French, or not?

Mr. Juhason.--- W hatis the date in the title-
page?

Mr. Garrow.—-This is the third edition—Do
you know whether this was published before,
or after that event?—I cannot tell; I think it
was published in 1792, or 1791.

Mr, Garrow to Mr. Johnson.—-Be so good
as look at that pamphlet: it is called “A
Letter to the Addressers, by Thomas Paine.”
Do you know whether any pamphlet of that
sort was published by Thomas Paine ?—Cer-
tainly there was.

Do you believe this to be one of the copies
that were so published ?—I believe it is.

I do not know whether you know any thing
of the cheap edition or not; do you know
how soon the cheap edition came out alter the
first edition ?—No.

y Have you seen any of the cheap edition ?-—-
es.

Do you know whether that was published
about the same tine ?—It was published after
the large edition; I do not know how long.

Look at that copy of the cheap edition, and
say whether you believe that to be one of the
copies that were published?—I cangot say,
because any printer may copy this.

Mr. Erskine -~lJo you mean to swear that
the large edition is; that either is?—No. I
only believe it from the appearance of it; any
pruntes may copy it, mg. .

. Mr. Siaseast Typ have already said, that

‘ou believe that to be one of the copies of the

large edition which was published by Mr.
Paine ?—It has all the appearance of it; any
printer may take a fac simile copy of it.

Upon looking at it, do you believe it to be
one, or have you any doubt on the subject ?—
I cannot positively say; @ printer may print
a fac simile of it.

Do you believe that to have been printed
by a printer making a fac simile without au-
thority, or to be one of the original ‘edition?
I ask you upon your oath.—I cannot say, be-
cause a printer can make a fac simile.

, Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Unless he can
speak from the type, or the intrinsic circum-
stances, it is nothing.—I really cannot so
speak.

Mr. Garrow.—Whom does that appear in
the title-page to be printed by ?—Symonds,

Is there any other person named as the
publisher ?—And Clio Rickman.

Had you communications with the author
upon the subject of an edition of the Address
to-the Addressers?—I beg leave to address
the Court.—My lord, this publication hae
been deemed a if

Mr. Garrow.-—I am not asking the witness
whether he published or gold any of them, or
whether he lent any one, but whether he had
any communication with the author upon the
subject?—The author printed it, to the best
of my knowledge, when I was in the country ;
I was at Margate, I believe, at the time when
he printed this pamphlet.

Lord Chief Justice Byre.—Hitherto I do

“ Frenchmen !|—While foreign robbers are
ravaging your territories, under the specious
retext of justice; cruelty and desolation
leading on their van, perfidy with treache'
bringing up their rear, yet mercy and friend-
ship impudentiy held forth to the world as
the sole motives of their incursions, the op-
pressed part of mankind forgetting, for awhile,
their own sufferings, feel only for yours, and
with an anxious eye watch the event, fere
vently supplicating the Almighty Ruler of the
Universe to be favourable to your cause, so
intimately blended with their own. ’
“ Frowned upon by an oppressive system
of control, whose gradual, but continued en
croachments, have deprived this nation of
nearly all its boasted liberty, and brought us
almost to that abject state of slavery, frone
which you have so emerged, 5,000 British
citizens, indignant, manfully step forth to
rescue their country from the opprobrium
brought upon it, by the supine conduct of
those in power. They conceive it to be the
duty of Britons to countenance and assist, to
the utmost of their power, the champions of
human happiness, and to swear to a nation,
proceeding on the plan you have adopted, aa
inviolable friendship. ed from this day
be that friendship between us ! And may ver-
geance to the uttermost, évertake the man
who hereafter shall attempt to cause a rupture.
“ Though we appear so few at present, be
assured, Frenchmen, that our mumber in«
creases daily ; it is true, that the stern up-
lifted arm of authority at present keeps back
the timid, that busily circulated impostors
hourly mislead the credulous, and that court
intimacy, with avowed French traitors, has
some effect on the unwary, and op the any
bitions. But, with certainty, we can inform
you, friends and freemen, that information
makes a rapid progress among us. Curiosity
has taken possession of the public mind; the
conjoint reign of ignorance and despotism
asses away. Men now ask each other, what
is freedom? what are our rights? Frenchmen,
you are already free, and Britons are preparing

to become so !
“ Casting far from us the criminal preju-
dices artfully inaulcated by evil-minded men,

and wily courtiers; we, mstead of natural
enemies, at length discover in Frenchmen,
our fellow citizens of the world, and our
brethren by the same Heavenly Father, who
created us for the purpose of loving and mu-
tually assisting each other; but not to hate,
and to be ever ready to cut each others throats,
at the command of weak or ambitious kings,
and corrupt ministers.

“Seeking our real enemies, we find them
in our bosoms; we feel ourselves inwardly
torn by, and ever the victims of @ restless,
all-consuming aristocracy, hitherto the bane
of every nation under the sun! Wisely have
you acted in expelling it from France.

“ Warm as are our wishes for your success,
eager as we are to behold freedom triumphant,
and man every where restored to the enjoy-
ment of his just rights,.a sense of our duty, as
orderly citizens, forbids our flying in arms to
your assistance; our government has pledged
the national faith to remain neutral:—in a
struggle of liberty against despotism, Britons
remain neutral! O shame! But we have
entrusted our king with discretionary powers;
—we therefore must obey ;—our hands are
bound, but our hearts are free, and they are
awith you.

We shall rejoice at their fall, compassionating

Barlow’s letter to this society in the papers.

“ Sir;—your manly and energetic address
tothe National Convention in France, having
been received by the Society for Constitu-
tional Information, and read at their last
meeting, they cannot hesitate to return yoa
their unanimous thanks for su valuable a pre-
sent, and to express in the warmest terms
their hearty approbation of its spirit and tes-
dency: your little treatise, by exhibiting the
most important political truths in a new and
striking-point of view, is, in their opinion,
happily -calculated to inform the inquiring
mind, and to inspire an ardent and enlighten-

means of reinstating, in the full enjoyment of | ed zeal for the freedum and happiness of

their rights and liberties, millions of our fel-
dow creatures.

“ With unconcern, therefore, we view the
elector of Hanover join his troops to traitors
and robbers; but the king of Great Britain
will do well to remember, that this country is

tion, we will not. .

ing the unaided defenders of freedom, we

the public voice will concur, when the pam-
pile shall have obtained that general circu-
ation to which its merits entitle it.

“ It is with reason that you think the sub-

| ject of your book not foreign to the t ob-
ject of the society, which has invariably been,
to lead their countrymen to think for them-
selves on the momentous subject of govern-
ment, and thus to produce an universal and

fondly anticipate, in idea, the numerous bles- | practical conviction of one great truth, that

without a real representation of the people,

we ardently wish, the triple alliance (not of | frequently renewed, there can be no ettectusl

peace to the whole world. Dear friends, you
combat for the advantage of the human race.
How well purchased will be, though: at the
expense of much blood, the glorious, the un-
prsecdenyed privilege of saying, maukind is
ree! Tyrants and tyranny are no more!
Peace reigns on the earth! And this is the
work of Frenchmen.”

“ Resolved ;—That the thanks of this so-
ciety be given to the London Corresponding

them; and that the secretary acquaint them,

revolution has arrived at that point of perféc-
tion which will permit us to address you by
this title; it is the only one that can accord
with the character of true legislators. Every
successive epoch in your affairs, has added
something to the triumphs of liberty; and
the glorious victory of the 10th of August, has
fi prepared the way for a constitution,
which we trust you will establish on the basis
of reason and nature. .

‘ « Considering the mass of delusion accu+
mulated on mankind, to obscure their under-
standings, you cannot be astonished at the
opposition you have met both from tyrants
and from slaves. The instrument used
against you by each of these classes is the
same; for in the genealogy of human mise-
ries, ignorance is at once the parent of oppres-
sion, and the child of submission. _

“The events of every day are proving, that
your cause is cherished by the people in all
your continental vicinity; that a majority of
each of those nations are your real friends,
whose governments have tutored them into
apparent foes, and that they only wait to be
delivered by your arms from the dreaded
necessity of fighting against them.

* The condition of Englishmen is less to be
deplored—here the hand of oppression has not
yet ventured completely to ravish the pen
from us, nor openly to point the sword at you.
From bosoms burning with ardour in your
cause, we tender you our warmest wishes for
the full extent of its progress and success. It
is indeed a sacred cause ; we cherish it as the
pledge of your happiness, our natural and
nearest friends; and we rely upon it as the
bond of fraternal union to the human race, in
which union our own nation will surely be one
of the first to concur.

“ Our government has still the power, and
perhaps the inclination, to employ hirelings
to cuntradict us; but it is our real opinion,
that we now speak the sentiments of a great
majority of the English nation.---The people
here are wearied with imposture, and worn
out with war; they have learned to reflect,
that both the one and the other are the off-
spring of unnatural combinations in society as
relative to systems of government, not the
result of the natural temper of nations, as re-
lative to each others happiness. .

* Go on, legislators, in the work of human
happiness— the benefits will in part be ours,
but the glory shall be all your own It is the
reward of your perseverance, it is the prize of
virtue. The sparks of liberty preserved in
England for ages like the coruscations of
the noi aurora, served but to show the
darkness visible in the rest of Europe. The
lustre of the American republic, like an efful-

ent morning, rose with increasing vigour,

ut still too distant to enlighten our hemis-
phere, till the splendour of the French revolu-
tion burst forth upon the nations, in the full
fetvour of a meridian sun, and displayed in
@he midst of the European world, the prac-


tical result of principles which philosophy had
sought in the shade of speculation, and which
experience inust every where confirm. It
dispels the clouds of prejudice from all people,
reveals the secrets of all despotism, and cre-
ates a new character in man. e

“ In this career of improvement, your ex-
ample will be soon followed; for nations
rising from their lethargy, will reclaim the
rights of man, with a voice which man cannot
resist.

the labours of alg men, by securing the
happiness of their fellow creatures.

“ Innumerable societies of a similar nature
are now forming in every part of England,
Scotland, and Ireland. They excite a spirit
of universal inquiry into the complicated
abuses of government, and the simple means
of reform. .

.“ After the example which France has
fren, the science of revolutions will be ren-

cited your solicitude, The defenders of our

You command our esteem, you will

through the world will never forget their ob-
ligations to the English nation.

“ The shades of Pym, of Hampden, and of
Sydney, are hovering over your heads ; and.
the moment cannot be distant, when the
people of France will offer their congratula-
tions to a national convention in England.
Too long has the torch of discord enflamed

ad- | the English and the French; while the am-

bition of kings, fomenting national aversions,
compelled them -to forget, that nature has

“ Your islands, it is said, were severed
from the continent by a great convulsion of

two shores of the narrow sea which divides
us, will repair the breach, and restore the
two nations to the harmony and friendship
for which nature has designed them. Rea- -

« Yes, citizens, our brethren and friends,

the 10th of August, 1792, shall be distin-
guished in the annals of the world as the day
of the triumph of liberty.
. “ Our first revolution did but show to us
the salutary principles of the imprescriptible
i of man: except the unprincipled,
and the enemies of humanity, adopted them
with enthusiasm. It was then that we
formed ourselves into a society, in order the
better to impress them upon ourselves, and
afterwards.to teach them to our fellow-
citizens.


“Our first. constitution had consecrated
them, but had not always taken them for its
base. The dominion of the passions, the
force of habit, the impression of prejudices,
and the power of the intrigues employed in
our Constituent Assembly, found the secret to
preserve sufficient authority to our tyrants,
to extinguish, at some time, the sacred rights
of nature, and to re-establish despotism on
its throne of iron.

“ But royalty, thus preserved, was not con-
tent with the victory that had secured to it
the greatest number of the corrupt persons
who surrounded it. It was impatient to rea
the fruits that it appeared to promise iteelk
But its too great eagerness has hastened its
ruin, and secured the triumph of reason.

“The French, proud of their new exis-
tence, soon perceived the fault of their first
legislators, became sensible of the imperfec-
tion of its first laws—saw that they made a
surrender of the rights of liberty and equality
which they had embraced, they roused them-
selves anew to demand, at length, laws im-
partial and humane.

“From thence the necessary day of the
tenth of August 1792. From thence a se-
cond revolution, but a revolution which is
only the completion of the first, which has
received our vows and our oaths, and which
we will bless for ever, if it leads us, as we
hope it will, to the happiness of the nation,
to the constant maintenance of liberty and
equality.

“ Let intriguers, tools, and tyrants calum-
niate us; we despise them too much to con-
descend to answer them, and seek for their
esteem.

“That which flatters us, is, the interest
that you take in our labours, your attention
to contribute to the success of our arms;
we desire your esteem, we are proud of your
approbation. *

“ We smile at the expression of the senti-
ments that you manifested to our representa-
tives: we behold a nation of brethren rouse
itself to support the cause of humanity: we
behold the brave English adopt our princi-
ples, become our friends ; we say to ourselves
with pleasure, soon will they become our
allies, and, uniting our efforts, we shall go on
to deliver the universe from the yoke of
tyrants—to restore the nations to reason and
nature.

“That day is not far distant, if we may
rely on our own courage, and the hope of your
alliance.

“ Inthe mean time receive our thanks, and
correspond with brethren who set a high
value upon your esteem. ; :

“ Paris, September 20th, 1792.

“ My dear Sir ;—We arrived safe at this
place yesterday to dinner; and, having met
with no interruption on ourjourney, by night
or by day, since we left Dover, except delay
at Abbeville, Amiens, Clermont, and for want
of horses, which the emigrants have wore
out. Paris is now quiet, though it was illu-
minated, and the guards under arms from an
apprehension of the people visiting the Tem-
4 le to destroy Louis and his wife: the latter

raves it, and will to the last; the former is
insensible to his fate. The night, however,
peste over in silence; and this evening the

onvention will meet, and the National As-
sembly take their leave. About three hun-
dred of the present assembly are returned to
the Convention; the rest retire with execra-
tions. Mr. Paine made his appearance in the
National Assembly last night, which excited
great curiosity among both men and women,
and occasioned no small interruption. The
first who embraced him was Cambon, who
last night made a most excellent speech on
the subject of the jewels, plate, &c. found in
the churches, &c. in order to have them
melted, as hitherto most infamous use had
been made of them, by pawning them to the
Jews, &c. to raise money for the emigrants.
This motion was become the more necessary,
as, a few nights ago, that is, on the morning
of Tuesday, 40 men armed, entered the Thuil-
leries, and carried off 30 millions of livres.
The gates of Paris have been shut, and a
search made: more than a million has been
found. The treachery of Louis is so great,
that the indignation of the people cannot be
wondered at. He has anticipated the civil
list a year and a half, and mortgaged his do-
mains for six years. The bankers, and others
who have advanced the money, will be ruined.
Byde is gone. I will inform myself, between
this and Monday, of every thing that is pass-
ing, and by that post send you a particular
account of the 10th, the truth of which is not
yet known in England, or, if known, con-
cealed or misrepresented to blacken the revo-
lution. Without the affair of the 10th, liberty
was over. Iam sorry to learn that the con-
duct of your friend gen. M. is not well
spoken of. He was in the Thuilleries all
night of the 9th; and he and captain Samp-
son left about eight o’clock in the morning ;
and there is no doubt but he regulated the
troops, and disposed them in order to attack.
Hig conduct was winked at, out of respect to
the English. He is now with Dumourier’s
army, which ig 80,000 strong; and it is ex-


pected that an account will arrive this day of
an engagement between him and the Prus-
sians, as general Kellerman had, by a forced
march over the mountains, joined him when
he last wrote; within nine miles of which,
the Prussians being informed of his approach,
made an attack before the junction, and was
repulsed. There are 500,000 troops now
upon the frontiers, The language of the
king of P is cl from that of
threats to soothing; and he has artfully en-
deavoured to persuade the troops, that, as
they are unable to defend themselves, and are
betrayed by their generals, they had better
lay down their arms. Few Prussian deserters
have come over; but a great number of Aus-
trians have entered. have this moment
read a letter from general Money, who ex-
pects every moment the attack of the Prus-
sians. They have been joined by a t
body of Brabanters, who have all along fought
with uncommon bravery. The post 1s going
out, and compels me to hasten to a conclu-
sion. We dine to-day with Pethion. Paine
has entered his name on the roll of parlis-
ment, and went through the forms of office
with a great deal of nonchalance. We are
well lodged, and, besides our bed-rooms, have
an entertaining room for members to be
shown into: several have called this morn
ing. We are to give ten livres a day. The
clerk of parliament has this moment been
here—Mr. Rose, a relation of the notorious
George Rose, 1 have nothing more to add,
but that Mr. Paine is in good spirits ; aud in-
deed the flattering reception he has met with
all through France, could not failof it. It is
more than I describe. [ believe he is rather
fatigued with the kissing. Pethion still re-
tains his popularity. Robespierre has been
attacked in the primary assembly, and told
that he was the most dangerous man in
France, and that a good citizen ought to blow
his brains out. The English, I understand,
showed great pusillanimity. Tell Vaughan,
his friend Losh was, for three or four days
before he left the hotel, very uneasy, and
thought he should never see England again.
Mr. Watt is here, and very civil. « What is

Addressed, “ John Horne Tooke, esq.””

Mr. Garrow.—Now I will give some ‘ac-
count of what these transactions of the 10th
of August were, which are stated as neces-
sary to liberty.

Mr. Garrow to Mr. Huskisson.—Were you
i: Paris op the 10th of August, 1792?—Yes,

was,
I believe you resided in the house of the
oe salons lord Gower ?—I did.
you been in Paris any time previous
to the 10th of August’—From the month of
July, 1790, .
so good as to state shortly, what the
facts were, which are described as the trans-

actions of the 10th of August, as they relate
to transactions at Paris and Versailles, as they
fell under observation.—On the 10th of
August I iad on opportunity of observing
very little, ae I did net go out durmg the con-
test that took place in the course of that
morning. .

What was the nature of that which you
describe as a contest, which kept you at
home?—I heard a firing, and I saw smoke. I
saw afterwards sume of the out-buildings on
fire at the 3 and I saw people running
with their arms towards that part of the town.

What did you find had occasioned the
firing; from what had it ded, the firing
of and the firing the buildings?—The
firing of arms, I understood, ‘posers from
persons who wished to enter the palace, and
also from those who opposed their entrance.

Was the palace, at that time, the residence
of the king and his family ?—I believe it was.

Can you describe any other transactions of
that day, which came within your knowled;
at the moment, or that came within your o!
servation afterwards?—I saw, in the evening
of that day, the governor of the palace, who
came to my lodgings to shelter himself ; and
he described to me :

In point of fact, the governor of the palace
took shelter at your house ?—He did. 1 went
out in the evening, about nine o’clock, and I
attempted

Mr. Garrow.—I submit to your lordship,
that what the governor of the palace said at
the time of taking shelter at the house of this
English gentleman, is evidence.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Do not let us go
into every particular of a transaction at that
distance.

Mr. Baron Hotham.—It is a history that is
pretty publicly known.

Mr. Garrow.—You were saying that you

went out in the evening?—Yes, about nine
e’clock. I did not see any thing worth men-
tioning. I went towards the bridge that leads
to the palace, where I was stopped by some
centinels from approaching nearer... I saw
the out-buildings of the palace were then
burning.
_ Lord Chief Justice Eyre —The whole of it
is, that there was a great tumult, a great
slaughter, and that the king and his family
sheltered themselves at the Convention, and
were not restored to their liberty afterwards.

Mr. Garrow.—Just so—we are perfectly
content to take it so.

Mr. Huskisson..—Every body knows that.

Mr. Garrow.—I believe every body knows,
except the jury.

Mr. Attorney General—I propose ta read
4wo letters, found in the possession of Mr.
Horne Tooke, and draughts of two letters in
Mr. Tooke’s hand-writing.

Attorney Goneral. . 7

Do you know in whose band-writing that


og’ is?—I think it, by the character, to be

delieve it to be his, though I did not see him
write it. / .

Look ‘at this paper?—The same hand-
writing.

Garrow.

Look at these four papers—see if you find
your name upon these, and whether you
seized these ?—Upon these two only.

Garrow.

Are you one of his majesty’s messengers?
—No; I am clerk to the public-office on

Were you present when these pape were
found?—Yes; they were found at Mr. Horne
Tooke’s house at Wimbledon.

Was that after Mr. Tooke was taken into
custody P—Yes, it was.

Where were they found?—Some were
found in bureaus, and some in other places.

Who were present when they were found?
—Mr. Frost and Mr. Vaughan.

Did they attend as friends of Mr. Tooke ?—
They did.

pers ?—These two papers (the two not spoken
to by Mr. Thornton) are marked by me, as

one of your friends, who resides in Lond
in whom you have an entire confidence, an
to whom we may give our money, in the as-

delay, and without fraud. Mr. Frost, to
whom I entrust this letter, is going to set out
immediately with Mr. Paine, for Paris, and
allows me no time for ceremony, if it were
necessary. I request you tu send me the
name of some Frenchman, in London, mer- —

tioned. Wecan now begin the public con-
tribution towards our patriotic gift with 1,000/,, ©

amount in time to several thousands.

“If you consider this step in the same
point of view that we do, you will see in it
much use to the common cause of England
and France. I entreat you to give me yeur
sentiments on the subject, and to paint out to
me the means by which I may be useful to
you. J. Horne Tooxs,”

which ought to unite men, and which will

one day unite all nations. These are prepar-

useful truths. Thus the philosophical socie-

glorious advantage of deserving the hatred of
.your government. The league of tyrants will
never be able to resist the power of reason.
Continue your precious labours —employ your-
selves in the enfranchisement and the happi-
ness of the human race. You will find in the
French, worthy fellow labourers.—Honoured
by the sentiments which you express for me,
receive the assurances of my lively gratitude.

was.

Look at these printed papers and’say, whe-
ther from their appearance you take them, to
be the French papers of those dates.—They
have every appearance of being similar to
those which I took in, while at Paris, and
afterwards in London.

Juseph Deboffe sworn. — Examined by Mr.
Garrow.
You are I understand a bookseller ?—Yes.
sy nets is your shop?—In Gerrard-street,

0.

Your shop was chiefly employed in selling
foreign publications I believe?—Yes, and not
only foreign publications, but all sorts of
works, and as to the newspapers which I sold,
they were the same that came through the
channel of the post office, and by others.

You sold French newspapers?—-Yes.

And these French newspapers came by
the channel of the post from France, and by
the channel of private conveyance?—Great
part of them came from Paris, by the packet,
then sent to Millet and Fector, and then for-
warded by the mail coach. I received no

apers, but what were duly opened at the
stom-house at Dover. : ‘

You are a native of France, I perceive ?—
No, I beg your pardon, I am a native of
Switzerland.

You are acquainted with the French lan-
guage ?—Yes. . .


You probably have had many thousand
French newspapers pass through your hands?
—I have.

Whether you are acquainted with thaf
paper the Nationale Gazette, or Universclle
Moniteur ?—Perfectly well, I have had a great
many of them.

Did you ever know of any of these French
papers with the French titles, and in that
shape, reprinted in England ?—-I have never
known it.

From the paper, from the type, and from
the general appearance of these papers which
you hold in your hand, comparing them with
the recollection of those which passed through
cu hand, in the way of your trade, do you

lieve these to be the French Moniteur,
published in France, and conveyed to this
country, in the way you have stated?—Per-
fectly so, and more than that, there are many
connexions in London, through which the
veracity of this, might be compared.

We are not permitted to compare them with .
others; is that French paper, and is it

rinted with French types?—It is the real
‘aris paper, printed in Paris by Mr. Pilnewood
who is the proprietor of it. I have received
‘hse immediately from Mr. Pilnewood’s own
ands,

Mr. Attorney General.—Then I offer to
your lordship the evidence of these three
Papers, one dated the 4th, another the 6th,
and another the 7th of January, 1793, upon
the evidence now given, which contain
speeches of citizen St. André, and citizen
Barrére. :

Mr. Erskine.—If your lordship thinks
these papers may be taken as evidence, I
have no interest in disputing it, I only wish
to have the sanction of the Court; Iam not
anxious about it.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I think it isa
reasonable evidence of their being what they
are described.

“Translation.

“ The question submitted to your delibera-
tion: is of the highest importance to public
order, of the greatest difficulty in lepalstan,
of the utmost delicacy in politics, absolutely
necessary to liberty, and connected with what-
ever is held most sacred by the nation.—The
calmness which has prevailed in the delibera-
tions, for some days past, forbodes that it
will be decided according to justice and rea-
son.—It will not escape history, this contrast
between kings, who often, amidst the dissi-

tion of courts, signed proscriptions, or the
Seat warrant of a thousand citizens; and
the representatives ofthe people, whodeliberate
with wisdom and caution on the punishment
of a single despot.—It is the destiny of kings
to be the occasion of the calamities of the peo-
ple, whether they remain on their thrones, or
whether they are precipitated from them.”

“The people of Paris, by making an holy
. insurrection against him [the king] on the
20th of August, deprived him of his charac-
ter of inviolability—The people of the other
departments applauded this insurrection, and
adopted the result of it—The people have,
therefore, already interposed to destroy the
royal inviolability —Louis was invested by the
tacit consent of the people, with a constitu-
tional inviolability; their tacit consent has
deprived' him of the same, and is therefore as
lawful as the grant of it.The inviolability of
the king cannnot be absolute; it is only rela-
tive, and for the end of maintaining the inde-
pendence of the constituted authorities.”

“ The people is the sovereign.

“ A convention differs from a legislature in
this respect: a legislature is only a species of
superintending magistracy; a moderator of
the powers of government: a convention, on
the contrary, is a representation of the sove-
reign.—The members of the legislative as-
sembly acted, in August, upon these princi-
ples; and they declared, in their account of
their motives for calling a national conven-
tion, that they saw but one measure which
could save France ; namely, to have recourse
to-the.supreme will of the people, and to in-
vite the people to exercise immediately that
inalienable right of sovereignty, which the
constitution had acknowledged, and which it
could not subject to any restriction.—The
public interest required, that the will of the
People should be manifested in the opinion of
& national corivention, formed of representa-
tives, invested by the people with unlimited

ers. The will of the peopte is manifested

yy the opinion of this convention —The con-

vention pee assembled, is itself that sove-

reign will which ought to prevail.—It would

be contrary to every principle, if the expres-

sion of the general will did not reside in the
convention alone.

“ You are the representatives of the nation,
which relies upon you for taking every mea-


sure of public safety, necessary to establish
and secure liberty, and to proscribe tyranny,
against which the nation has formed an holy
insurrection. :

“ Tt is despotism when, in the ordinary and
permanent establishment of a government,
there is no separation of powers —But is it
not the very essence of a constituent body to
concentre, for the time being, all authority?
—lIs it not the very nature of 2 national con-
vention to be the temporary image of the na-
tion; to unite, in itself, all the powers of go-
vernment, to employ them against the ene-
mies of liberty, and to distribute them ins
new social compact, called a constitution ?—
Behold that Constituent Assembly, which,
though abominably calumniated at present,
laid (in spite of the shameful revision of the
laws) the first foundation of your liberty. Be-
hold it alone, with its revolutionary genius;
it broke through every impediment, exceeded
its delegated authority, created its own pow:
according to the exigencies of liberty,
to the wants of the people; destroyed all pre-
judices by the force of that public opinion to
which it gave birth, obliterated all privileges,
abolished all parliaments, charged the form
of all property, as well as the sign of all
value, and made a perjured king its prisoner.
—Nothing was wanting to immortalize thas
assembly, but to have delivered France from
the calamity of kingly government, and to
have relieved you from the duty of judging
the last of your kings.

“Invested, from pom origin, with the
most unlimited confidence by your fellow ci-
tizens, you hesitate in the first step.

“ Am I then no longer in the midst of that
national convention, whose honourable mis-
sion it was to destroy kings‘and royalty ?”

Mr. Erskine.—I wish it to be understood,
that these gentlemen are speaking in their
place, as members of the National Assembly
in France. .

Mr. Attorney General.—I will explain the
view with which I offer it. .

Mr. Erskine.—You stated it very particu-
larly in your opening.

Mr. Attorney General.—You see they are
now speaking in their places, in the National
Assembly in France.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—It is hardly
worth debating; the Purpose is so obvious,
that it is impossible to be misunderstood.

“ The United Political Societies of Norwich.

March 5th, 1793.

“ Gentlemen ;—It is with peculiar satisfac-
tion, we are favoured with your correspondence
(not merely because you are so, although you
are better fitted to diffuse knowledge) but be,
cause you areembarked in the same magnani-
mous cause, which demands with alacnity the
attention of every individual; and itis with
the utmost regret we see so many, either from
ignorance, or something worse, who are
inimical to their own interest ; for nothing
contributes so much to support the oppressor,
as the ignorance of the oppressed ; for which
purpose the flood-gates have been opened
Panually, till, by degrees, the streams of cor-
ruption have nearly overflowed the land:
such as bounty acts, borrowing, qualification,
and septennial acts, besides standing armies,
excise and ittin laws, with various others
too painful for reflection, without credit to the
framers thereof, and without advantage to
society. We do not presume to recapitulate
these abuses for Pipe information, but being
too experimentally acquainted with them, we
wish to find out a method of redress. At
present we see a great propriety in universal
suffrage, and annual elections, but we beg you
will be obliging enough to inform us of what

ou have collected of the sense of the people

yy your correspondents. We have to inform
you, that our worthy Corresponding Societies
of London, have recently submitted three pro-
positions for our investigation. First, whether
-@ petition to parliament, or an address to the
king, or aconvention, _ :

“Permit us briefly to state our views for

our revisal ; and with respect to the first, we

hold we are a conquered people. Wehave
tamely submitted to the galling yoke, and
resistance in the present circumstances is
vain. We cannot act the man, and as neces-
sity has no law, we think ourselves under that
degrading necessity to state our grievances to
the House of Commons, with a request for
redress, and should they refuse to grant our
reasonable petition, we have still got (no
thanks to them) a formidable engine, that will
convey the insylt to the remotest parts of the
kingdom. As to the propriety of the second,
we wish to submit to your superior judgment,
and should esteem it a favour to be informed
of the result; forat present we are dubious of
its good consequences, Lastly, a convention,
and ol ! that the period were arrived !—but
in the present state of affairs, alas! it’s im-
practicable: yet this is the object we pursue,
and esteem any other means only in subordi-
nation to, and as having a tendency to ac-
complish that desirable end.

“ We wish to be in unison with our brethren
and fellow-labourers, and should be glad of
any information as soon as it is convenient:
and we beg your advice whether it is’ neces-
sary, as soon as possible, to collect signatures
te a petition for a: real representation of the

q : :

fer and by whom to present it, whether |

Coke, Mr. Burch, or any of the Friends of
the People; and whether it is attended with
any expense. Our. members are both inimical to
the business.

“ We can give you no accurate statement
of the representation in our neighbourhood,
only observe, that it is equally farcical here as
elsewhere. To conclude, with united th——
for all favours received, wishing you h——
and success, and may heaven avert
We subscribe ourselves, gentlemen—Your
very obliged humble servants,

as illegal and unconstitutional.

“ The following letter was produced and

« To S, Butler and @. Bond, esqrs.

“ Gentlemen ;—It is not easy for men, who
feel strongly and sincerely, to convey those
feelings by Ictter. We therefore rely an
your Conceiving for us much of that which we
are unable to express to you. We think,
however, that we shall be guilty of a great
omission, did we neglect the opportunity of
sending you by Mr. Hamilton Rowan,t ihe
honest tribute of our esteem and admiration,
for your brave and manly resistance to the’
usurped jurisdiction of the Irish aristocracy.

“ Permit us to offer you our thanks, and
our grateful acknowledgment of your efforts,
in what we consider as a common cause,
while we lament our inability of proving our-
selves useful in your defence. Although we
are of different kingdoms, still we are but one
peor ; and as the freedom of one continent

as spread its influence to Europe, so on the
other hand, we are persuaded, that the esta-
blishment of despotism in Ireland, must end
in the slavery of Great Britain. But the light
of liberty is not confined to one shore, or one
latitude.

“ We know that it is easier to admire than
to practise those virtues that tend to.the public
benefit.

“ Yet so long as the exertions of a few
courageous men must influence the minds of
at least the independent and thinking part of
the community, we are assured that their
labour is not fruitless. We trust, therefore,
the time will soon arrive, when the abuse of
power in either nation, will have no other
consequence than the ruin of those who have
committed that injustice. We hope, and we
doubt not of soon seeing the day, when the
post of honour shall be no longer that af
obloquy and punishment; but when those
who have risked their liberty and fortune in
the cause of their countrymen, may find pro=
tection in the undisputed, uninterrupted exer-
cise of trial by jury, with a full and adequate
Tepresentation of the people in parliament,

“ Resolved, That the said letter be signed
by the chairman and secretary ; and that Mr.
Hamilton Rowan be requested to convey the
same to Mr. Butler and Mr. Bond.”

“ Sir;—We have to acknowledge, with
great satisfaction, the letter which you fa-
voured us with, dated the 5th instant, relative
to the most desirable of all other objects, the
reform of our parliamentary representation.
The honour you do us in supposing that we
arc better fitted than yourselves for the pro-
motion of political knowledge, we must dis-
claim ; because we observe, with the greatest
pleasure, that our country correspondents

ve too much zeal and information to want
success in their public endeavours, whether at
Notwich, at Sheffield, at Manthester, or else-
where throughout the nation. In our sin-
cerity for the good of our country, we trust
that we are all equal; and as such we doubt
not of our ultimate success.

“ We sce with sorrow the existence of those
evils, which you so justly represent as the
streams of corruption overflowing this once
free and prosperous country. e see with
surprise and abhorrence, that men are to be
found both able and willing to support those
corruptions. It is however no small consola-
tion to find, that others are not wanting in
every part of the nation of an_opposite cha-
acter, who are ready to remedy, by all lauda-
ble and honourable means, the defect in our
representation, the usurped extension of the
duration of parliaments, and other grievances
such as you notice in your letter.

That the constitution of England has no
more of that character it once possessed ; that
the supposed democracy of the country has
become a matter of property and privilege ;
and that we have therefore no longer that
mixt government which our adversaries are
praising, when they know it is no longer in
our possession, are facts notorious and indis-
putable. Where then are we to look for the
remedy? To that parliament of which we


°

[552

complain ?—To the executive power, which is
implicitly obeyed, if not anticipated in that
parliament ?—Or to ourselves, represented in
some meeting of delegates, for the especial
purpose of reform, which we suppose you un-
derstand by the term, CONVENTION ?

«It is the end of each of these propositions
that we ought to look to; and as success in »
good cause must be the effect of persev
and the rising reason of the time, let us deter-
mine with coolness, but let us persevere with
decision. As to a Convention, we regard it
as a plan the most desirable and most prac-
ticable, so soon as the great body of the people
shall be courageous and virtuous enough to
join us in the attempt. Hitherto we have no
reason to believe that the moment is arrived
for that purpose. As to any petition to the
crown, we believe it hopeless in its conse-
quences. With respect to the last of Fd
Proposals, we are ata loss to advise. If the.
event is looked to in the vote which may be
obtained from that body to whom the petition
is to be addressed, which of us can look to it
without the prospect of an absolute negative ?
In this point of view, therefore, it cannot re-
quire a moment's consideration. But if we
regard the policy of such a petition, it may, in
our apprehension, be well worth considering
as a warning voice to our present legislators,
and as a signal for imitation to the majority of
the people. Should such a plan be vigorously
and generally pursued, it would hold out a
certainty to our fellow-countrymen, that we
are not a handful of individuals unworthy of
attention or consideration, who desire the
restoration of the ancient liberties of England ;
but, on the contrary, it might bring into light
that host of well-meaning men, who in the
different towns and counties of this realm are
silently but seriously anxious for reformation
in the government. We exhort you with
anxiety to pursue your laudable endeavours
for the common good, and never to despair of

the public cause.

convention of delegates of the different socie-

motion be inserted in the letter.” "

Mr. Garrow.—Before the next entry is read
Perhaps it will be convenient that I should
put in the original draft of these instructions,
as there are several material alterations.

Mr. Daniel Adams.—Examined by Mr. ;

Garrow,

Look at that letter, and state whether that
is your signature ?—It is,
In whose hand-writing is the letter ?—My

own.

The whole of it is in your own hand-writing?
—Yes,

Look at this other paper, are these the in-
structions, which were originally prepared for
the delegates upon which your entry is after-
wards made ?—~I cannot take upon me to say
ay at the length of time.

is was found among your papers we have
heard ?—Yes.

What do you take that paper to be?—I
should not know it but from my own hand-
writing at the bottom,—I should not know it
to be the same otherwise.

Look at it—Do you believe it to be an

being transcribed into the book of the society ?
—I do not know it for any other reason—here
are a vast many interlineations which I cannot
bring to my recollection at all.

It was a paper you were afterwards to trans-
cribe into your book?—It appears like a pa-
per Iwas to transcribe; there are a great
many interlineations in it.

Mr. Erskine—Can you venture to give
any thing like a distinct account of how that
paper came to be so interlined as itis now }—

cannot.

Mr. Erskine.—Nor can you tell whether
that was given to you for the purposes of in-
serlion, but that it was so obliterated that you
were obliged to make another copy ?—That I
cannot tell.

Mr. Garrow.—Supposing that paper to
agree with your fair transcript, should you
believe then, that that is the paper which you
tsanscribed fairly into the minute?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—That is reason-
ing him into a belief; if he has any recollec-
tion upon the subject very well; ifhe has not
you must not argue him into a belief of it.

[Mr. Garrow pointed out to the Court, the va-

[Copy of therough draught.]

«“ The delegates are instructed on the part
of this society, to assist in bringing forward
any petition or petitions to the House of Com-
mons, for the purpose of procuring an inquiry
in the said House, into the state of the repre-
sentation of the Commons of Great Britain in
parliament. That they shall also demand in
such petition or petitions, a specific remedy
for the past, present, and possible abuses, in
the nt system of representation, and an
avowal of the right of eternal reform. That
in specifying the principles upon which re-
dress ought to be demanded, the delegates
have particular relation to those expressed in
Mr. Pitt’s speeches, before he was a placeman:
in the duke of Richmond’s letter to col. Shar-
man, before he was a minister ; in Mr. Flood’s

bh, upon his motion for a reform in par-

Lament ; but above all, in the constitutional

.strictures, contained in the defence of John

Horne Tooke, at the suit of Charles James

Fox, in an action for debt. And _ that the de-

legates do demand a ght of voting for mem-

bers of parliament, in favour of all persons not
infants, paupers, lunatics, placemen or pen-
sioners. That voting ought to be only in the
places or districts of te residence of the
voter. That the time of election ought to be
very short, and the collecting the votes be

in as many different places im a district
at once, asmay be conveniently and accurately


taken; but above all, that the duration of par-
liament ought to be annual. And that a rea-
sonable compensation ought tobe made bya
national contribution to the members of the
liament. ‘

“That the delegates do posctuslly corres-
pond with the society, for the purpose of re-
rceiving farther instructions, as the exigency
may require.

to the delegates.

“ Adjourned to Friday next.”

rections, to the delegates :

“ The delegates are instructed on the part
of this society, to assist in bringing forward,
and supporting any constitutional measures,
for procuring a real representation of the
Commons of Great Britain, in parliament.
That they shall also demand a remedy for the
abuses in the present system of representa-
sion. That in specifying the redress to be
demanded of existing abuses, the delegates
ought never to lose sight of the two essential
principles, general su and. annual repre-
sentation, together with the unalienable nght
in the people to reform. And that a reason-
able and known compensation ought to be
made to the representatives of the nation by a
national contribution.

“« Resolved, That law ceases to be an object
of obedience whenever it becomes an instru-
ment of oppression. , .

“ Resolved, That we recall to mind, with
the deepest satisfaction, the merited fate of

the infamous Jefferys, once lord chief’ justice

of England, who at the era of the glorious re-
volution, for the many iniquitous sentences
which he had passed, was torh to pieces by a
byave and injured people. ns :

solved, that Mr. Gerrald be called tu the

may divide countries, ought not, and does
not, make a separation between those prin-
ciples of common severity, in which English-
men and Scotchmen are equally interested ;
that injustice in Scotland, is injustice in Eng-
land, and that the safety of Englishmen is
endangered, whenever their brethren, in
Scotland, for a conduct which entitles them
to the approbation of all wise, and the support
of all brave men,:are sentenced to Botany
Bay, a punishment hitherto inflicted only on
felons.

“ Resolved, That we see with regret, but
‘we see without fear, that the period is fast
approaching when the liberties of Britons
must depend not upon reason, to which they
‘have long appealed, nor on their powers of
expressing it, but on their firm and.undaunted
resolution to oppose tyranny by the same
means by which it is exerciscd.

“ Resolved, That we approve of the con-
duct of the British Convention, who, though
assailed by force, have not been answered by
argument, and who, unlike the members of a
certain assembly, have no interest distinct
from the common body.of the people. a

“ Resolved, ‘That a copy of the above reso-
dations be transmitted to citizen William

G Friends and Fellow Citizens ;—Although
we have hitherto been the silent, yet we
have by no means been the unconcerned
Bpeeintova of your conduct and sufferings.

Ve have seen and approved of your exertions
for your country’s happiness; we have marked,

with honest indignation, every step that your |

enemics have taken to bring you to your pre-
sent situation.—Your enemies are the ene-
mies of public liberty:—the men whe are
conspiring against the happiness of mankind.
—The cause in which you embarked, and to
which you have borne an honourable testi-
mony, is worthy of every exertion, and its
importance to the world too great to expect
its Lig Sibel without sppecition:

“The hietory of liberty, for whose sake
you ate doomed to a long and unmerited exile,
will afford, in the present instance, that con-
solation that former martyrs to the samc
cause have experienced; the consolation that
ou will not, you cannot suffer in vain.

“ Mian mray perish, but trath will prevail ;
neither persecution, nor banishment, nor
death itself, can finally injure the progress of
those principles which involve the general

pirress of man.

«© While, therefore, we join every friend to
humanity in lamenting what you have al
ready perehi a bare ape a an-
ticipate the’ to which you may ex-
posed in a crea and uncultivated country ;
yet we can rejoice, that the sourees of happi-



ness are limited to no place, but are 4s ex-
tensive as the dominion of God :——under the
protection of that Great Being may you, at
all times, and in all places, feel the pleasure
that arises from conscious integrity.

“ Fellow citizens, we assure you, that the
memory of your virtues shall never be effaced
from our breasts; the cause for which you
have struggled, is a glorious cause; the world
that has witnessed your exertions, shall wit
ness ours also.—A full and fait representation
of the people of Great Britain we seek, with
all the ardour of men and Britons; for the
sake of which we are not only ready to act
with vigour and unanimity, but, we trust,
prepared also to suffer with constancy. ,

“Our best wishes will ever attend you;
and we do believe that the day is not very
distant when we shall again receive you, on
British shores, the welcome children of a rxEB
and nappPy country.”

“ Resolved, That the same be sent to
Messrs. Muir, Palmer, Skirving, Margarot,
and Gerrald. ~

“ Ordered, That the said address be pub-
lished in the newspapers.

“Mr. Joyce gave notice, that he would,
on Friday next, bring forward a motion rela-
tive to the speech of Mr. Dundas, on Tuesday
last, respecting the introduction of Scotch law
in England.

“ Read a letter from the London Corres-
ponding Society.

“ Resolved, That the same be entered on
the books of this society.

March 97th, 1794.

“ To the Secretary of the Society for Con-
stitutional Information.

“ Citizens ;—I am directed, by the London
Corresponding Society, to transmit the follow.
ing resolutions to the Society for Constitu-
tional Information, and to request the senti-
ments of that society, respecting the impor-
tunt measures which the present juncture of
atlairs seems to require.

“ The London Corresponding Society con-
ccives, that the moment is arrived when a full
and explicit declaration is necessary frgm all
the friends of freedom,—Whether the late
illegal and unheard-of prosecutions and sen-

.tences shall determine us to abandon our

cause, or shall excite us to pursue a radical re-
form, with an ardour proportioned to the
magnitude of the object, aad with a zeal as
distinguished, on our parts, as the treachery of
others, in the same glorious cause, is notorivus.
The Society for Constitutional Information is
therefore required to determine, whether or
no they will be ready, when called upon, to
act in conjunction with this and other societies,
to obtain a fair representation of the people.—
Whether they concur with us in seeing the
necessity of a spcedy convention, for the pur-
pose of obtaining, in aconstitutional and legal
method, a redress of those grievances under
which we, at present, labour, and which can

Yepresentation of the Prorrr of Great Britain.
The London Corresponding Society cannot
but remind their friends, that the present
crisis demands all the prudence, unanimity,
and vigour, that ever may or can be exerted
by Mew and Britons; nor do they doubt, but
what manly firmness and constancy will
finally, and they believe shortly, TERMINATE
in the full accomplishment of all their wishes.
I an, fellow citizen (in my humble measure),
a friend to the rights of man,
(Signed) «“ T, Harpy, secretary.”

“ Resolved unanimously, 1st, That dear as
Justice and Lrsenty are to Britons, yet the
value of them is comparatively small, without
a dependence on their permanency ; and there
can be no security for the continuance of any
Right, but in reuat Laws.

“2nd, That equal laws can never be ex-
pected, but by a full and fair representation of
the people.—To obtain which, in the way
pointed out by the constitution, has been and
1s the sole object of this society—For this we
‘are ready to hazard every thing; and never,
but with our lives, will we relinquish an object
which involves the happiness, or even the poli-
tical existence of ourselves and posterity.

“8rd, That it is the decided opinion of this
society, that, to secure ourselves from future
iJlegal and scandalous prosecutions, to prevent
‘a rupetition of wicked and unjust sentences,
and to recall those wise and wholesome laws
that have deen wrested from us, and of which
scarcely a'vestige remains ; there ought to be
immediately a Convention of the Prorre, by
delegates, deputed for that purpose, from the
different societies of the Friends of Freedom,
assembled in the various parts of this nation.
And we pledge ourselves to the public, to
pursue ever A al method speedily to accom-
Plish so desirable a purpose.

“ P. S. I have to inform you, that a general
meeting of the society will be holden on
Monday, the 14th of April, the place to be
announced by public advertisement. —-

“Resolved, That it is fit and proper, and
‘the duty of this society, to send an answer to
the London Corresponding Society.

“ Ordered, ‘That the secretary acquaint the
London Corresponding Society, that we have
received their communication, and heartily
concur with them in the objects they have in
view; and that, for the purpose of a more
speedy and effectual co-operation, we invite

em to send to this society, next Friday

“Resolved, That the following address be
sent to Messrs. Muir, Palmer, Skirving, Mar-
garot, and Gerrald:

“ Friends and Fellow Citizens ;—Although
we have hitherto been the silent, yet we
have by no means been the unconcerned spec=
tators of your conduct and sufferings. We
have seen and approved of your exertions for
your country’s -happiness—We have marked
with honest indignation, every step that your
enemies have taken to bring you to your
present situation. Your enemies are the
enemies of Pugtrc Liperty, the men who
are conspiring against the happiness of man-
kind. The cause in which you are embarked,
and to which you have borne an honvurable
testimony, is worthy of every exertion, and
its importance to the world too great, to ex-
pect its accomplishment without opposition.

“The history of liberty, for whose sake
you are doomed to a long and ynmerited

exile, will afford, in the present instance, that
consolation that former martyrs to the same
cause have experienced ; the consolation, that
you will not, you cannot, suffer in vain. ;

“ Men may perish, but truth will prevail ;
neither persecution, por banishment, nor
death itself, can finally injure the progress of
those principles which involve the general

ppiness of man. .

“ While, therefore, we join every friend to
humanity in lamenting what you have already
endured, and with anxious hearts, anticipate
the perils to which you may be exposed in a
barren and uncultivated country, yet we can
rejoice that the sources of happiness are
limited to no place, but are as extensive as
the dominion of Gop; under the protection
of that Great Brinc, may you at all times,
and in all places, feel the pleasure that arises
from conscious integrity.

“ Fellow-citizens, we assure you that the
memory of your virtues shall never be effaced
from our breasts; the cause for which you
have struggled, is a glorious cause, the world
that has witnessed your exertions, shall witness
ours also

“A full and fair representation of the
people of Great Britain, we seek with all
the ardour of men and Britons, for the sake
of which we are not only ready to act with
vigour and unanimity, but we trust, prepared
also to suffer with consluncy.

“ Qur best wisires will ever attend you, and
we do believe that the day is not very distant,
when we shall again receive you on the
British shores, the welcome children of a
Free and Hapey Country.

« By Order of the Society.”

“To the Chairman of the Society for Con-
stitutional Information.”
“ Surprise Transport, April 16, 1794.

© Fellow Citizens;—I have long since looked
upon your society with admiration and esteem,
considering it as the source and school of
most of the political information, which, by
the blessing of God, has overspread the
island. I have been instructed by the wis-
dom of your papers, and animated by the
spirit of your addresses. That my conduct is
epproved by such a society, is my pride and
my joy. ;
** You say (es the consideration is the
eupport of my life), that the history of liberty
will prove by the experience of her former
martyrs, that sufferings in her cause cannot be
én vain, That my sufferings may not be in
wain, I ardently wish that the eyes of my
countrymen were open, not: only to the ille-
gality and despotism of my sentence, but to
the alarming measures ty which it was
brought about. My jury was three times
packed by the servants of the crown before tt
vet upon me. In the first instance by the
sheriff's deputy, placemen immediately ap-

inted by the crown; in the second, by the
erownagent, ford advocate, éc, at Edinburgh;


and in the third, by the justiciary lords, who
tried thecause. These last, arbitrarily appoint
the fitteen particular persons who are to sit
upon the accused. The strongest objections
are mere air, as the lords alone are the judges
of the validity of them. A majority of the
fifteen condemns. If, therefore, ministry,
with theig all-extensive influence, can in
three countries find only eight servile tools
subservient to their views, the fortune, the
liberties, the lives of all Scotland are at their
mercy. Trial is condemnation. ‘The sen-
tence is appointed hefore-hend by the mipis-
ter, and mine was known a full week at
Edinburgh before it was uttered. They can
tuin, or even murder whom please.
This infamous robbery of the first right of
Englishmen, a trial by jury fairly chosen, I
have endeavoured to set forth in a letter to
the editor of the Morning Chronicle, last
October or November, of the date (if I remem-
ber rightly) of the 22nd or 27th, of which I
now avow myself the author, to which I beg
leave to draw the attention of the Suciety for
Constitutional Information. Farewell, tellow-
citizens.—I am, with respect and esteem,
your equal brother,
“Tuomas Frsus Pacuge.
“ Surprize, Spithead, April 16, 1794.”

“ Surprize Transport, Spithead,
April 17, 1794

“ Mr. President ;—Permit me, si, to assure
you, and the respectable Constitutional So-
ciety, that the very consoling uddress, re
ceived agreeably to their resolutiun of the
28th ult. has excited in me, as also in the
hearts of each of my fellow martyrs, for the
important cause of universal suffrage, end
annual parliaments, the most lively sensations
of gratitude and esteem. The Constituttopal
Society was the foremost of true patriots to
raise the Standard of Reform, for the purpose
of redeeming from the contaminating and
contagious influence of corruption, those
venerable, but almost lost principles of the
British constitution, Wrought into it by the
blood and irresistible energies of our fore
fathers, many of whom, rather than that
these principles, upon which depend the
virtue and felicity of Society should be lost
sight of, exhibited their high esteem of them
on scaffolds and in dungeons; that all, even
the most callous spectators might be per-
suaded, that the truths for which they did
not reckon even their lives too dear a sacrifice,
were surely worthy of the unprejudiced inves
tigation of all. Your remark therefore is
just, and it is very soothing to us, “ We do
not, we cannot suffer fur such « cause in votn.”
The resentment of our enemies, driving them
into such absurd measures towards men,
against whom vice of any kind is not evea
alleged, must have moved in every unpreju-
diced mind, the restless question; Why?
Why are men who seek the improvement of
their species thrown with felens into dun-

geons? And full information must follow
sincere inquiry, and at length convert all to
the side of truth and righteousness. I therd-
fore cheerfully consent to suffer to promote
the general good.

“We are blamed as baving yremabsecly,
at least, exposed ourselves to the necessity of
sealing by our sufferings, the cause we would
promote. If in this case we have erred, I
will readily take the whole blame, as having
strained every nerve to press forward the
measure of a general convention, as being the
only means to avert impending ruin. I
sought to erouse and alarm my countrymen to
consider their extreme danger. I feared that
the necessity for such association would be on
ws before we were prepared for it. Besides,
what measure could possibly interest so much
the public inquiry? what has so much in-
creased public information? It excited counter
associations, and caused every man to see
‘who were on the side of truth, and who were
on the side of corruption: {t exposed the
selfish and interested designs of the one, and
the unfeigned proseeution of the public good
by the other. [ speak so with the greater
eonfidence before a Society that must have
marked the progress of information eo long
under their own auspices. You must know
that this progress, the exciting the inquiry of
the public, has been more extensively effected
during the last year, then during the ten
preceding ones. The eause was the General
Convention. The terror and hatred of mi-
mistry to it proves the truth. Whe then
would have refused even his life to have been
instrumental in promoting so much good ?

“Your explicit approbation of our conduct
has prompted this self-exultation; forgive
therefore my freedom. I may be mistaken.
The important revolution in human affairs,
to which every Chrietian looks with anxious
hope, may be yet distant. If it is, tyreuny
may still triumph. But God forbid it. It
would then be better to die than to live.
But though I hope the reverse, I know, as
you justly observe, ‘ That the importance of
* the cause of freedom is too great to the world,
“to expect its accomplishment without oppo-
“ sition,’ and the opposition of despairing
tyranny will be dreadful, it will be destruc-
tive; and why?—because nothing but its

ruining last struggle will rouse mankind trom

Marsellois March, the Democrat, and a new
piece of music, called the ‘ Free Consritu-

“ After dinner the following sentiments
were given with unbounded applause :—

“1, THE RIGHTS OF MAN.

“2. A Free Constitution.

“A citizen then rose, and in a short speech
observed, that the Stewards seemed to have
pace in their list of toasts,a person who
had done more than almost any man towards
the Reign of Peace and Liberty; he would,
therefore, propose asa toast “ lord Stanhope.”
An amendment was proposed, that instead of
Lord Stanhope, Citizen Stanhope should be
drank, which was received with thundering
applause.

* 9, May the Public Revenue never be ap-
plied to the purposes of corruption.

ertions in the cause of Freedom.

“Mr. Wharton thanked the company for
their marked approbation of his conduct, and
pledged himself to continue ‘his efforts in the
cause of Liberty. He then said he would pro-
pose as a toast,

“15, That steady Friend to Liberty, John
Horne Tooke.

“ Mr. Tooke said, he hoped it would be the
last time that his health should be drank. His
ambition was, that hereafter Ais mEmonY
should be given.

“16. MAY ALL GOVERNMENTS BB

toast, a sentiment directly in opposition to
that of Mr. Windham.

“ 18. Prosperity to the commerce and ma-
nufactures of Great Britain.”

that the jury could have beds at the Hum-

Mr. Louzun.—I found this printed paper i

Tuos. Hanpy.

mittee of Constitution of the London Cor-

responding Society, Printed for the use

of the members.] ‘

“ Fellow Citizens 3~-Knowing, from expe-
rience, that those who (through thre depraved
state of what should be the representative
body) are suffered to prey on the vitals of our
country, derive the principal part of their suc-
cess in opposing an equ: representation,
from the active circulation of falsehoods, re-
Serine this, and other similar societies 3 we
think it advisable, that you should give an
explicit declaration of your PRINCIPLES
and WISHES, which we conceive to be as
follow :

“1. That all men are by nature free, equal
and independent of each other.


“ 2. That, to enjoy all the advantages of
civil society, it is not necessary that indivi
duals should relinquish more of their natoral
independence than is required to fulfil this
injunction, Let the minority yield a friendly
submission to the majority.”

“3. That no majority, however great, can
justly deprive the minority of any part of their
civil rights :—wherever it is attempted, the
social bond is broken, and the minority have
a right to resist.

“4. The civil rights of every individul
are equality of voice, in the making of laws,
and in the choice of persons by whom those
laws are to be administered.—Equality before
the law, whether in claiming its protection,
or submitting to its sentence. Freedom to
publish his opinion, to exercise his religious
worship without molestation or restriction,
and to enjoy his property, subject pay to such
contributions as may be impartially levied
for the public service.

“ 8. Submission to any measure does not
imply silence as to the propriety or impro-
priety thereof. .

“6. Every power intrusted to a magistrate,
implies a responsibility for the exercise of that
power.

“7. The foregoing are not new, but are the
otizinal principles of English government,

“8. The total departure from the princi
of equality in the election of the legislative
body, commonly called the House of Com-
mons, is the chief cause why the people of
Britain are now ceprasen kt the Lege of =
foregoii inciples ; a in place thereof,
inbour cRderaemicied systema of extortion
and monopoly. . .

“9 The Corn act—is a grievance imme-
diately resulting from the restriction of the
choice of fepesonnaiyes, Pp men of ion

3 by it the price of bread in ge
Laas fe sometimes much more than
doubled; for whenever this country happens
to be blessed with an abundant season, a pé
of the taxes under which we groan, is applied
to encourage the exportation, and advance
the price of com. Thus we pay one tex to
government, to give the landed man an oppot-
tunity of laying on another. The hackneyed
pretence for this act is, ‘ the welfare of the
‘ farmer.’ The real intention ofit is, to enable,
the monopolizers of farms, to pay enormous
rents, :

“10. Game laws.--though teo evidently
calculated to disarm the nation, may in ge-
neral be attributed to the same restriction :-—
by them, even the farmer, on whose property
the game is fed, is robbed of every constitu-
tional right of a Briton, and subjected to the
brutality of a bashaw in the form of a country

justice, from whom there is no appeal.

“11, Excise laws—and stamp creties (and

the consequent systenr of spies and informers)
equally repair to the professed principles
oO

the constitution, amd most extensive in

their oppression ; ate often introduced merely
 577)

as engines of corporation influence ; for in
some instances, the produce of the tax does
mot pay the expense of collection; were the
sense of the nation fairly taken, it is impossi-
ble to believe but that whatever sum might
be necessary for the public servite, it would
be raised by means fess obnoxioas and less
expensive,

© 12. The mutiny act—which would never
have existcd, had not the bulk of the people
been excluded from representation. It re-
flects a charge of: hypocrisy on those who
affect to bewail the late events in France, yet
calmly view the defendcrs of their own coun-
try, subjected to every specics of fraud, insult,
and cruelty. The military excellence of true
republicans, in al! ages, proves it to be unne-
cessary. Convince a Briton, that he is about
to fight for a country in which his rights are
duly consulted, and the cat of nine-tails may
be burnt by the hands ef the common hang-
man.

“13. The impress service—equally cruel
with the foregoing, is another effect of partial
representation : it has lately been proved that
the expense of this service, if applied to in-
crease the seamen’s pay, would render im-
pressing unnecessary; but it is more consis-
tent with the government of a faction, to dis-
tribute the sum among the officers of corpo-
rations.

“14. The ill effects of partial representa-
tion are not confined to men in private sta-
tions; we challenge contradiction when we
assert that, in general, promotion, whether in
the army, navy, or church, is the effect of
parliamentary connection, and the reward of
parliamentary prostitution. <

“15, We cannot entertain a doubt that th
foregoing statement of grievances will be ad-
mitted as just by our countrymen at large,
and also that an equal representation, by uni-
versal and‘annual suffrage, would tend imme-
diately to redress them. It remains to prove
that the difficulties said to attend such a
scheme are merely the chimerical inventions
of interested men.

“16. Let us suppose all partial corpora-
tions (those badges FP eiavery abolished ; and
consider the whole island as one corporation,
divided into counties or cities, for the pur-
poses of embodying and exercising militia,

c. and for electing representatives, sub-
divided into districts, or townships, as nearly
@s convenient, in equal pruportion to the
number of inhabitants.

“ 17. Allow to each district, or township,
one representative, and let it be subdivided
into parishes, and every man entitled to a
vote, be registered in the parish in which he
resides. Large parishes may be subdivided
into wards, or hamlets.

“18, Let every voter give his vote in the
arish in which he resides; let the votes be
Fought in writing, and called for in succes-
sion, either alphabetically, by the name of the
voters, or numerically by the wards and nuin-



bers of houses ;—either of these methods
would prevent that source of riot, the practice
of voting in party groups.

“19, The truth of entry of every individual
vote in each el would easily be examined,
and the totals of the several parishes in each
district so easily collected, that we scruple
not to assert, a general election might be de-
cided, with indisputable certainty, in twelve
hours. .

« 20. In saying the whole island should be
considered as one corporation, we do nog
wish to be understood as recommending that
districts should choose their representatives
from distant parts. On the contrary,’ we
think the representative should always be a
resident of the district, as his character would
be better known to his constituents. Learsay
characters are seldom any other than the bla-
zouings of faction. ;

“1. It is indispensable to good govern=
ment, that representatives should be paid for
their sérvice to the public. The want of oper
and honourable reward, retards the exertion
of laudable characters, and subjects the na-
tion to the fraudulent and delusive practices
of mock patriots.

* 92. ‘To those who are convinced of the
propriety of the foregoing ideas, and only ask,

ow shall we attain the practice of them? wa
answer, dssociate. By so doing, you will bet-
ter correct and strengthen each other’s opi-
nions on the subject of liberty, and eventually
abash the tools of corrupt influence and law,
less power—effects which are not to be ex-
pected from the vague and desultory exertion
ef individual opinions.

“Tlaving thus stated’ what we conceive to
be the sentiments of the society, we recoin-
mend that the members shall meet in divi-
sions, consisting as nearly as convenient of
thirty members each, and that the manage~
ment of its affairs be vested in one COM MIT-
TEE OF DELEGATES, one SELECT
COMMITTERF, and one COUNCIL, subject
to REFERENCE JO THE DIVISIONS
and TRIAL BY JURY, as more particularly
defined in the following sections : ;

“ SECTION I.—Form of Admission and
Duty of a Menter,

“4, Each candidate for admission into this
society shall be proposed by a member, who
shall either belong to the division in which
the proposal is made, or be personally known
as a member of this sucicty, to two members
of such division.

“Q, The secretary shall enter the name,
pvesidence, and occupation of the candidate,
together with the proposer’'s name, and num
ber, in the minute book of the division, and
the president shall put the following question
to the proposer : . . og 8

“« Are you well acquainted with the candidate
you propose, with his means of life, and his
pelts! principles, and ure you well assured
2P

that his general character is such as will not
be disgraceful to this society %

“3. Ifthe proposer shall answer’ the fore-

ing question in the affirmative, the presi-

ent shall demand of the division, whether
any member has any objection to the candi-
ate.

“ 4. If no objection satisfactory to the di-
vision shall be made, the pen shall put
the following questions to the candidate:

Are you convinced that every man who has
attained to years of discretion, ts in possession
of his reason, and not disqualified by crimes,
ought to have a vote for a representative, and
not more than one vote?

“ Are ap convinced that the representation
ought to be divided as nearly as possible in pro-
portion to the number of electors ¥

“ Are you convinced that the election of re-
Ppresentatives of the people ought to be annual ?

“ Will you, by all justifiable means, endea-
pour to promote a reform in the parliament
Of this country, agreeable to the principles
which you have now professed ¥

_@6. No member shall be allowed to stile
himself, or any other, by any party name,
whether intended to convey respect or disre-

spect.

- “7, All political appellations which do not
in their immediate interpretation convey an
idea of political sentiment or situation, are
party names. The following do not fall
under this objection, as will appear by their
explanations :

“ Republican,—One who wishes to promote
the general welfare of his country.

- © Democrat,—A supporter of the rights and
power of the people.

“ Aristocrat,—One who wishes to promote
the interest of a few at the expense of many.

“ Royalist,—Among the ignorant part of
mankind, signifies, a person attached to regal
government: among artful courtiers, it isa
veil for their own aristocracy
- “ Loyalist,—A supporter of the constitution
of his country. :

“ Citizen,—The ancient appellation given
to the members of free states.

« Subject,—can only with propriety be ap-
plied to a member of a state, whose govern-
ment has been instituted by foreign conquest,
or the prevalence of a domestic faction.

‘ Power of a Division.

“1, Each division shall meet once in a

« 3, Each division shall elect from its own
members, a president, vice-president, secre-
tary, assistant secretary, delegate and sub-de-
legate. | ‘

three books (viz.) one to bear the number of
the division,—a similar book, to be called the
supernumerary book of the same division,—
and a third for entering minutes.

“5, No division book shall contain more
than 30 effective names ;—subject to variation
as hereafter mentioned.

«6. Members admitted after the division

supernumerary-book, but not before. .

‘“©7, As soon as the members entered in
the supernumerary-book, shall amount to 16,
they shall be entitled toa number as anew
division: they shall determine the time and
place of their future meeting; they shall re-
ceive a supernumerary-book, and a minute-
book, and a new supernumerary book shall be
delivered to the original division.

“8. Members entered in any supernume-
rary-book while less than 16, shall be entitled
to vote, and, in every respect, be considered
as members of the division to which such

stranger shall not be introduced more than
twice, exccpt for the purpose of admission as
@ member.

“98. In case of persecution, and that the
means provided by the VIIth, VI¥Ith, and
1Xth sections of this constitution, should not
produce the cffect of re-establishing a repre-
sentative body of this society for two weeks
successively, every division shall have power
to elect four persons, whose powers shall be
the same as the four officers of the committee
of delegates.

“ Q4, The sole object of those four persons,
shall be the reestablishment of the represen-
tative body, and they shall report progress
weekly, and be weekly subject to revocation.

Mr. Attorney General.—It then goes on to
state the mode of election; the duty of the

quish the station which you are about to take in
this society, on account of any persecution
which may be brought on it. That you will per-
severe in meeting the select committee, and to
the utmost of your power, encourage every other

—There was tu have been; but I never had

profit, : :

_ The profit of one, or both?—The small

Who was to receive the profit of the larger

Jane Rickman cross-examined by Mr.
Erskine.

Do you mean to swear that these are two
of the very books that were printed for Sy-
monds and your husband?—lo the best of
my knowledge.

Can you take upon you to swear that these
are part of the copics actually printed for bio,
or may they not have been printed by some-
body else, and be extremely like them? You
have never read tie book thruugh, so as to be
able to say that it isthe same You only see
that this is intituled * A Letter addressed -to
the Addressers ;” but there may be news in
it, for any thing you know ?—I know nothing
about what it contains,

Nor do you know it by the type, the paper,
or any thing about it?—I never saw it till it
was in that state. This pamphict bas my
hand-writing upon it. :

Mr. Attorney General—From whom had
you those books?—Thcy were sent to me
from, I suppuse, Mr. Johnson.

Mr, Erskine.—I submit to your lordsbip,
that this evidence is not sufficient to entitle
them to read these pamphlets. I require, and
Lask no more, that whenever it relates to this
society or that, no matter what bearing it may
have upun the issue of the cause, that the’
should be fixed by the same evidence as woul
be necessary if they were tried tor the publi-
cation of a libel.—I am sure the attorney-ge-
neral will not propose to have a looser proof
in the case of high treasov, than in a misde-
meanor.

Mr. Altorney General] have given no
evidence yet, that I mean to give louse proof
in this cause; Lut I by no means admit the
Proposition to the eatent in which Mr. Erskine
states it.

Thomas Clio Rickman sworn.—Examined by
Mr. Bower.

Look at these two books—Did you publish
one or both of them?—They were printed
with my name.

With your knowledge ?—No—without my
knowledge.

Ilow came they, do you know, to be printed
with your pame—Did you know it at the
time ?—I never did know it, till L was written
to, that that was the case—I was then in th
country. :

At what time did you learn that these books
were printed in. your name?—I think it must
be early in September, 1792.

When you found. that they were printed
with your name, did you make apy applica
tion to any body to know why they were
printed'with your name?—I did. go to Mr.
Jobason about that.

Who, were tu hayg the profit ofthose books?

—That { never knew but what I heard from
my wife.

Thomas Paine, we understand, lodged at
your house ?—He did. .

Did you ever see any of the sheets of those
works while the printing was going on?—No,
not as the printing was going on.

Were any proof-sheets, before the work
was printed, brought to you?—Never.

Look at them, and tell us, whether either
of them were the books that you priated ?—I
did not print the books at all.

Did you publish them ?—-My name was put
to them.

Did you ever sell any of them?—Yes,
many.

: When did you sell any of those books?

Mr. Gibbs.—Do you think that is evidence?
I do not mean to moot the question,

. Mr. Bower.—W hose hand-writing is it upon
that copy ?—My wife's hand-writing, I believe.

Mr. Attoraey General.—In the course of
‘our business, did you ever know of any other

ok intituled “ An Address to the <Ad-
dressers ?”” :

. Mr. Erskine—I am sure this evidence is
very imperfect—no man could be fined five
pounds upon such evidence.

Rickman.—I never saw any book of that
title but this.

Mr. Attorney General.—Are you a member
of the Constitutional Society ?—1 was.

Mr. Erskine—Do you mean to take upon

u to swear that these are two of the identical

ooks that were sent to you for'sale?—I do net.

Mr. Erskine.—They may be exactly like
them, or part like them, and yet be printed by

_ others—lIs there any thing in the paper, or
the type, that can enable you to swear to
“them?—No. 1 know nothing about printing.

Mr. Attorney General.—I should like to
know how you could prove Locke’s Essay upon
Human Understanding otherwise: Is that the
book you sold at your shop as an Address to
the Addressers, when such a book was asked
for?—It was such a kind of book as this.

Look at the matter of the book ?

Mr. Erskine.—Will your lordship allow a
man to look at a book to which he cannot
swear, in order to prove that that is the iden-
tical book ?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—It is not likely
that he should have knowledge enough of the
work to be able to answer the question; but
if he could satisfy us that he knew that this
book contained the identical words that were
in the books that were commonly published
under that title, to this purpose perhaps it
might be evidence.

Mr. Erskine.— Not having the original

book here, could he be permitted to say, I do
not bring the original.book, but ] bring a copy ?
Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—If we could be
Sure it was an exact copy of the same book it
would be the same as the original; they are
all copies.
Mr. Attorney General.—Suppose the Conr


Stitutional Socicty referred to Locke’s Essay
upon the Human Understanding, how is it
possible to identify that book without callin,
the bookseller to prove that that is the boo
which he sells for Locke’s Essay on the
Human Understanding?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—As that would
refer merely to the contents of the book, it
would be very good evidence of the cgntents. *

Mr. Attorney General.—This is what I am
asking to. :

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—yYou certainly
are, but whether he goes to the length of that
is the question.

Mr. Alforney Geaeral.—Is that the boole
you would have sold as the Address to the
Adéressers, by Thomas Paine?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre-—But did he ever
read it?

Myr, Altorney Ggneral—I would not asks
the question, unless | was very well apprized,
according to my information, of what kneow~ ‘
ledge this witness has of it. .

Jord Chiet Justice Eyre.—Go on in yous
own course, 5

Mrs. Attorney Generul.—Do you know the
contents of it?—1 have read the book. , :

Look and see, whether by the conaents of
it that is the book you would sell as the
Address to the Addressers, by Thoma Paine,
if you had been asked by a customer for
Paine’s Address to the Addressers, without
any explanation ?—I should certainly sell this
book as the Letter to the Addressers becausa
it ig so entitled. : .

Look at the contents of it; I will have an
auswer to this if] make you read it through?
—I have certainly read the Letter to the Ad-
dressers.

Look at the contents of the book in you:
hand, and see if the contents are the same as
the Letter to the Addressers which you read ?
—lL have no doubt ot its being the same. ‘

Is it not from the contents that you have:
no doubt ?—No, I confess it is from the com
plexion of the book itself.

You have been told to look at the contents,
now look at the contents.—i bave looked at

post.

Mr. Attorney General.—Put it into the
hands of Mrs. Rickman. Did not you put
them in the shop, and mark them as books
to be sold? :

Mrs. Rickman.—I put my name on them.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—When ?—On
Ziving them to Mr. White.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—In your shop ?—

No.

Mr. Attorney General—You had them in
your shop as books to sell }—I had.

Mr. Erskine.—I understand the Court to be
of opinion (indzed I am not at all disposed to
argue it) that this book must be taken, at
present, to be the Letter addressed to the
Addressers, upon the Proclamation, by
Thomas Paine. What I wish to know, is,
how it is proposed to make this taking it to
be the book it is alleged to be, evidence in this
cause. I perfectly understand why the Rights
of Man were stated to be so, because ‘those
whom this prosecution proposes to implicate
in certain acts—the Corresponding Society,
having come to a resolution to circulate it,
therefore it was fair evidence.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—You had better
hear how they propose to make it evidence.

Mec. Erskine.—1 understand that there is
no evidence yet before the Court of any reso-
lution of either of the societies to circulate
this book, or to recommend it to reading.

Mr. Attorney General.—Y our lordship will

sive me leave to observe, that Mr. Paine has
en proved to be the author of the First Part
of the Rights of Man; the Second Part of the
Rights of Man—the Letter to the French
nation; and I believe (though I am not
accurate about that, because [ was not in
court yesterday morning) a letter to Mr.
ndas.—Mr. Paine is proved to be alsoa
member of the Constitutional Society; Mr.
Rickman, the witness, the person in whose
hands this work was, in order to be sold, is
also proved to be a member of the Constitu-
tional Society. Now, under these circum-
stances, I submit to the Court, that Mr. Paine
and Mr. Rickman being both of them
members of the Constitutional Society, what
one writes for publication, and the other pub-
lishes, is evidence after what has been already
stated.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre,—I cannot myself,
imagine that those facts, which are so perfectly
distinct from the particular subject of this
indictment, can possibly implicate them so as
to make theip publications evidence in this
cause.

Mr. Attorney General.--Then we will make
it evidence in a moment, because I shall now
i to your lordships a resolution in the

ook of the society, for printing part of this
in the Argus, and then I shall read that part
which is printed in the Argus.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—You might read
the whole, and then prove a resolution of the
society for printing a part, because that proves
them cognizant of it, having selected a part,


Mr, Erskine.—K may show a knowledge,
but does not show an aprrobetiant

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Certainly not.

Mr. Attorney General.—I will not trouble
your lordship with this any farther.

Mr. Gurnell.—I found these papers im Ms,
Hardy's house.

Nearl about the same time, I believe.
© Did you ever hear of such a thing as a cat?

es.

What is that? what is the other nanre of
it?—A night-cat, I believe.

What is a night-cat ?-—It stands four ways,
about this shape (describing it.)

Have you seen one?—I have seen the
model of one.

When ?---I cannot recollect; about five or
six weeks before I was taken oP

Had you ever seen such a thing before?
No, never.

What is the use of a night-cat?-—The use
of a T understood, was for acting against the
cavalry. ;

Why, how was a night-cat to act against
cavalry?—I cannot tell.--I have mentioned
all I can tell about it.—I never saw a thing
of that sort before;—that is all I know about it.

You, a Sheffield man, must know how such
a thing as that could hurta horse ?—By throw-
ing it m the streets.

ould it run into his neck, or what other
part ?-~-Into his foot, I should suppose.

William Camage, cross-examined by Mr.
Erskine.

You were asked this question by the counset
for the crown, From what passed amengst the
members, what was the professed object of
this society? To which you answered, a par
liamentary reform?—Yes.

Was that your object when you became a
member of that society ?—Yes.

ee say you were secretary to that society?
—Yes.

From the year 1791, to 1793 ?—Yes.

Will you explain to the gentlemen of the
jury, when you became a member of this
society, in order to obtain a parliamertary
reform: You were asked, what z
among the different members? What was
their object? What sort of parliamentary
reform was it, that you fairly, as a man,
meant ?—A more equal representation of the
people.

A more equal representation of the people,
where ?—In parliament.

In what branch of parliament?—In the
House of Commons.

Had you any idea by a parliamentary re-
form, in your own inind, when you ea
member, or when you continued’ there, to
touch the king’s majesty, or the House of
Lords?—No, never.—I never had that idea.

Never in your life ?—No.

- Task you in the presence of God, to whom
you will answer, hall you any idea of destroy-
in ihe king, or the House of Lords?—No, God
forbid.

Had you ever, in the whole course of your
being a member of that society, and a secre-
tary, from any proceedings of the assembly,
from what passed among the members, from
what they said and did a follow the question
which the counsel correctly put) ; had you apy
reason to think that any of them meant
differently from yourself?—No, never—not
an hiss amongst the whole society.

Then F understand you to say, upon the oath
you have taken, and subject to the conse-
quences here and hereafter, that there was no
such idea either in your own wind, or from
what you knew from others, what they said
and what they did,-in the mind of any other
of the members ?—Never.

When you said that the resolve was not to
petition parliament, did you mean not to pe-
tition it at that time, or never to petition it,
when the sentiments of the people at large
could be known ?—I cannot dpesk to that—
There was no specific plan ever pointed out,
by what-means redress should be obtained.

Was it ever pointed out, or from any thing
which passed in your presence during all your
attendance, that this change in the represen-
tation of the people in the House of Commons
was to be carried by force of arms and vio-
lence ?—No, never.

If you had had an idea that the members of
your society, or of other societies in the differ-
ent parts of the kingdom, meant by combin-
ing force to over-rule the inclinations of the
people at large, and the inclinations of the

arliament, would you have continued a mem-

er of it?—No, I would not.
Task you, under the solemnity of the oath
which you are under, to say, whether you
ever heard any thing said, or saw any thing
done, that led you to believe, or to suspect,
that that was the intention of your society ?—
No, never.

Did | you eyer hear any thing said, or see any
thing done, which led you to suspect, that it
was the intention, even of any mischievous
individuals among you?—No; I never sus-
pected it; I never cause to suspect any
one.

If you had had an idea, independently of
force, that the object you were about might
ultimately have affected the safety and ho-
nour of your sovereign upon the throne, would
you have continued in that society ?—No; I
would not.

You say you continued secretary ull the year
1793.—Did you read with attention, all that you
signed?—or did you take it on trust, from the
opinion you entertained of the general objects
of the society, that it was all as it ought to be?
—I generally read it before I signed it ;—I
do not know that Lever signed a letter till I
had read it. .

Did you continue to be a member after you
ceased to be secretary?—I did. ,

_ Did you continue to be a member.up to the
time when you were taken up ?—I did.

Did you see any reason, before the time
you were taken up, tu.change your.sentiments
concerning the opinions of those with whom
you associated ?—I did not.

Have you had any reason to believe,—I ask
you to look in upon your own soul, when you
answer the question,—.that, though they might
uot intend mischief originally when associated,
ri began to intend mischief?—No: I never


‘When was it that your meetings began to
be threatened with joterruption?—It was
about the month of April, I fancy ; as near as
i can guess, the beginning of April or March,

794,

Do you remember the time when-the con-
vention was to meet in Edinburgh ?—Yes.

Was there any thing proposed by the so-
ciety of which you were a member, or did yqu
ever hear any thing said, or see any thing
done to the effect, that this convention was to
put down the king, and the upper House, and
to be itself the king and the parlisment ?—
Never.

Did it ever enter into your conception, that
this convention was to make laws for the
public, or perform the functions of any part of
the state?—No, I never understood it so.

‘Was it then to consider, what would be the
best means in a legal manner to effect a
change in the representation of the people in
the House of Commons ?—By petitioning par-
liament, at the meeting of the Scotch Conven-
tion; that was the idea that the Sheffield So-
ciety had at that time.

Whether it was not universally said, among
your society (I am following Mr. Law's ques-
tion) that, though a petition from a small
number ofindividusls would be neglected, and
therefore you laid aside petitioning, whether
it was not the general declarations,—I am
not speaking of men’s secret ideas, but as far
as they were manifested,—that when you had
got the sentiments of a great number of a
respectable part of the people, and were then
to petition, at a convention, that the House of
Commons would attcnd to your petition,
though they would not attend to a petition
from a small body of men ?—Yes.

Was that your idea?—At that time it was.

Was that, upon your oath, what you col-
lected to be the gencral sentiments of the
peeple ?—Yes, it was; and my own ideas.

Were you, while you continued a member
of the society, and up to the time that you
were taken up, really a friend to the British
constitution, in its purity ?—Yes, I was.

Had you any wish to bring into England,
the desolations and the’anarchies that are in
France ?—No, never.

Had you a wish to see the king put down
from his throne, we will not even talk of his
death, but had you a wish to see the king,
and the royal family, put down from their
state and dignity?—No; God forbid that I
should ever live to see it.

Should not you have Saxahe yourself the
most wicked and abandoned of mankind, if
you had remained an hour in that society, if
you had thought that the wish of that society?
‘“—Yes; I should bave thought so.

Did you, from what you saw, or from what
you beard, syspect that to be behind the
curtain, and the intentions of those people,
though they expressed themselves differently?

Mr. Garrow.—I must beg to object to that
question; it is for the jury, what this may

i suspected was behind the curtain,

Mr. ‘Attorney General.—I certainty will

not object to it.—I desire to be understood,
‘that I, by ao means, agree that it is a question
«that could he put, unless I consented to it.
Mr Erskine—And 1 am much more
“pleased to’ accept it, upon the attorney-
general's declaration now, than tu argue the
“point, whatever might be my own opinion
concerning it—Then, fron what you ob-
‘served, saw, and heurd, had you any reason
to believe then, or do you now believe, that,
though the papers that were signed carried
“upon the faces of them parliamentary reform,

as you have expresged it, that there was an |

‘intention, in point of fact, to destroy the
constitution of Great Britain?—No; I never
had reason, in my life, to believe any such
thing.

. You say, for the first time, you began to be
interrupted in your proceedings, in 1793 ?—
Yes.

What were the nature of the threats you

“received, and what were you afraid of?’—We |

“were afraid of the opposite party making an

attack upon us in our meetings, or out of
doors.

What do you mean by the opposite party?
the king and parliament? or the eople of
Sheffield, of a different opinion >The people
in Sheffield, of a different opinion.

' You were afraid of the opposite party, of
the people who thought differently from you,
that they intended to persecute you?—Yes.

Did you believe, at the time you were
threatened to be interrupted, that you were
doing what was legal? — Yes; we be-

ews we were duing every thing that was
‘legal.

Did you, for one, believe you were doin
what was legal ?—Yes ; I did not know that
was committing any thing that was wrong.
I never heard that any thing was not right.

What was the nature of the apprehension
that you had, at the time that Mr. Yorke
Proposed your having arms to defend your-
selves?—The opinion I had was, that the
people, if they meant to attack us, would do

‘It be etee ot arms themselves.
hat people ?—The opposite party to us
in Sheffield.” si id

Had you any other intention, or from all
that you heard in your society, from Mr.
Yorke himself, or any body in your society,
that any other use was intended to be made

‘of these three dozen of pikes, or any thing
else you had, but merely to defend yourselves?
—Nothing else.

Do you believe, from any thing you heard
or saw, that it was in the contemplation of
any body to employ these pikes, or any other
arms, against the king and the parliament ?—
‘No; never.

Would you have remained an hour in that
society, if you had any reason to see, that that
was the use intended to be made of those
arms ?—No, I would not. '
" Pid you believe—I am not asking you the


law, for you cannot be supposed to know any
thing of the law—Did you believe that you
had a right to arms for your defence, under
the law of your country?—I did believe [
had

ad.

Under what law ?—By the Bill of Rights.

Was that the manner in which the right
to have these arms was debated in your
society ?—I do not remember any debate.

But was any thing said about your right to
have arms, if you were attacked by malicious
people?—We thought we had a right to
detend ourselves, founded upon the Bill of
Rights, against any of those people that might
attack us.

Mr. Attorney General—Who told you that
you had that right?—I have heard Mr. Yorke
say so.

‘Mr. Erskine.—Was it ever debated amongst
you, that if you were commanded by the
whole authority of the state, that you were to
raise arms amongst the people to support the
authority of your convention as 3 parliament?
—No; I never heard that debated.

Was there ever any hint that the laws
were to be made by those twenty or thirty
people at Edinburgh?—No; I never heard
any such thing.

What did you consider these people at
Edinburgh were to do, who were a convention
from these different societies ?—I cannot
speak to what their business was when met
together,

Were they to consider what were the best
means to go on, in a legal and peaceable
manner, to obtain a parliamentary reform ?—
I supposed so; I understood it so. .

Did you know Mr. Hardy ?—I never did.

Did you really think, that you were com
tending for rights that rendered more secure,
and more permanent, the king's title?—I{
did; I always looked upon it as such.

Do you recollect why that particu
‘species of arms was rccommended, or apy
thing said about these pikes?—I believe it
was the cheapness of the article.

You saw a model of this cat —Yes.

Were you an inhabitant of Sheffield at that
time ?—Yes.

Did’ you ever see such a thing, or know
that there was any one made fromm that
model ?—No; I never did.

Did you ever see such a one in the king-
dom or Great Britain ?-—The person I gotit
of said he had seen such things, many years
before, at Newcastle.

But you never saw, nor none of your
socicty, to your knowledge, ever saw any
instrument ‘made after this model?—No;
Not that I'know of.

William Camage re-examined by Mr.
Attorney General.

You say this man told you he had seed
some of these night-cats at Newcastle?—

Yes.
Did he tell you at what time, in the history

of his life, he had seen them there ?—It was |
during his life time. . .

Was it at any particular period of the his-

tory of the country, did he tell you?---No; he
did not mention the year he had seen them
in.
You know what I inean perfectly well.—
Did he tell you what was going on in the
country, at the time he saw them at New-
castle?--I do not recollect that he did.---I
think he said it was some time about the
American war ;—about the close of it.

You say you expected opposition from the
other party, at Sheftield?--Yes.

How came you and Davison to send a
letter about sending pikes to London, in
order to oppose the other party at Shetheld ?-—
It was Davison sent the letter.

So Davison sent a letter to London about
pikes, you thinking they were to oppose the
other party at Sheffield ?--He might have the
same views in it for the people of London, as
for the people at Sheftield. :

You have talked about cavalry: what were
the opposite party at Sheffield, who were
to attack you with cavalry ?—-I do not know.
_ Why what cavalry was this night-cat for?
+-It was only a model of one; I never saw
any made; it was never to be put in execu-
ton. ~
. How came you to talk about cavalry ?—-
it was when he was talking about the use
of it,

Your opinion was about the opposite party
at Sheffield, and Davison’s opinion, of course,
about the opposite party in London ?-—Yes.

That is what he calls the bare-faced aristo-
cracy of the present administration ?—He
called it so.

What did you understand by that, when he
showed you this letter, before he sent it to
London, about the pikes, upon your oath ?-—~

only, upon my oath, understood that he
Meant the opposite party.

Why this Davison, who meant as little as
you did, was not so bold as you, for he ran
mney a fortnight before you were taken up?
—Yes. :

How came he to do that?—I believe he

of some persons being in Sheffield;
that was the report.
_ And so he thought so little about this
innocent thing of the opposite party, that he
Tan away ?-—I cannot give any other reason.

You told us that the cheapness of the
article was the reason why you thought of
pikes?-Yes,

How much was the handle and the blade
to cost ?-Twenty- pence, I believe.

So that thirteen-pence would not pay for
them?—The hoop and the blade would come
to that by themselves.

If the blade and the hoop had come to
London, at the price of one shilling, there
Would be some more expence to pay, that
somebody else must provide for?—Yes;
there would be the shaft to it.

| ders


‘Did you ever hear of such a place as the
Parrot, in Green Arbour Alley, London ?—=
No; I did not.

Never ?—-No; I never did.

Had you any conversation with Davison
about these pikes, after he showed you this
letter?—I do not recollect that I had any
conversation with him at the time.

But after?---No; not that I can bring to
my recollection what it was.

William Broomhead sworn.—Examined by Mr.
Garrow.

You reside at Sheffield, I believe?-~Yes,

What are you by business ?-—A cutler.

Were you a member of any society at
Sheffield, which had the name of the Constie
tutional Society ?~-Yes.

At what time did you become a member of
it?—At the first institution of the society, I
think in the year 1791, when the society was
first instituted.

Were you one of twelve of that society
which were afterwards associated with the
Constitutional Society of London ?—I was not
then a member of any committee, nor did 1
act in any public character.

That is not the question that I put to you ;
I ask, whether at any time you became an
associated member of a society in London,
called the Constitutional Society ?—I never
was a member of the Constitutional Society it
London.

I did not ask you whether you were of not,
but whether you were one of the twelve of
the Sheffield Society who were associated with
the Constitutional Society in London?—We
were above twelve when that society was
wrote to, and therefore I do not understand
the question. * .

I will explain the question to you: your
society at Sheffield were more numerous than
twelve?—Yes.

And when you were more numerous than
twelve, the Constitutional Society in London
were written to by your society—do you agree
so far with me?—Yes.

Did your society, when you wrote to the
other society, port any names of persons
to be associated with the society in London?
—I never heard that subject spoken of, nor
any letter to that purpose.

bia you know whether you, or any other
persons of the Sheffield Society, were received
as associated members of the Constitutional
Society in London?—I do not recollect an
such persons being constituted a member
the Constitutional Society in London; I do
not recollect; I have no knowledge of any
such matter.

Do I understand you right, that you do
recollect such a prepeson moving from
your society to the London Society ?—Letters
were wrote from oné society to the other.

Proposing such a measure?—I understood
that they acted in conjunction; I always un-
00d it as such,

Did I understand you right, that one of the |

modes by which that acting in conjunction
was to be brought about, was, that a certain
number of your society should be associated
with the London Constitutional Society, for
the purposes of general conjunctive acting ?—
I do not know that any such subject was ever
settled; I know no farther of the junction of
the society but what passed by letter.

Did you at any time act as a secretary to
the society at Shetlield?—Yes, about five
months.

Was that the five months last before you
were apprehended ?—Yes.

When were you apprehended ?—I think in
May last.

Be so good as tell us for what purpose your
Constitutional Society were assembled, and
what the professed object of their assembling
was ?—The object was a parliamentary reform.

By what means was that reform fo be
effected ?—By meeting and endeavouring to
enlighten each other, and spread the know-
ledge both of the grievances which we consi-

dered to exist, or which were frequently '
wrote of and spoken of, and informing the ;

people of the necessity of a reform, that they

might unitedly move for it in the best and |

most unexceptionable mode.

Was there any peculiar mode by which the
election of meant to the House of Commons
was to be effected, according to your proposi-
tion as to the right of voting?—That subject
was never discussed to my knowledge.

Are you acquainted with the expression—
universal suffrage ?—I expect I am.

Was it or not the scheme of the Constitu-
tional Society at Sheffield, that a reform was
to be produced by universal sutfrage?—It
never was, as far as my recollection of it; it
never was until the Edinburgh Convention ; I
nae heard of universal suffrage until that

ime.

Was the circumstance of the Edinburgh
Convention known to the Constitutional So-
ciety at Sheffield >—They sent a delegate, and
therefore certainly they must know it.

Who was their delegate at the convention
at Edinburgh ?—Matthew Campbell Brown ;
but Iwas not secretary at that time; they
called upon me to take upon me the secreta-
ryship just after he was gone to Edinburgh.

Do you know a person of the name of. Veucy
Yorke?—I know a person who goes by that
name.

Perhaps you know him by another name?
—I have heard another name.

What is it?—Henry Redhead.

And who likewise goes by the name. of
Yorke ?—Yes,

Did Yorke or Redhead ever reside at Shef-
ficld ?—Several times he has been at Sheffield.

Did he reside there for any time ?—This
last time I do not exactly know how long;
may be six weeks, or seven or eight weeks.

Do you know a person of the name of Gale,
a printer at Shefficld?—Very well,


Mr. Yorke was not a settled inhabitant of
Sheffield, was he ?—No.

Did he attend the meetings of the Consti-
tutional Society at Sheffield?—He attended
almost every weekly meeting during his last
visit to Shetheld.

As he was not a settled inhabitant of Shef-
| field, in what character did Mr. Yorke, during
his last visit, attend regularly the weekly
Meetings of the society !—They, considering
him as a man of considerable abilities, and as
an orator, paid great respect to him, and he
used to attend constantly onee a week at the
meeting which was called the committce ; but
jt was not properly acommittee, for the time
of the expiration of the committee which was
before, was clapsed, and another was not
chose, and such persons who had been on the
committee were admitted principally on ac
count of Mr. Yorke being at Shefheld.

You have given me a guod reason why he
should be treated with respect when he was
there; that he was a man of talents and an
orator; but I ask in what character he came
there ?—I am totally unacquainted with tbat,
for he did not bring any letter to us; I have
: heard say
Did you ever hear him himself say ?—No;
| never hadany conversation with him uponit

You never heard from himself then in what
character he came there ?—No.

_ But being there, you discovered be had
great talents, and was an orator ?—Yes.

Did he take any part in the management
of the business of the society ?—He wrote
several pamphlets while at Sheffield, and at
several times brought some part, if not the
whole of these pamphlets, in manuscript, ta
these meetings to be read.

Do you speak now of the weekly mectings,
which were improperly called committees?—
Yes.

Where were these mectings held 2—At my
house.

You had a commodious room there pro-
bably ?—It was a small room where these
mectings met, but there was a large room
when a great number met.

The meeting was improperly called a com-
mittee, when they met in a small room ?— Yes

How often was the other room used?-~
Some two, three, or four times; I do not re-
collect how many during bis last visit.

Was there in that room any preparation for
the more commodious exercise of the talents
of oratory of Mr. Yorke?—Yes.

What ?—A little matter erected to elevate
the speaker.

What was that called, that we may have 3
name to put down in our notes?—Some called
it one thing, some called it another,

What did you call it, for instance?—I never
called it any-thing. .

What was the more general name for it ip
the society ?—Some called it the pulpit, some
the tribune, but it never was christened.
| ' But it was a commadious elevation for the


orator, and some called it a pulpit, others a
tribune ?—Yes.

And from this tribune Mr. Yorke addressed
the society ?—He did. -

Besides those meetings, improperly called
committees, and those meetings in which the
tribune was, do you remember any meeting
upon the Castle-hill?—Very well.

Was that of the date of the 7th of April ?—
I do not justly recollect the day, but I was
there.

Was Mr. Yorke there ?—Yes. . .

Did he there exercise himself in addressing
the people ?—Yes.

In what sort of manner and Janguage ?—
He had a book in his hand wrote by Locke,
and he expatiated very largely on the corrup-
tion that had crept into the English constitu-
tion, or rather the evils which generally are
complained of, and showed there was a devia-
tion, in some degree, from the original consti-
tution of Great-Britain; but his manner of
speaking may sometimes lead him to go
farther than he ought.

Did that unfortunate fatality upon this
occasion occur, that he did go farther than in
your judgment he ought?—It was agreed upon
that I should make a motion.

First answer my question ; did it appear to
you that his address that had Locke’s book
for its text, was more violent, and went
farther than it ought ?—He is peculiarly ener-
getic, and at the same time very fiery, very
warm, very strong; but at this meeting I do
not know that he said any thing that was
detrimental to the constitutional law of Eng-
Jand—not at this meeting.

It was settled, you said, that you were todo
something—settled by whom?—By Mr. Yorke
and Mr. Gale, at a meeting previous.

At one of the committees ?—Yes; that I
should make a motion for a petition to the
House of Commons, for a reform in the re-
presentation of the people.

For what purpose were you to make that
motion as it was settled ?—That it might be
over-ruled.

Was it settled at the committee before-hand
then, that a motion should be made that it
might be over-ruled ?—Yes, it was so agreed
upon, and further for the purpose of introduc-
ing sunther: motion in its place.

id you make the motion as it had been
agreed ?—I did, for petitioning the House of
Commons.

What was done upon your making that
motion?—It was objected to with a view of
making way for another, which was brought
in and carried.

Whom was it objected to by; who was the
atiecior ?-—-There were only four of us, the
other member I do not at present recollect: it
was either Henry Yorke, Joseph Gale, or
William Camage.

“You mean there were only four of the
committee that attended?—lIn the elevation


Theré was an elevation then upon the Cas-
tle-hill?—Yes, one of those things we called
the tribune was carried upon the Castle-hill.

Then one of these persons opposed your mo-
tion ?—Yes.

What number of persons might there be
assembled at this meeting ?—Several thou-
sands. ,

A meeting in the open air ?—Yes.

And then one of these persons opposed your
motion, as it had been agreed, for the intro-
duction of another ?—Yes. ;

What was the substance of that other mo-
tion?—Instead of petitioning the House of
Commons to petition his majesty, and a peti-
tion was drawn up ; the parchments lay at my
house. —_—

Drawn up by whom ?— enry Yorke or
Redhead. Pe a “J

Was it before or after the meeting in the
open air, that it was drawn up?—Perhaps it’
might be drawn up before, and read there: I
think it was, but it was not signed till after.

Then it was left at your house for signa.’
tures ?—It was. .

Upon the occasion of the introducing this
amendment upon your proposition, did Mr.
Yorke address the meeting, composed, as you
say, of some thousands ?—Yes, he addressed’
them: he introduced that subject of petition
ing the king to exercise his power for a re-
form in the representation of the people, and
this petition was sent up to London to earl
Stanhope, but he did not think proper to pre-
sent it in that form.

Do you remember a day or two after the
ineeting upon the Castle-hill, being in com-
pany with Gale and Yorke at your house,’
when any application was made to Yorke upon
the subject of the speech he had delivered to
the people upon the Castle-hill; do you re-'
member any application to him a day or two
afterwards, upon the subject of printing his’
speech?—I remember something being said
to him upon it at my house.

Did he agrce to print his speech?—To the
best of my recollection, he did.

Was it printed ?—It was.

Did you see it afterwards in print ?—Yes.

From having heard it upon the Castle-hill,
could you form an opinion, whether the print-
ed copy which you saw afterwards, was a
pretty accurate statement of what passed ?—

The substance of the matter he delivered
there, I believe it contains.

Was that publistied at Sheffield?—Yes.

Do you believe this to be one of those pub-
lications [ showing it to the witness]?—I do.

Did you receive afterwards from Yorke, any
number of these pamphlets for any purpose?’
—I did not receive them from Yorke, but I re-
ceived them at Gale’s shop. :

Did you do any thing with them by the di-
rection of Yorke ?—It was by the direction of :
the meeting, previous to their being commu-—
nicated to different persons. .

Do you mean the general meeting, or the _

private meeting ?—The private meeting di-
rected they should be communicated to dif-
ferent persons.

Did you, in consequence, make up any pac-
kets of them, and do you believe these to be
two of the packets [showing them to the wit-
ness]?—They are: they are directed to me
according to order.

How many might you direct in that manner
in separate packages?—I do not recollect ex-
actly, there might be twenty-four, or more.

What was done with these, after you had
made them up separately, and addressed them
to the different persons ?—They were lapped
up and directed to certain persons, and then

ut together in a box.

to whom were they sent!—To the best of
my recollection they were sent to Thomas

dy.

What was your situation in life before you
were applied to to become the secretary of
this society ?—I was a cutler.

Were you working at your business?—Yes,
when I had any business to work at.

Were you applied to to become the secre-
tary, or did you apply for it?—I was applied
to

. By whom ?—By one of the members, John
Alcock.
¥ Were you paid anything for your trouble ?—

es.

What was your inducement to take that of-
fice upon you?—I should not have taken it
upon me, if I had not been applied to.

What induced you to do it?7—The war de-
stroyed my business.

. Am J to understand that you did it to in-
crease your means of support ‘—I did.

Did it come to your knowledge, in your
character as a member of the society, or
atherwise, that there were any preparations
of arms of any sort at Sheffield ?—I heard re-
ports as other peuple might do, but purposely
avoided meddling, in thought or act, with any
matter of that sort.

Did you in the society, or from the mem-

bers of the society, bear of any proposition for:

providing arms, or that any were 1n prepara-
tion ?—I did, and it is proper that this should
be well explained.

Eapisis that.—A few days before this meet-
ing, when it was spoken to as being the right
of Baglshmen to have in their power means
of defence, a hand-bill, a spurious hand-bill
was published in Sheffield, with an intention
to provoke the society to some unjustifiable
measures, and it was spoke to in the meeting,
that it was their right to have them in their
own defence, and Joseph Gale spoke to it; he
was the man. This wicked hand-bill was not
signed by any magistrate; it was throwed
about the town in the dark; it caused an agi-
tation in the minds of the people, and it was

ke of as being the right of every individual
shee, to have such and such arms accordin;
to their rights, lest any tumult or riot should
break out. I am happy to speak of this, and


[608

T should be happy to see that advertisement,
with what was said at this meeting, which
ioe published in the Sheffield paper the week
after.

Was this hand-bill distributed previous to
the meeting upon the Castle-hill?—To the
best of my recollection it was after that meet-

ing.

Was the subject of procuring arms publicly
discussed or in the private meetings of the so-
ciety ?—It was at a public meeting Mr. Gale
spoke of our rights.

A meeting in your large room ?—Yes.

A public meeting of the society ?—Yes.

By the society only?—There were manv
others that were not members there, as well
as others.

How did they come? were they introduced
by memhers?—The tickets were not regularly
delivered, I believe, at that time.

Then members introduced visitors ?—Yes.

Did you see any arms, or any model of
any ?—I never saw a pike ull I saw one when
I was brought to London.

Whatsort of arms were they that were talk-
ed of, as fit to be had for the pugposes stated?
—Pikes were talked of, but r mever saw one
till _I was brought to London,

I do not know whether you heard any thing
of the night-cats ?—I saw a model of one, but
it was only like the play-thing of a child.

Now we will have an account of the manner
in which children play at Sheffield, what sort
of an instrument was it?—A little instrument
standing up with a point about one inch high.

One of the Jury.—It was in a ball was it
not?—No.

Mr. Garrow.-—Ithad four cross points?

Juryman.—Were there only four of these?
—I think there were four.

Mr. Garrew.—So that if you threw it down
it always presented a point.—That did.

How long is that point?—This was about
three quarters of an inch.

Only made just to show what the sort of
thing was?—Yes.

Was there any other purpose for which
these instruments were spoken of in the so
ciety to be made, except playing with them as
children ?—Never any mention made of them
in the society at all.

Where did you see the model ?—<At the
house of one Benjamin Dunn.

Was he a member of the society ?—Yes, but
it was not he that produced it. .

Who produced it at his house ?—I think
they call him Charles Rhodes. —

Had you ever seen such a thing before?—
I never did. :

You neturally were led to ask its use and
the purpose for which it was to be constructed,
What was stated to be the purpose of this
play thing?—I do not recollect any conversi
tion upon that head, but it was taken
thrown upon the floor.

Was that act of throwing it on the floor, and
of course its presenting one of its points a

companied by no description of the use it
might be applied to, besides playing with it?
—What might be said that night might not
be serious. .

When talking of a play thing one is not se-
rious; now, serious or not, what was said of
it ?—Nothing was said, but he brought it to’
show them.

What was said, serious or not serious, as to
the use to which that might or could or was
intended to be applied?—I cannot call to
mind any thing that was said, but this only,
that he came to show them that such a little
boy, whose name he mentioned, had made it,
and showed it them.

Was it called by any name?—I heard no
name of it till I came to London, there it was
called a Cat.

A night Cat, or day Cat, or any thing of
that kind ?—I heard no name whatever.

Was there any conversation at that time
when it was thrown upon the floor about
Cavalry ?—I do not recollect any conversation
eal but merely the throwing it upon the

oor.

You said just now that the conversation,
such as it was, might not be serious?—No,

laughing at it.
pon your oath was there any conversation
Serious or not with respect to Cavalry or the
town of Newcastle?—Newcastle was not
mentioned there, it was not at the same place
I apprehend.

Where was it that there was conversation
about the town of Newcastle ?—I know no-
thing about any conversation about New-
castle.

Upon your oath were you never present
when that model was produced, and when
there was a conversation about Newcastle ?—
Upon my oath I never was.

Then you never heard any conversation at
Sheffield about this night-cat or this model
of a night-cat with respect to cavalry ?—I do
not recoilect any conversation about its use
but a mere trifling, desultory, pleasing, irre-
gular conversation with one another.

Now that trifling, pleasing, desultory, irre-
gular conversation I want to have—I am
sure I cannot reccllect it; if I could recollect
it I would.

‘Try,do not hurry yourself —I cannot recol-
lect any thing that was said, only his taking it
out of his pocket, showing it us, and throwing
it on the floor; there was no regular conver-
sation, no debate whatever about it.

And the nature of the desultory observa-
tions that were made you do not recollect ?—
He showed it to the company as being the
production of a boy, a child, I remember that
perfectly well.

Et was a thing that you had never seen
any thing like before ?—I believe I never had.

You contented yourself with seeing it
thrown down, and looking at one of its
points?—I had nothing to do with it what-
ever.



You tokl me that at the meetings at the
Castle-hill, Mr. Yorke, though in general
warm and energetic, and disposed to say
strong things, did not say any hing that was
detrimental to the cunstitutional law of Eng-
land, were you present at any other meet-
ing where his speeches were not quite of
that character ?—I have been present at other
meetings when he has not been so well guarded
as he was at that meeting.

Perhaps those might be meetings of the
society only ?-—So called, of the society only.

But with visitors admitted, be so good as
tell us the tendency of his discourses when
he rather gave himself liberty, when he
followed the impulse of his nature? —If I
had noted them down, I might have been
able to have repeated them.

I do not expect you should give us them in
his manner or precise words, but give us the
substance and effect of those expressions
which appeared to you to be unguarded ?—F
do not justly recollect at present.

Endeavour to recollect >—I may have heard
him when conversing in those meetings,
sometimes he was very warm to be sure, and
might drop unguarded expressions.

Such as what unguarded expressions ?—
Comparing what he looked upon to be the
grievances under which .we laboured, with
the privileges which Englishmen once en-

Jjoved, he might step out of the way.

What expressions did he use which ap-
peared to you to be unguarded ?—I heard him
use one expression,—but for my own part I
will not presume to puta comment upon it,-—
he expressed himself to this purport, that we
were in a low despicable situation, and rather
than submit he would go up to London with
the people there present. a:

Who were we ?—We Englishmen were in
such a condition, that rather than subm® to
it he would go up to London with the people
there present, but he did not say for what.

How many were the people present with
whom Mr. Yorke was to come up rather than
to submit to the degraded state in which the
people of England were?—There might be
perhaps 150, or perhaps 200.

Was this at one of the meetings of the s0-
ciety ?—With some others. -

One of the general meetings ?—Yes.

Composed of members of the society and
of others? —Yes. .

One of the Jury.—He would go up with
them to London, and what then?—He did
not draw any inference.

Mr. Garrow. — Was that after you had
heard any thing upon the subject of arming?
—I think it was before; to the best of my
memory it was before that, but Iam not per- ~
fectly clear in that. . :

Was that delivered from the tribune?
Delivered from the place which was sometimes
called so, and sometimes called a pulpit.

It was from the orator’s elevation that this
speech was delivered ?-—-Yes,

2R

Perhaps having brought that to your me-
mory may enable you to recollect some other
accompanying expressions ?—I do uot recol-
lect any other that gave me any pain at the
time, what was the cause of my remembering
that, was the pain I felt at the time.

What was it that occasioned any sensation
of pain in you at that declaration of Mr.
Yorke?—Why, I fear God and honour the
king.

And therefore you felt pain at that declara-
tion of Mr. Yorke?—Yes.

Now, either at that or any other of these

meetings, do you recollect any of these ex-
pressions of Mr. Yorke®—I do not recollect
any expressions that so struck me as that.
. Ido not know whether you have seen this
paper before? [showing the witncss a printed
paper]—I never saw this, but I saw one from
which this was taken.

Have you seen a pamphlet of which you
believe that to be one copy 2—Yes.

Look at this [showing the witness another
pines pamphlet,“ the fast-day as observed at

heffield” ] have you seen that before ?—I have.

Do you remember the circumstance of a
proclamation for a general fast to be held the
8th February, 1794 ?—Yes.

In what manner was that fast observed
upon the Castle-hill at Sheffield ?—It was not
at the Castle-hill.

Where was it?—At the top of the town in
another place.

In the open air ?—Yes.

Were you there?—I was.

What number of persons do you think
might be assembled for the purpose of ob-
serving that fast?—Not so many.—

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.— How is that
evidence.

Mr. Attorney General.—Your lordship will
recollect that we read a resolution from the
books of the Constitutional Society, thanking
the people of Sheffield for the manner in
which they had spent the fast-day.

Mr. Garrow.—With this addition, that the
printed paper in my hand was found in the
prisoner’s possession.

Broomhead.—I cannot ascertain the num-
ber, but there were not so Many as upon the
Castle-hill.

About how many do you think might be
assembled?—I cannot tell properly, there
might be a thousand or two.

.Tell us the manner in which you, together

- with that assembly of a thousand or two, ce-
lebrated that fast ; is the manner in which it
is represented in this printed paper that I
showed to you correct?—To the best of my
knowledge It is.

What might the number of your society
properly so called amount to?—Nearly 600,
more or less.

Are you divided into divisions?—Such a
mode has been advised, but was not regularly

kept.
By whom had that mode been advised ?—


I do not recullect because that was advised, I
believe, before I was a member.

Do you think that 600 was the ful] amount
of the members of your society at its greatest
extent; do you believe it ever amounted to
2,000?—No such thing, because I wrote the
tickets down.

The distribution into divisions or sections
was not regularly executed ?—No.

What was done towards that ?—There were
a kind of books delivered, called district
books ; they were not regularly attended to,
that is all T can say about it.

What was the object of the distribution of
these district books, where did they issue
from ?—They were printed by Joseph Gale.

By whose directions ?—They were printed
before I joined them.

Were the society’s books printed by Gale,
one of your members a printer at Sheftield;
—Yes.

To what persons were they distributed, and
for what purpose ?—The members of the so-
ciety, divined into as we may term them sec-
tions, they were called districts.

What was to be the mode in which these
districts of the society, were to assemble’
themselves? — They were to meet if i
thought proper, to collect pennies a wee
principally, a penny a week from each
member. .

Were there any regular periods at which
the several sections or divisions were to com
municate in one general assembly, or was
that left to an emergency ?—Such a thing
was mentioned, but it never was executed.

What was mentioned, but not executed ?—
About these persons meeting to whom the
book was delivered, but it was never put in
practice.

So that the district meetings were not so
regularly attended to, if 1 understand you, as
the general meetings of the society ?—No,
not properly attended to.

Mr. Edward Lauzun called.

Look at these pamphlets (the fast-day as
observed at Sheffield, and a serious lecture),
where did you find them?—E found bo
these in Mr. Hardy’s house.

Mr. Garrow to William Broomhead. After
the serious lecture was read, there was ahymn
prepared I believe ?—Yes.

Who prepared that hymn ?—Gale printedit-

Who composed it?—I believe it was com-
posed by one Montgomery.

That was sung in full chorus by the whole
assembly ?—Yes it was sung.

By whose order were these two pamphlets
printed and published ?—I believe they were
printed by Joseph Gale.

By whose order, and at whose expense i—
They were sold.

But there is an expense incurred, in print
ing and publishing before the sale reim-
burses?—Joseph Gale did not receive any
money before the sale.


Who ordered it to be printed ?—I believe ! mer, Skirving, Margarot, and Gerrald; also

it was a private matter.

Who. furnished the copy to Gale?—I do
not know for certain.

Who read the lecture?—A gentleman from.
Halifax.

Do you know of any proceedings of the so-
ciety, of the committee, or of Yorke, respect-
ig pang and publishing these two pam-
phlets ?—I do not recollect any at present.

Were they in general distributed through
the town of Sheffield ?—They were sold.

Do you know of your own knowledge whe-
ther the sale was extensive or not?—I think
not very extensive.

There is a prayer, who composed that, do
you know ?—Myself.

Whom was that delivered by? —By myself.

From notes, or extempore ?—It was extem-

pore.

You had written it, and committed it to
memory, perhaps ?~Yes,

What became of the copy ?—lIndeed, I do
not know; I took no account of it; it was de-
livered to be printed.

_ By whose directions?—I do not recollect ;
it was at a private meeting that that was
spoken of.

A private meeting of what ?—Several mem-
bers of the society.

Tell me, if you know their names, John
Paine, of Newhill?—-I have heard the name,
but I do not know the person.

Was hea member of the society ?—I believe
he might be.

Mr. Garrow.—It is in evidence, that he
was one of those sent up by their secretary to
the London society.

You know Joseph Gale ?—Yes.

He was a member?—Yes.

And Joseph Smith ?—Yes.

And David Martin ?—Yes.

Mr. Garrow.—It is not worth while going
through the names; they were sent up to the
Constitutional Society, to be affiliated with
them, which is proof that they were members.

Extracts read from a printed pamphlet, inti-
tuled, “« Proceedings of the Public Mect-
ing, held at Sheffield, in the open air, on
the 7th of April, 1794 ;” and also an “ Ad-
dress to the British Nation, being an
Exposition of the Motives which have de-
termined the Pcople of Sheffield to peti-
tion the House of Commons no more on
the Subject of Parliamentary Reform.
Printed for the Sheffield Constitutional
Society.”

“ Proceedings of the Public Meeting.

“ In pursuance of a public advertisement, a
alge meeting of the Friends of Justice, Li-

erty, and Humanity, was held, at three
o'clock on Monday, the 7th of April, 1794, on
the Castle-hill, in Sheffield, to consider upon
the propriety of addressing the king, in behalf
of the persecuted patriots, citizeas Muir, Pal-

of again petitioning the House of Commons
for a reform in the representation of the peo-
ple, and to determine upon the propriety of
peutioning the king, for the total and unqua-
ified abolition of negro slavery.

“ Notwithstanding the inclemency of the
weather (very severe rains having fallen until
within a quarter of an hour of the appointed
time of mecting), from ten‘to twelve thousand
people were assembled on the occasion:

“HENRY YORKE having been voted to
the Chair,

“The business was ‘opened by reading the
following Address to the king, in behalf of the
suffering patriots :

“ TO THE KING.

“ An Address from the Inhabitants of the
Town and Neighbourhood of Sheffield,
in the County of York.

“ Sirnzr;—We, the undersigned, being warm
friends of liberty and the rights of man, feel
ourselves deeply affected by the sentences
which have lately been passed in your ma-
jesty’s courts of Scotland, upon citizens Muir,
Palmer, Skirving, Margarot, and Gerrald.

‘Had these ‘men been really guilty of
crimes, their punisliment should doubtless
have been proportionate to their offences ;
but, so far from considering it as a crime for a
man to use every constitutional means in his
power to effect a reform in the Commons
House of Parliament, we think that every
man who thus exerts himself, deserves well
of his country; since we are persuaded that
nothing short of the accomplishment of such
a reform will restore peace and happiness
to our present aggrieved and injured nation.

“ We trusted also, that your majesty enter-
tained the same opinion with us of such
exalted conduct, from your majesty’s having
chosen for your most confidential servants in
the state, men who had singularly distin-
guished themselves by their patriotic exer-
tions in the cause of parliamentary reform :

“ But the friends of these sufterers having
brought their case before parliament, without
producing the desired effect—the principal of
these very servants of your majesty having
opposed the measure with all his corrupt, but
irresistible influence—seeing no other re-
source, we approach your majesty in this ad-
dress, to intreat your majesty to interfere in
behalf of these (whom we deem) innocent
men, with that power which the British con-
stitution has placed in your majesty, of par-
doning whom your majesty pleases—a privi-
lege which is sometimes graciously extended
even to real and palpable criminals.

“Let it not be recorded in the history of
this country, that king George 3rd, or any of
his judges, transported men for fourteen years,
because they had dared to speak the same
words upon a speculative subject, which, if
they were not the immediate means of ad-

wancing his majesty’s then prime minister to | obedience to it could result solely from mo-
his high situation, caused his election to be ; tives of fear. That liberty of opinien could
remarkably popular: let it not be said, that | not be denied to any free country, without
men of education, of refined sentiments, of | denying at the same time the rights of the
the most virtuous and benevolent characters, peuple. That nothing argued more strongly

and plunged into dungeuns with thieves and | sign of depriving the people of this liberty ;
prostitutes: letit not be said, that fathers wore | that it was a proof that something went
torn from their wives and children, and sons | wrong ; and that even governors were
from their aged parents, because they had the ' ashamed of their conduct, when the right of
virtue openly to condemn the acknowledged | discussion was violated, or put an end to.
corruptions of government, and to exert every The civil liberty we enjoyed in our eountry
peaceable means in their power to remove was the effect of political discussion ; amd its
them: let it not be said, that it was as great political liberty would have long since been
a crime to speak the rruta, as to be guilty restored and secured, if our rulers had not

of FELONY.

“ But rather, O king, let it be recorded, :
that George 3rd had the wisdom, the huma-'

nity, and the justice, to step in betwixt these
severe and cruel sentences and their execution.

“These are our desires—these our plain
sentiments. We know they are such as
your majesty is unaccustomed to hear; but,
if they are supported by truth and reason,
suffer not the homeliness of our manner to
offend your majesty. We are plain men, and
will not flatter a king. If our wishes be at-
tended to, we are persuaded it will, in some
good degree, hush the murmurs which unrea-
sonable severity in a government never fails
to excite; and it may also avert that storm,
which it is but too evident has long been
awfully gathering, and which may burst forth
in @ moment when your majesty thinks not.”

“ The address being read, and received with
repeated applauses, Hrnry Yorkr addressed
the meeting in support of the measure. He
observed, that the cause for which our coun-
trymen were now suffering, was the same as
had been advocated in the year 1783, by Mr.
Pitt, the duke of Richmond, and other men,
who were at this time pensioners and place-
men under the actual government; that a
convention, for the purpose of obtaining a

Pasaeinen tary reform, had been held at the |

hatched House Tavern, in which these men

went as delegates, or acted as assistants ; that ’

it was cruel, if not unjust, to punish men for
following the example which those in power

had set them. ‘The question was not a ques- |

tion of convenience, but of right.—It was not
enough to say, that the people were formerly
Fepresented, but that they had a right to he
-Tepresented now. Did the ministry, there-

fore, mean to assert, that what was right to- |

day, was wrong to-morrow? Did they mean
to declare, in the face of the world, that what
was in conformity to the maxims of justice at
that time, should, in so short a space, be
deemed unjust, and punished as a crime ?
“After having expatiated considerably on
this very important subject, he proceeded
with observing, that in all countries where
severe and sanguinary punishments were en-
couraged, men could have no affection for the
government under which they lived, and their

) ig se) to weaken or spells this right:

rst, iving a power of decisiun to j
stich the ancieat lars of the land did aed
knowledge: secondly, by confounding the
truth with the fact of publication: and,
‘thirdly, by having punished with the utmost
severity libels in private cases, to prepare the
public mind for those severe sentences in
public ones, -which dishonoured and irritated
the nation. It had been lately the fashion to
confound government with the constitution,
and the ministry with the government. To
| oppose, therefore, the mad and wild, if not
criminal schemes of administration, was to
Oppose government, and, by this mode of
reasoning, to oppose government was to be
an enemy to the constitution. A govem-
ment can never give a more authentic proof
of its propension to tyranny, and of the im-
propriety, as well as impolicy of its measures,
‘than by restraining or Prbidding the liberty
of discussing publicly matters of legisiation
‘and policy. It is debasing the character of
man, as an intellectual being, to deny him
the right of inquiring into that which even
governors allow was made for his use, namely,
government.

“Yo punish inquiry, severity is exercised
for imaginary guilt. But what is the effect?
Mischiet is prolific: violence in government
_ begets resentment in the people, who murmur
‘and exclaim: government is provoked, and
studies vengeance. When one act of ven-

geance is exposed, more always follow. Af-
_fection is lost on both sides, and, what is
worse, is irrecoverable. Hatred begins; and
the government and the people being at va-
riance, consider each other no longer as ma-
gistrate and subject, but as mutual enemies.
Hience the inhuman wish of Caligula, that he
could murder all the people at one blow.
The sequel is in order: he is continually de-
stroying them; they are continually wishing
‘him destroyed. Such conduct had the fa

, tendency of cramping the genius of men, and
| of replunging the nation into a state of bar-
| barism with regard to their religion, ther
Jaws, their morals, and their government, and
| to keep them ignorant of the most important
concerns in their trade, their splendour, their
| felicity ; whilst all the nations around them

policy, by the dering efforts and concurrence
of enlightened men, whose views were directed
to those objects alone which were really
worth their attention. The reasoning of a
vernment, which prohibits information, is
fective in every parti 3 its progress is
not to be stopped, nor even to be checked,
without mannii disadvantage. Prohibition
has no other effect than to irritate men; to
‘inspire them with an idea of insurrection, and
to giveto all their writings a libellous ten-
dency, Severe and arbitrary sentences may
intimidate, but they cannot conzince a nation.
It is by reason and argument alone, opposed
to apparent reason end apparent argument,
that a mment can hope to be victorious
over ite-internal enemies, or render itself per-
manent by the quiet and conscientious con-
currence of all its citizens. It is doing too
much honeur to innocent subjects to be
alarmed at a few pages of writing, or at a few
fugitive orations, when barracks are erected in
@ country, and 60,000 armed nvercenaries are
ready to execute the mandates of govern-
ment. Experience had proved, that the ri-
gorous prosecutions which had lately taken
place throughout England, and that the cruel
sentences which had disgraced the capital of
Scotland, had not answered the purpose of
establishing arbitrary power, and of crushing
the rebellion of honest minds. Although
there is no spirit so erect and independent as
not to be broken hy the long continuance of |
the silent and inglorious sufferings of a gaol;
yet it had been found, that men were proud
to step forward in this most stormy season,
when. such terrible examples of legal ven-
geance had been held up hefore them, to
plead the ancient rights oe their country, to
unmask the infamy, intrigue, and murderous
projects of administration, and, according to :
the principles of the purest benevolence, to |
assert the liberty of the whole human race. |
‘The present times bore a strong and marked !
resemblance to those terrific ages when priests |
held their dominion over the minds and con-
sciences of men, and when they endeavoured |
to establish the reign of intolerance and
orthodoxy amidst flakes of fire, and streams
of human blood. All history had evinced,
that every attempt to curb and bridle the ex-
pansion of the human mind had been in-
ettectual; it had evinced, that opinions,
though smothered for a time, burst forth with
redoubled fury, and were victorious over
power; it had evinced the triumph of reason
and truth over prejudice and superstition,
and that liberty, whether of opinion or per-
son, however slow in its progress, had uni-
formly moved forward towards its destined
goal; and that even, at this moment, the in-
terruptions which had been opposed to it in
our own country, although they might be im-
jurious to individuals, would finally obtain,
confirm, and establish the rights of the peo-
ple. Conscious of their uprightness, the
friends of freedom had persevered in their

4


noble cause, unappalled by the influence of
spies and informers, and by the threats of a

corrupt, a crazy, and wicked administration.

In so doing, they had acted in perfect con-

formity to the principles of virtue, without

which no man could be a friend to his coun-~
try, anda lover of mankind. Its essence con-

sisted in the regulation of oue conduct by

such moral axioms as are best calculated to

promote the general happiness of our fellow-

creatures; and as it frequently happened,

that the happiness of the tndividual stood in

direct opposition to that of the public, it is

the perfection of virtue in individuals to sa-

crifice their own happiness to that of the

public. A man, in possession of this virtuous

principle, feels delight whilst actually bum-

ing in the brazen bull of Phalaris; and such,

he trusted, was the actuating principle of
those generous patriots, who are become will-
ing victims of the most barbarous and savage
sentences that ever had been pronounced in

Britain; who had made a glorious stand

aguinst arbitrary power, and who broke loose

trom the fondest endearments of human life,
in the hope of redeeming their lost country
from the fangs of a dark and brooding preju-
dice, and fron the horrors and turpitude of
an igneminious slavery.

“Tt was the tyranny of the British govern-
ment which drove William Pena, with the
Pelscophie people called Quakers, to the de-
ectable regions of Pennsyivania, where, by
toleration, industry, and permanent credit,
they revived the simplicity of the primitive
ages of society. It was the same tyranny
which has driven into voluntaay exile, or
forced by law into banishment, the most vir-
tuous of men, the first of philosophers, the
most exalted and courageous band of patriots
that ever honoured the soil of Britain. Among
the former Joseph Priestley, one of the
most profound philosophers of the age, and
most meek au amiuble of citizens, claims
the sad pre-eminence ; and among the latter,
stand the names of those persecuted patriots,
in whose behalf we are pow about to address
the exccutive magistrate of our country—a
noble and a generous band, whose sufferings
do not claim our pity, because they boil up
our rage; whose sentences disgraced those
who pronounced them, not those on whom
they were pronounced; whose condition is
enviable, because honourable, and to the
whole of whose opinions and conduct, no
good man, or honest citizen, can give one
dissentient voice! In times like these, when
a man is mocked and insulted, because he
bears the name of a patriot, an epithet once
honoured by the people of England; at a
time when those who have the courage and
magnanimity not to flatter their country, are
deserted, betrayed, and persecuted, what ho-
nours are sufficient for oe ve thunder
truth against tyranny? What disgrace ought
not to aout ose. ted beings, those re
tize patriots, who keep aloof from the scene of

action, and riot on their country’s wrongs?
When our nation shall be regenerated, these
_persecuted nen will wear civic crowns. In
the political, as in the moral world, the friend
who appears to soothe our distresses, excites
our esteem; and he who, in calamitous times
that try men’s souls, sacrifices interest, friends,
and home, iv order to save his sinking coun-
try, merits well, not only of every Briton, but
of all maukind, and even of the government
under which he lives.

“ Fellow Citizens, the day is at length ar-
rived, when fanaticism and superstition, de-
prived of their tinsel trappings, and exposed,
in their native ugliness, to the view of man-
kind, slink scowling back to the cave of ob-
scurity; there I hope they will for ever re-
main. The energy of Englishmen will no
longer endure this strange uproar of injustice.
I trust my countrymen are sick of religious
and political imposture ; and that their deci-
sive and manly conduct will command, in an
imperious tone which will take no denial, not
a melioration of these enormous abuses, which
would be to compromise with injustice; but
I trust they will demand the annihilation of
corruptions and abuses, and a restitution of
the original rights of human nature. I ask
of our governors, this pe question, is itbetter
that the people should be in a constant state
of stupidity, than that they should be some-
times turbulent?—Ministers of state, if ye
mean to be wicked, suffer the people to write
and speak ; you will find men corrupt enough
to serve you according to your evil desires,
and who will improve you in the art of Se-
janus. If you mean to be good, permit them
to write, you will find some honest men who
will improve you in the art of a Turgot. How
many things are ye still ignorant of, before
you can become great either in good or in
evil? I see no glory, no advantage, no plea-
sure, no safety, in any man reigning as a sul-
tan over slaves. Such a horrid pre-eminence
tarnishes the lustre of the most exalted sta-
tion, It is, besides, precarious, for sultans
are frequently deposed, and vengeance wreak-
ed upon them.

“T need not invite you, fellow citizens, to
feel for any human being who suffers, much
less need I solicit your approof of the present
measure, after the general testimony of satis-
faction you have given of it. You are too en-
lightened to need the aid of any instruction
from me, and your understandings are too
much amakened to require that your passions
should be played upon. Whilst the unerring
tribunal of posterity shall condemn with scorn
and derision, with execration and disgust,
those inbuman beings who have been the
causes of such unexampled and inhuman se-
verity, our persecuted brethren will obtain a
verdict of honour and glory. I may venture
to say, that beloved by the present age, future
ae shall heap around their monuments tro-
phies of undying fame; and an exasperated
and repentant people, shall enroll their names


in the volume of history, which records also
the names of Sidney, Hampden and Locke!

“ The following Resolutions were then read
three times over, and with the exception of
one or two persons, were unanimously
adopted :

“1, That the people, being the true and
only souree of government, the Seetoca of
speaking and writing upon any subject, can
not be denied to the ineribers 8 a
vernment, without offering the grassest insult
to the majesty of the people.

“g, That therefore the condemnation of
citizens Muir, Palmer, Skirving, Margarot, and
Gerrald, to transportation, for exposing the
corruptions of the British government, was
an act better suited to the maxims of a despo-
tic than a free government.

“ 3, That the address which has now beer
read, be presented to the king, in behalf of
the above persecuted patriots.

“ On the second resolution being proposed,
an hiss'was heard from different parts of the
meeting, in consequence of one or two per-
sons holding up their hats against it; on obe
serving which, H. Yorke thus ad the
meeting:

“ Fellow Citizens;—As your chairman I
call you to order. As an individual, I must
observe, that this hissing is repugnant to the
principle of toleration or freedom, which we
wish to see established. We have this mo-
ment read, and given our assent to, an ad-
dress to the king in favour of liberty of opinion ;
let it not be said, that we are the first to violate
thatliberty in others, which we claim for our-
selves. Opinions will always vary, even
amongst the wisest and bestot men. Weare
bound, therefore, to show tenderness to the
opinions of others, and compassion even to
their prejudices. Let our enemies see that we
consecrate by our example, what we desire to
see established as a principle. Hisses do not
convince; they tend only to irritate the minds,
and to beget the ill-will of our fellow citizens:
let us, on the contrary, confront them with
the weapons of reason and truth, the onl
logic of liberal minds. Every thing whic!
has a tendency to stir up the passions without
awakening the understanding is unbecoming
of freemen, or of men who would be free.”

“ These well-timed observations had the
good effect of preventing any further signs of
Intolerance; and the utmost decorum pre-

‘vailed throughout the conduct of the busi-

ness,

“ It was next moved, ‘ that a petition be
‘ presented to the House of Commons, for a
‘ reform in the representation of the people in
‘parliament ;’ but so marked was the disaps
probation pre by the whole meeting to this
Measure, that not one single person seconded
the motion; but a most profound silence, in-
terrupted only by a few murmurs, was ob-
served: upon which, Henry Yorke again rose,
and addressed the meeting in an animated

’

speech of an hour long, and of which it is im-
possible for us to give our readers a just con-
ception. He took a general view of the Bri-
tish constitution, and stated its most promi-
nent defects; among which the want of a
perfect natienal representation was the most

laring. He dwelt a considerable time upon

is subject, and then proceeded to take a
rapid survey of the exertions which had been
made at different periods, and by different
persons, to promote the cause of parliamentary
teform.

“ He observed that the subject was become
@ mere bugbear, employed to deceive the peo-

le, and worked upon as an engine to raise
into power, needy and ambitious men: that
the very same men who in opposition had de-
clared that it was the only measure of saving
the country from ruin, were the first to repro-
bate and scout the measure of reform when they
were in power, From the corruptions of the
British government, parties had been gene-
rated, which in their route to power, had con-
vulsed and plundered the empire. Under
the distinctions of names, principles had been
forgotten; and for the sake of leaders, whom
the people had foolishly idolized, the machine
of government rolled on amidst the feuds and
contentions of party. Eternally the peace of
our country had been distarbell by the ran-
cour and animosities of factions, and the peo-
ple, instead of turning themselves to correct
the gross evils which existed in it, had ever
been the tools of base and designing men,
and seemed prepared to whet and sharpen
their swords one against another.

“It was now high time that the people
should lay asideleaders, discard, factionsand act

Sor themselves. He strongly inforced these prin-
ciples, and then pa into a complete de-
tail of the ancient constitution as established
by Alfred, which he proved to be at this time
totally defaced, if not lost. He then pursued
the gradual decline of popular liberty in Eng-
Jand, from the anarchy which was the conse-
quence of Danish and Norman invasion; and
taking a general sketch of our history, so far
as it was connected with the subject of popu-
lar representation, he made some strong and
pointed remarks on the Revolution in 1688,
the object of which, he said, was not, could not
be answered, unless annual parliaments and
ee sufirage were restored. For this he
the authority of lord Sommers, who drew
up the declaration of rights, and who was pro-
moted by William 3rd for his popular exer-
tions at that memorable epoch.

“ In order to prove that the Revolution had
not corresponded with the expectations of the
people, no sooner was the prince of Orange
established on the throne of England, than all
ideas of the ancient mode of annual parlia-
ments were effaced, and the TRIENNIAL ACT
was passed in the very face of that revolution,
and in direct contradiction to its principles;
for the revolution, at least so far as it respected
the people, was not intended to be a compro-


mise between the king and the aristocracy,
for the joint inheritance of the people, but to
establish on unequivocal principles the right
of the people to govern themselves, and to
recall those delegated powers which they had
entrusted to their servants for this purpose,
when they were either abused, or neglecte
to exercise them. If the revolution were not
a revolution for the people, it was no revolu-
tion at all, but a conspiracy of a few ennobled
oppressors against the liberties and happiness
ofthe many. Butif it were designed to com-
prehend the people, and its end has been per~
verted, or purposely laid aside, the people are
not warranted in petitioning, but are justified
in demanding as a Right, agreeably to the
tone of language used in the declaration of
rights, the restitution of annual parliaments,
and the establishment of universal suffrage.
But the shock which was given to the stabi- .
lity of these principles, was most infamously
flagrant, by the enacting of the sEPTENNIAL
act, in the reign of George 1st. If the act of
parliament in the reign of Henry 6th, erased
from the roll of citizenship some of the best
members of the community; the enacting of
the triennial and septennial acts, filled up to”
the brim the measure of governmental ini-
quity, and poured forth the waters of bitter-
ness throughout our land.

“Frtrow Citizens;—Enough of prece-
dent. The human race has long been rolling
down the tide of ages neglected, unpitied, an
oppressed. It is Tigh time that the devious
course of human policy should not be left to
the uncertain issue of storms and of elemental
wars; but that the machine of state should
be guided by the polar star of reason alone,
which is never seen but when the majesty of
the people is resplendent. What is beneficial
in the example of ages, we ought to reserve
with caution. What is injurious, and what
is only tolerably competent to answer the
common purposes of society, ought to be abo-
lished. We insult ourselves, when we ab-
jectly distrust the powers which nature has
given us; nor ought we passively to acquiesce
in institutions whic, though injurious, may
be preferable to those that may be endured
by others. We insult ourselves, when we
foolishly balance between tolerable vices and
positive good ; between unnatural systems, and
Novel, untried, but just maxims. ‘The human
mind is progressive, so is the social mind.
That the one therefore should remain sta-
tionary, amid the rapid course of the other
towards perfection, is a prejudice as unnatural
as it is injurious to the happiness of man.
The governments of Europe present no delect-
able symmetry to the contemplation of the
philosopher, no enjoyment to the satisfaction
of the citizen. A vast, deformed and cheer-
less structure, the frightful abortion of haste
and usurpation, presents to the eye of the
beholder no systematic arrangement, no har-
monious organization of society. Chance,
haste, faction, tyranny, = massacre,

and the hot, inclement action of human pas-
sions, have begotten them. Utility never has
been the end of their institution, but partial
interest has been its fruit. Such abominable
and absurd forms, such jarring and dissonant
principles, which chance has scattered over
the earth, cry aloud for something more na-
tural, more pure, and more calculated to pro-
mote the happiness of mankind. Experience
must regulate the mechanism of government,
by which I mcan not a narrow and confined,
but a liberal and enlightened experience,
which, hearing without passion or prejudice,
the testimony of ages and nations, collects
from it general principles, to further the pro-
gress of civilization. It is in history that we
are to dive for those rich materials of legis-
lative experiment, which are to ameliorate the
social order, and repair those breaches which
injustice has long since made. But if this ex-
perience be found inadequate to the purpose
of alleviating human miseries ; if it afford no-
thing but the melancholy prospect of outra-
despotism; of excessive vices on the
pert of the governing, and debasement and
vassallage on that of the ed; if it ascribe
the commeotions of sufiering countries to the
designs of factions, asd not to principles; if
it show, that in consequence of national igno-
rance, after the first ebullitions of revolt, they
have sat down in a torpid calm, and borne
with usurpations stili heavier than those by
which they were roused te arms—it must be
ted that this experience is important;
use it teaches the suffering nations of the
present day, in what manner to prepare their
combustible ingredients, and humanists in
what mamner to enkindle them, so as to pro-
duce, with effect, that grand political explo-
sion, which, at the same time that it buries
despotiam, already convulsive and agonising,
in rains, may raise up the people to the dig-
nity and sublime grandeur of freedom.

“Te effect this just and useful purpose,
reselution. of sentineng must precede revolution
of government and manners. The popular
energies must be excited, thas the popular voice
may befeltandheard. The people must grow
wise, im order that the people may rule. It
is said we preach anarchy, but what is anar-
chy but: the establishment. of confusion on
the wreck of popular opinion? It is said we
are levelless; bus those are levcllers who
would. wish to seduce man to the condition of
the brute, guided by passion, and wninfuenced.
by reason. Those are levellers whose hands
are dipped in the public spoils; who assert
inxpusity fer crimes, and inviolahility of per-
sona ; who would make humanity take a re-
trograde motion; who would paisy the arm
of justice, and defeat the endof equal laws.
bape have ever disclaimed the foolish idea of
levelling property ; because our own pyu i
the fruit of our laboar, or of our fet en wae
by the examale, be exposed to the invasion of
the first mtrudes. It were well, if those who
confound justice with crimes, would consider


that the poor man's property, little as it is, is
as precious to him, as is the wealthy stock of
the rich man. It were well, if fecling the
force of this principle, the aristocracy would
unite with us in the cguse in which we are
embarked. Property, they say, iseaered.- Is
not then the property of the poor man as sacred
as that of the rich; and ought it to be filched
or forced from him without his consent, any
‘ move than that ef the rich man? Can these
; who do not respect the property of otbers,
expect others to respect their property? We
wish to exail, not te level. We wish to better
the condition of the wretched; to equalize men
under the influence of law; but te give to
merit, industry, talents, patrimony, virtee,
their proper weight and correspendent dig-
nity in the social order. Are we then ungo-
ivernable, because we rcjeet mis-government?
Are we ungrateful, because we defend cur
liberty and property against those who ought
to respect them? Are we rebels in manm-
taining our violated laws against those whe
ase open rebels to laws, and who set them-
selves above those laws which they ought to
have venerated? I know, that in all ages of
the world, people who would not be oppressed
have been reckoned ungovernable by mea
who are, or who would be oppressurs. I
know that the enemies of oppression have
always becn stigmatized as enemies of go-
verament. I knew that it is seditious to
blame the excesses of power, and insolent to
mentioa the insolence of those who abuse
power. I know that it is sedition to distin-
guish between public right and public wrong,
between government and tyranny. Nor is it
enough to acknowledge all good government
to be irresistible ; but the worst, and the abuse
of the dest, must be irresistible also. I know
that to complaia of tyranny is faction, and to
; throw it off rebedlion; but they who oppress
are the greatest Rebeds, and for the oppressed
to tusn upon them, is but to resist Rebellion—
it is but to do a just and nateral action.
Whoever violates the laws of reason, equity,
and nature, whatever station or name he may
bear, is a Rebel, subject to laws against ty-
rants and rebellion. ‘Tyrants, theretore, and
oppressors, are the highest and most con-
summate rebels in the world—capital traitors
to God and Man, and punishable by all the
laws of God and Man. Amid all the absor-
dities and chimeras of paganism, it was never
believed that tyranny was warranted by
heaven. It was never believed that the
bloody Caligula was the vicegerent of God,
and that the worst of men had a commission
from heaven to oppress the human race. It
was never believed that murder, rapine, and
misrule, were government; and that lawless
and bloody crowned robbers, were gover-
nors divinely appointed. It was never be-
lieved that society had no remedy against
devouring lust the raging sword, which
were destroying all the ends of society,
and even society itself Such indignitics



God and man were never broached by pagans; | attempt be made to wrest what remains of

they never propagated doctrines which would
have turned men into idcots, destitute of re-
flection and fecling; into beasts of burthen
and beasts of sacrifice; turned heaven into
hell; human society into a chaos of blood and
carcases; and the earth into a place of tor-
ments. It never entered into the heart of a
Greek or a Roman, nor into any heart that
felt the sentiments of virtue and humanity,
that it was unlawful to defend nature; a crime
to ward off murder, barbarity, and desolation;
and an impiety to do the most godlike action
which can be done on this side heaven, that
of disarming tyrants, and of saving our country
from perishing. Government is doubtless a
sacred thing, and justly claims our reverence
and duty; Sut when government is general
oppression; when havoc, spoil, and persecution
prevail, to the destruction of all who do well;
when law and justice are banished, and mili-

tary despotism triumphs; when property is |

attacked and seized without the consent of
its owner, and lives are wantonly destroyed !
—is this government too? If it be, tell me
what is not government? I do not think, in
an age like this, that the people of this, or
any country, can ever be so sunk or deadened
by oppression, but that repeated provocation
will raise a spirit amongst them capable of
accomplishing the greatest projects. Even
the most professed and degraded slaves, the
people of Turkey, often rouse themselves,
and casting thcir proud rider to the earth,
trample him to death. A little spark often
kindles a great flame, and a flame soon
spreads to a conilagration. An ignorant

mation roused to assert its liberties, will |

be mad and furious; for when men are
used like beasts, they will act like beasts!
But when an enlightened people, know-
Ing their rights, are reduced to a state
of degradation, they will know that_ their
condition cannot be worse, but, by their own
efforts, their condition must be Better. An
ignorant people, incited by repeated injury to
shake off the load of injustice, will risk un-
seen evils and calamities—will risk even a
civil war to be revenged on their oppressors.
Such was the temper of the Romans upon the
revolt of Sacrovir—they even exulted in it,
and in hatred to Tiberius, wished success to
the public enemy. — Such were the injured
people of Spain, who, when the Romans
came, joyfully received them as their deli-
verers from the tyrannous yoke of Carthage.
But an enlightened people will never sully
the victories of patriotism by such irregular
conduct Revenge will never be adopted as
a@ principle
nour, and they will glory in awaiting the slow
process of universal information, as a prelude
to universal emancipation, rather than tarnish
the career of liberty, by involving their country
in scenes of terror, waste and depredation.
Oppressed nature will, at a proper season,
depart from passive principle ; and should an

liberty from us, I trust all men will concur to
vindicate their violated rights—tor, if the
lived be suffered once, it will be often re-
peated. A few repetitions create a habit,
and habit will claim prescription and right.
For governors to be omnipotent, the race of
man must be extinct; and no argument for
destroying anarchy can be used, but what is
‘full as strong for the overthrow of tyranny.
It is difficult to restore public affairs, when
once disconcerted, to their former steady
principle—numbers will engage in the cors
tuption, and will try every art and power to
support it, and they will continue to do so,
until nature, which is always uppermost in
: Man, signs their tragical doom !

“ Citizens ;—I repeat my former assertion.
Go on as you hitherto have done, in the cul-

Peace will actuate their demea-.

ture of reason, Disseminate throughout the
; whole of your country, that knowledge which
is so necessary to man’s happiness, and which
. you have yourselves acquired. Teach your
j children and your countrymen the sacred
lessons of virtue, which are the foundations
of all human polity. Teach them to respect
themselves, and to love their country. Teach
them to do unto all men as they would that
they should do unto them, and thcir love shall
; not be confined to their country, but shall ex
tend to the whole human race. When such
| a revolution of sentiment shall have dispersed
the mists of prejudice ; when by the incessant
thunderings from the press, the meanest cot-
| tager of our country shall be enlightened, and
the sun of reason shall shine in its fullest me-
ridian over us; then the commanding voice
of the whole people shall recommend the five
hundred and fifty-eight gentlemen in St.
Stephen’s Chapel, to go about their business.”

“ The following Resolutions were next read,
and unanimously approved of, amidst the
loudest applauses.

“4, Thatin every country where the people
have no share in their government, taxation
is ae .

“ 5, That therefore a government is tyran-
nical or free, in proportion as the people are
equally, or unequally, represented.

“6. Convinced of this truth, it is the opi-
nion of this meeting, that the people ought
to demand as a right, and not petition as a
| favour, for universal representation,

“7, That therefore we will petition the
TJouse of Commons no more on this subject.”

[Read from “ An Address to the British Na-
tion,” from the first page (page 27 of the
pamphlet) and from page 34 to 36.)

“ An Address to the British Nation.
“Friends and Countrymen;—We have
heard this day decided, with the exception of
only one dissentient voice, that the House of

Commons shall never again be petitioned by

us, on the subject of parliamentary reform.

“ We owe to the nation, to posterity, even
to foreign countries, and to the government
2s


Itself under which we live, an exposition of
our motives. To the nation we owe this duty,
because we are of opinion, that THE WILL OF
THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE, SHOULD BE, AT
ALL TIMES, THE SUPREME LAW; and that if
the few dissent from the opinion of the many,
however obligatory the will of the majority
may be to them as arule of action, yet opi-
nion is always free and sacred, the right of
man to enjoy, and the conscientious duty of
man to diffuse. Under the full conviction of
this principle, we feel ourselves, at present,
the mimority, because we are the first to agi-
tate the question, and to repel the monstrous
idea of Pentontng when our petitions are not
received by the House of Commons. But, we
are numerous—we are many thousands; and
as nothing opens the eyes of men so much as
their interests, we demand, fellow-citizens,
way, we are entitled to it from our numbers,
that you lend an attentive ear to the truths
we are about to utter, and tothe reclamations
we are about to make in favour of oppressed
humanity.”

_ “ Our petition was received with the utmost
indignation by the House of Commons ;
which was no more than we expected. We
knew that the homely truths we uttered, would
be very unwelcome guests in that house. We
never expected that a body in which there
were so many placemen and pensioners, would
listen to the palpable facts stated in that peti-
tion; the object of which was to root out in-
justice, and to curb licentiousness and cor-
ruption. Nevertheless, as we were called
upon by our countrymen to unite with them,
we ;thonght ourselves bound to comply with
their wishes, And, although our petition was
disdainfully rejected, because not couched in
language sufficiently polite and respectful for
the five hundred and fifty-eight gentlemen who
sit at the House of Commons, yet, believe us,
FELLOW-CITIZENS, we are still of opinion, that
the matter it contained, was not only just and
Proper, but we think, that even the language,
which gave so much offence to the honourable
&entlemen, was much too polite and too mode-
rate for us. For, if the House of Commons
were the real representatives of the people, we
certainly had a right to dictate, and not to
petition, because they could be considered in
no other light than as the organs of the public
will. And, if they refused to obey that will,
they would be usurpers, and not representa-
tives. If, on the contrary, they are not the
representatives of the people, what have we
to do with them? If they are not our repre-
sentatives, we cannot be their constituents ;
and to petition those who are not our repre-
sentatives as our representatives, would be a
manifest absurdity, if not’ an insult and
mockery of ourselves, However, the petition,
such as it was, being termed disrespectful,
was thrown out bya majority of 79, there
being 29 only who voted for its being received,
and 108 who voted against it, Such impe-


rious treatment rather gives warning than
strikes terror. The abuse of representation
can never come in the place of a rule, for no
legal power can be derived from injury or in-
justice. On this ground alone, therefore, we
are justified in preserving a sullen silence m
respect to the House of Commons. For, if
grievances, abuses, complaints, and truth, are
to be discarded from that House, because not
dressed in a gentleman-like language, how are
we, plain mechanics, ever to obtain redress,
who are not gentlemen, and who are, conse-
quently, ignorant of those polite and courtly
expressions which are necessary to gain a
hearing in that House. We are ignorant of
the art of displaying truth by halves, and, as
we love plain dealing ourselves, we detest
hypocrisy in others, and pity those who would
wish us to follow their cxample. We said to
the House of Commons, we are wronged and
aggrieved—will you right us, and redress our
grievances, or will you not? If you will, we
shall be satisfied; if you will not, we shall
seek redress some other way. This is the
sole question with us, and we put it, as we
thought, in a most becoming style to the
House of Commons. But, our petition bei
scouted, we shall trouble them no more wit!
our coarse and unmannerly language. It will
be our duty to proceed, as we have uniformly
done hitherto, in enlightening the public
mind; and, when a complete revolution of
sentiment shall take place (as will shortly be
the case) in our country, we shall open our
mouths, in that key we think most agreeable
to ourselves; and our voice, together with
that of our disfranchised countrymen, will
resemble, perhaps, the thunderings from
Mount Sinai!”

“ Yes, countrymen, we demand equality
of rights, in which is included equality of re-
presentation, without which terror is law, and
the obligations of justice are weakened ; be-
cause, unsanctioned by the sacred voice of

}the people. We are not speaking of that

visionary equality of property, the practical
assertion oF biel weld vetolate the world,
and replunge it into the darkest and wildest
barbarism ; but that equality we claim, is to
make the slave a man, the man a citizen, and
the citizen an imtegral part of the state; to
make him a joint sovereign, and not a sub-
ject; to oblige law, which ought to be an
emanation from the general will, to shed its
influence, without distinction, over the heads
of all, and to restrain or strike the wealthy
poses equally with the more homely ot-
ender. We on | to give rights to him who
has none, and a country to San who wants
one. We wish to upset the idol of injustice,
which has poured forth, from its exalted
throne, a deluge of sorrow, and flooded the
world with the tears and the blood of its in-
habitants. We desire to see wisdom demand-
ing of miserable millions their wants,

humanity at hand to supply them. We de

sire to see the sanctuary of virtue erected, and
the standard of liberty planted in our land,
around which the people may rally as to an
holy of holies. In short, we desire to see the
altar of equality blazing in Britain, whose
streams of fire, whilst they shall shock, con-
vulse, and tear down the rotten pillars of pre-
judices; whilst they shall consume tyrants,
and terrify public delinquents, shall pierce
into the hearts of the whole people, and con-
firm the wide empire of morals on the wreck
of superstition and vice. Such is our equality,
and such is the equality which we proudly
gratulate our countrymen, will shortly be
established in Britain, and which we invite
pou PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND, to partake of.—The

ks of the Forth, the fields of Bannockburn
and Culloden, and that tribunal of Edinburgh,
which has disgraced your capital, shall yet bear
testimony to the cause for which FLetcuer
wrote, and Wattace bled.”

William Broomhead cross-examined by Mr.

ibbs,

You said, about the time these pikes were
talked about, there had been a mischievous
band-bill circulated, for the purpose, as you
Suppose, of exciting the people against the
Society ; can you tell me what was the general
substance of it?—I had one in my hand, but
cannot speak to every thing it contained.

But what was the general substance of it?
~—It was a call to the people to arm against
foreign and internal enemies, and the reply
which was made to it was couched in the same

e.

That was the first thing that was published ;
at what time was it published? before or after
this meeting that you speak of?—I do not
recollect the exact time, but I read them
both, and should have been happy if I had
had them both here.

But you say the object of it was to provoke
the people ?—It was given out, by various
people in the town of Sheffield, we can never
do any thing against these people, against
the society, till we ourselves cause a riot.

people meant the society ?—Yes; and
I saw myself several persons ride up -and
down, round the market-place, full gallop, to
ride over people, when, at the same time, it
was only boys.

‘The cry was, they could never do any thing
with yous unless they caused a riot against

ou, they could make nothing of ite—it has
been said so, but I cannot recollect who said
At; but this wicked hand-bill appearing, with-
out the sanction of the law, or the magistrate,
—Ireadit; and, if I had been aware of this, I
would have brought it;—this was the cause
of any thing being spoken concerning arms,


Among all the conversation you have ever
heard upon the subject of these pikes, were
they intended for the purpose of making an
attack upon any power in this country, or onl.
for defending yourselves, if you should be at-
tacked?—I never understood them in any
other light, and what was said about them
was in answer to this wicked hand-bill. There
was neither Mr. Wilkinson’s name, nor Mr.
Althorp’s, nor any gentleman’s name in the
town to it.

Whether you ever collected, from those
who talked of pikes, or ever produced any,
that they meant to make any attack upon
any of the powers in this country, or only to
defend theinselves, if they were illegally at-
tacked ?—This was the very truth ; to oppose
illegal force, and direct violation of the law of
the land, made upon us, as was done at Man-
chester and at Birmingham.

Then they were meant only to be used ow
the defensive ?—Mr. Gale had this hand-bill
in his hand, when he first mentioned the
pikes at this meeting, or in his pocket; and
there were several resolves printed in his
paper the week following, and direct answers
thereto, mentioning something upon tHe
matter. I would have brought them both
with me, if I had been apprehensive of this.

Had any of the people in this society to
which you belonged, any idea of making any
attack upon either the King, or the House of
Lords? had they any idea of altering the go-
vernment in that respect ?—I think they ought
to be sent to Bedlam, if they had.

Had you, as one of that socicty, any such
intention yourself?—Just the same as flying
to the sun.

But to speak plain; by that you mean, I
suppose, that you never had any such thought
in your mind?—No; never. '

What was it that you wished to produce by
these meetings of yours ?—To enlighten the
people ; to show the people the reason, the
ground of all their complaints and sufferings ;
when a man works hard for thirteen or four-
teen hours of the day, the week through, and
is not able to maintain his family; that is
what I understood of it; to show the people
the ground of this; why they were not able.

Was not the object of your meeting a par-
liamentary reform ?—Yes, it was ; and as such
we corresponded with the society of the
Friends of the People, as well as the Consti-
tutional Society.

Who were the members of the Friends of
the People ?—There were several communica-
tions, I know, received from that society.

Mr. Stuart, I believe was the secretary ?~-

es.

Should you have continued a member of
this society, ifyou had thoughtthat they had
any intent of shaking either the king, or the
lords, or of displacing the king from his
throne?—No. :

You would not ?—No.

_ Should you not have abhorred such en
idea ?~Yes, yes,

Have you any reason, from any thing that
ever passed in the society, to believe there
was a single member of it who entertained
such a notion?—-No; andI do not believe
there is such a wicked man amongst them.

The object of your meeting, you say, was to
state to the people the grounds of certain evils
which you thought to exist; and wished to
bring about a parliamentary refurm—-Ws
that a parliamentary reform in the House of
Commons?—-In the House of Commons.

You meant that the king and the lords
should remain as they were ; but that there
should be a reform in the House of Commons?
woe Yes.

Did you believe, and was that the ground
upon which you acted, that by producing such
reform as you wished in the House of Com-
mons, that those evils would be remedied ?~-
That the King, the Lords, and Commons,
might themselves, with the concurrence of
the nation, remedy these evils. As to refor-
ming, as to the expenditure, and other mat-
re we had not the vanity to think of sucha
thing.

‘Then do I understand you right, when I
suppose this to have been your principle—
that you thought the King, and the Lords, with
the House of Commons, so reformed, would
redress all your grievances ?—Yes.

Was it your object to attain this end peace-
ably ?---Thereis no one doubts itin Sheffield,
that will speak honestly.

T speak of your own particular object—
Your object was to attain it peaceably ?—It
avas.

Have you any reason to think it was the
object of any other man in the society, to use
any but peaceable means to obtain it ?—Not
to my knowledge-—-what persons might do,
had any thing happened, as a convention
being called, we cannot tell for their wicked-
ness.

Mr. Gibbs—Repeat that answer.—Had
there been a convention, those societies that
sent them, I suppose, would have put confi-
dence in them, and in their consultations,

supposing them to be competent to devise |

and dircct the means to the end for a parlia-
mentary reform—I understand it in that light.

When that mecting was had, to be sure no
moan can answer for the acts of those who
should compose it--certainly not ; but had
you any reason to suppose, that those whom
you should send to that meeting would act
otherwise than peaceably ? would youhavesent
any who you did not think would have acted
peaceably ?---No; those would have acted
peaceably that we should have sent; we
should have sent none else but such.

And you have no reason to think that others
would have acted otherwise than peaceably ?
No; [ have no reason to think so what-
ever,

When national representation was talked
of by Mr. Yorke at this meeting, by national
representation, was jt not meant the represen-


[632°

tation of the people of England in the House
of Commons ?—I always understood it 50 for
my part.

William Broonhead, re-examined by Mr.
Garrow,

T could wish to ascertain whether I have
taken you correctly; you meant, and as far
as you understand, your society meant to pro-
duce a reform of the representation of the
people in the Commons House of parliament

y peaceable means ?---Yes.

but you apprehended, that when you should
depute your delegates to a convention, that
you trusted to that convention, and that what
might then be done you could not answer for,
not being able to answer for the wickedness
of individuals—Did I take you correctly ?—
Yes.

For the purpose of obtaining this desirable
object of a parliamentary reform, you say you
corresponded not only with the Constitutional
Society, but with other societies ; and among
them, you have named a society called, a so-
ciety of the. Friends of the People ?---Yes.

Do you know the answer which that society
returned to your’s as early as the 26th of
May ?—-I do not now recollect the answer.

Perhaps I may assist your memory, by re-
minding you of the reply of your secretary to
that society ?—Perhaps it might not be me.

Da you know a person of the name of Ash-
ton?—-Yes. ©

Did he ever act as secretary to your so-
ciety ?---Yes.

You have said that your object, and, as far
as you know, theobject of your society, was,to
obtain a reform by peaceable means, and by
enlightening the public—I ask you, if you do
not know, that upon the society of the Friends
of the People returning some answer to your
society, that your society wrote, by means of
Ashton, your secretary, disclaiming any far-
ther communication with the society of the
Friends of the People, as unfit for your pur-
pose ?---That he mightdo—thisI cannot say;
but I do not know of a certainty that he did;
because great part of the time when he was
secretary, I had no concern with the society.

Was the measure ofdiscarding this society
of the Friends of the People, as unfit for your
purposes, discussed in your committees ?—I
do not recollect its being discussed in a com-
mittee.

Was it discussed in any mecting of the di-
visions ?—Not in those meetings of the divi-
sions I have been speakingof,

Wasit in any meetings ?---Yes, it may have
been—I do not recollect that it was.

That answer won’t suit me—I ask, whether
in any meetings of your society, the propriety
of having nothing farther to do with this so-
ciety, the Friends of the People, because they
would not go the lengths that made them fit
for your communication, was ever discussed?
—TJhat was discussed. .

Was the result of that discussion commun

cated to your associated society, the Constitu-
tional Society, that this society, the Friends
ofthe People, whatever they professed to do,
were not'fit persons for your having any thing
more to do with them ?—I[ do not know that
such a letter was communicated, nor such a
letter received.

Idonot ask you, whether you know that
such a letter was received, or whether you
know that such a letter was sent; but I ask
you, if the result of your deliberation was
not, that they were unfit for your society,
thatthe Constitutional Society might be so
informed ?—Nay, I am not certain that it was
the result of the determination of that meet-
ing; I rather think that it was determined af-
terwards, if it was determined at all.

Do yourecollect whether Mr. Yorke took
any part in that discussion ?—No, he was not
there then.

Who were the parties ?—Several persons
spoke, among whom I was one.

Have you read the declarations published
by that society, called the Friends of the
People : doubtless you have, for your informa-
tion; or if you have not read them yourself,
have they been read in your society ?—-I
might have read them-—I will not say-—I be-
lieve I might. :

Do you not know that in language, to
which to be sure I can do no justice, they
declared their firm intention, by all constitu-
tional and proper means, to produce that very
thing which you state to have been your ob-
ject, a reform in the representation of the
Commons House of parliament ?---Great num-
bers of people did not believe them-—they did
not believe them to be honest.

However, they had made those professions ?
—Yes; there was something of that.

But that you did not quite believe. Was
this, think you, as early asthe 26th of May,
1792, that you disclaimed these Friends of the
People ?---It may, I do not recollect the time
exactly ; I think it might be about that time.

And that was long before Mr. Yorke came
among you upon his last mission ?-—It was.
_And of course long before all these discus-
sions. Be so good as to tell mea little more
distinctly what this mischievous hand-bill was
that excited you to arms—I believe it was
calling upon people to associate, and to arm
against foreign invaders and domestic ene-
mies ?—-Yes; but not with any magistrate’s
hame to it. .

But the object was calling upon the people
of Sheffield to arm against foreign invaders
and domestic enemies?-— Yes; and that
meeting, when arms were spoken of, it was
determined, in several resolutions, to get those
ams for the same purpose, in reply to that.

Tet us see that we quite understand one
another, Did you adopt that hand-bill, and
arm in consequence of it, or were you alarmed
atits being prodigiously unconstitutional, and
arm against it ?—I never did.

But the society ?—Some few might,


Was thatto arm against the invasion of
foreign enemies, or protect yourselves against
attack from domestic enemies?--It was
couched in words, which were taken and put
into resolves, and advertised in Gale’s paper
the next week.

Your society, after this hand-bill, calling
upon people to arm against foreign invaders
and domestic enemies, took that hand-bill as
their text, commenting upon it, adopting
their resolution, and arming themselves?-—
Yes, against foreign invaders and domestic
enemies. ;

Your reason for doing this was, that you
were afraid of illegal force being used against
you, as had been done at Manchester and at
Birmingham. Did you apply to any magis-

trate for protection ?---It was needless till the

injury was done.

Give me the facts first, and the comment
afterwards. Did you apply to any magistrate
informing him, that you, who were peaceable
persons, had been threatened with attacks,
and wanted the protection of the civil power?
-—-No; why should we till we were attacked?

Tam not capable of arguing with you; I
say that unaffectedly. Did you apply to any
magistrate, informing him, that any peaceable
persons had been threatened with attacks,
and wanted the protection of the civil power?
--No, not to my knowledge.

But, on the contrary, you published resolu-
tions for arming ?—To that purpose, couched
in their words.

You had no intention at all of altering the

overnment, but of applying to the House of
Ee crus to redress the grievances, under
which the people suffered ?—I always under-
stood it in that light.

How early was it that you came to resolu-
tions in your society to petition the House of
Commons no more; for that these 558
persons were too fine gentlemen for you; and
you were not used to the cuurtly language that
would suit their ears ?-~--These were drawn up
by Gale and Yorke, and therefore they were
winked at out of complaisance to them.

And you, who were too rough for the
House of Commons, were courtly enough to
i? these resolutions which were proposed

y Yorke and Gale, two of the active meim-
bers of the society---You say the society
winked at them ?-—-I suppose they did, know-
ing them to be of superior knowledge.

However, pass them you did?~-Yes, be.
lieving them to be of superior knowledge to
ourselves. .

The next step was to form a convention,
and by the delegates to procure a full, fair, and
equal representation by means of the conven-
tion ?---There was then at that very time 3
petition to the king.

About the slave-trade ?--Yes, and about a
reform too.

Whether this was a part of these resolu-
tions which passed upon the subject of arming

ment, has a suspicious and alarming appear- | “ A Serious Lecture, delivered at Snxrriety,

ance, is contrary to the spirit of our constitu-
tion, and deserving of the marked indignation
of every Englishman”~-Was that one of the
resolutions that you passed at the time of
adopting the resolution about thehand-bill ?—-
That was passed when the lecture was read.

Was that long after the hand-bill?—No ;
long before.

“That it is high time to be upon our guard,
since these armed monsters may in a moment
be let loose upon us, and pesboularty as the
erection of barracks throughout the kingdom
may only have been an introductory measure
to the filling them with foreign mercenaries”
—Was that one of the resolutions you passed
long before the hand-bill Sometime before ;
I do not know exactly how long. .

Be so good as to tell me, as you were toarm
at Sheffield, very properly as I agree with you,
for the sake of preventing attacks upon you,
whether you communicated to any other
parts of the kingdom the sort of instruments
with which you meant to arm yourselves,
and your plan of arming?—-I never did; and
I do not know whether any body else did
or no.

Do you mean to say, that you do not now
know that your society communicated plans for
arming, the mode of procuring the instru-
ments, and the models of the weapons ?—I
never knew a syllable of that till I was in-
formed of it before the privy council.

Then if Davison, in the name of the society,
sent any such letter to London, you were not
in that secret ?—I was not.

You know Davison very well?~-Yes, I
knew him some little time.

He was a member of the society ?—~Yes, I
suppose he was.

You have told me, there was no man at
Shefficld mad enough to think of altering the
percronient by force at all—-Do you include

avison in the number ?—Well, but at the
same time, there may be wicked men among
all bodies.

Doubtless there may—-Do you include
Davison in the number of those who you say
are uot to be found in Sheffield, with any bad
intention against his majesty, or the govern-
ment of the country ?—I will say this, he did
it without the knowledge of the society, and
that he did it without my knowledge.

That is not an answer to my question.—I
have not a doubt of that being proved; but
how can I speak to it when I did not know it?

Mr. Attorney General.—While we wait for
the next witness, we will read that part of the

aper called the “ Fast Day, as observed at
heffield,” which relates to the landing the
Hessian troops—This was in the year 1794.

The following Extracts were read from a
: printed Pamphlet, intituled,

“ FAST DAY.

% A Royal Proclamation having been issued,
commanding February the 28th, 1794, tole
observed asa General Fast, the Friends of
Peace and Rerors, in Sheffield, determined
to honour the Day in the most distinguished
Manner. Accordingly the THOUSANDS
of thut Town assembled upon a spacious plain
near West-street, Backfields, where the Meed-
ing was opened with ine 3 after whiche
Serrous Lecrune, suitable to the Occasion,
was read with great Energy to the immenx
Concourse go, People, who listened in the most
attentive Silence. A Hy«n, prepared for
this Solemnity, was then sung in full Chores
by the whole Assembly. Immediately after,
Recaes Camace being called to the Chair,
the following Resolutions were unanimously
passed, and the Meeting dissolved in that
orderly and peaceable Manner, which so en-
nently distinguishes the patriotic Inhabitants
of Sheffield,

“ A Serious Lecture.

“In every age of the world, the cause of
truth has always met with its OppOees, when-
ever it chanced to clash with the interests of
a venal tribe of Kings, Courtiers, Priests, and
their accomplices. By reading over the 16th
chapter of 1 Kings, we find that this was the
case; yet the Almighty was pleased by an act
of Omnipotent Power, to overturn the malice
and wicked intentions of that infamous tyrant
Ahab, and the Satellites who surrounded him:
for, in the presence of them all (though it
made against them) Truth shone forth with
redoubled splendour, and the very judgment
which Elijah would probably have met with,
had not God been for him, fell on those 2b-
-‘minable Deceivers of Mankind. I refer you
to the chapter itself, and without further i-
troduction, I shall makea few remarks on the
events of that period, as it must be obvious,
to every ingenuous mind, that there is a great
similarity betwixt the conduct of the rulers of
that day, and those of the present: therefore
it may be needful to observe, ;

“ First, Baal’s pee could not possibly
succeed, because he to whom they prayed
could not help them. Baal, being a name
given to an Heathen God, who had no gxise
ence except in the imagination of his devotees.
And @dly, They had a bad cause in band,
therefore, were not likely to prevail; no mo-
tives to induce them but pride; no appetites
to serve, but what were sensual and devilish,
so that if they had offered sacrifice to the true

tad cause, they would not have ob-
 ro


| tained their end—for ‘ the ears of the Lord are
*not open to the cries of the foolish, but unto

I. “the wise.’ . .

4 “It isin this point of light, I view, with
concern, a combination of Kings apparently
leagued against the cause of Freedom; a com-
bination which I believe to be odious in the
sight of Heaven, although for its support we

| are commanded a second time from the

Throne, not of God, to fast and pray for the

success of our arms over our brethren, who

are struggling for every thing that is dear to

Man, and which is the will of God he should

be possessed of ~Liserry, civil, political, and

religious, Life without them is a burden.”

[Page 11, Resolutions, &c.]
“ RESOLUTIONS.

« RESOLVED UNANIMOUSLY,

“4. That War, the wretched artifice of
Courts, is a System of Rapine and Blood,
unworthy of rational beings, and utterly re-
pughant to the mild and benevolent principles
of the Christian Religion.

“@. That if the present war, be a war of
Combined Kings against the people of France,
to overthrow that Liberty which they are
struggling to establish, it is, in our opinion, a
war of the most diabolical kind.

“3, That when public Fasts and Humilia-
tions are ordered with the same breath, which
commands the shedding of oceans of Human
Blood—however they may answer the pur-
poses of State Policy—they are solemn pros-
titutions of Religion.

“<4, That the landing of Hessian troops in
this country (a ferocious and unprincipled
horde of Butchers) without consent of Parlia-
ment, has a suspicious and alarming appear-
ance, is contrary to the spirit of our Constitu-
tion, and deserving of the marked indignation
of every Englishman.

“5. That it is high time to be upon our
Guard, since these armed monsters may in a
moment be let loose upon us ; particularly, as
the erection of barracks throughout the king-
dom may only have been an introductory
measure to the filling them with Foreign
Mercenaries.

«<6. That the high and free-born minds of
Britons, revolt at the idea of such a Slavish
System, and cannot be so far broken, as to
kiss the hand which would chain them to its
will.

“7. That Peace and Liberty are the off-
spring of Heaven, and that Life without them
is a burden,

“<8. That the Thanks of this Meeting are
due to Earl Stanhope, for his Motion and
spirited Specch for acknowledging the French
Republic, and restoring Peace to our dis-
tressed country; for his Motions and able
Speech in behalf of the persecuted and suffer-
agg patriots, Messrs. Muir, Palmer, Skirving,
and Margarot, in which he nobly stood alone ;


and also for the whole of his truly animated
and benevolent exertions in support of the in-
jured Rights of the People.

“9. The Thanks of this Meeting are also
due to Mr. Sheridan, for his nervous and elo~
quent Speeches in the cause of injured Patrio-
tism, and in support of the Constitution; and
also to every other Member of Parliament
who has nobly stood forward at this important
crisis, in support of the Constitutional Liber-
ties of Englishmen.

“10. That if any thing had been necessary
to have convinced us of the total inefficacy of
argument against a Ministerial Majority, the
decisions which have lately taken place in Pare
liament, would have fully confirmed our opi-
nion.

“41, That therefore the People have no
remedy for their grievances, but a REFORM
IN PARLIAMENT—a measure which we
determine never to relinquish, though we
follow our Brethren -in the same Glorious
Cause to Botany Bay.

MENT.

“ Committee Room, March 20, 1794.

“ RESOLVED, That the Society approve
the sentiments contained in the Serious Lec-
ture delivered to the CONSTITUTIONAL
SOCIETY at SHEFFIELD, on the 28th of
last month—and earnestly recommend it to
the perusal of all who think CIVIL and RE-
LIGIOUS LIBERTY a Blessing.

« Resolved, That the Commanding a Gene-
ral Fast, for the purpose of imploring the Di-
vine Father of Mercy and Peace to support
and prosper us in the Aorrid act of deliberately
destroying our fellow-creatures, is repugnant
to the true spirit and principles of Christi-
anity, where we are commanded to pray for
our enemies, &c. And further considering,
that a ee. part of the PEOPLE are unac-
quainted with the nature of the present WAR,
either as to its justice or necessity (every en-
deavour being used to keep them ignorant of
the real principles and design for which it was
commenced) to approach and to supplicate the
Omniscient Power, under such circumstan-
ces, and for such a purpose, must indeed be
dreadful, since knowledge and conviction are
wanting.—The worse than hypocritical hearts
of those who are the Authors of such a mea-
sure—~although they at present impose upom
the ignorant and credulous, by such detest-
able, such pretended show of devotion-——cannot
escape the chastisement of that Power, whom
they thus insult, and from whose judgment
there is no appeal.

What did he say about arms?—He said

room, who he was I did not know, nor him

from Sheffield; he said it would be

a Se n bread and cheese for one day ;
Mr. Yorke was not there then.

Was it the same night ?-~No, it might be
two or three nights before.

when he got up and left the room.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—-Did you see
Mr. Yorke any more ?~-I saw him no more
after that.

Mr. Wood.—Do you knew where he went?
~-I did not.

Did you continue in the society after that
night, or leave it ?—I went after that to Mr.
Dundas’s office, and likewise to my lord
mayor, who is sitting there :—No, it was sir
James Sanderson.

Have you seen any other bills like that
{showing one to the witness] ?---No.

Did you see that before ?—No.

Why did you go to my lord mayor ?—Be-
cause I ay a it was proper that govern-
ment should be let into the light of what the:
were proceeding upon; immediately as
found out what they were I gave informa-
tion

What had you apprehended them to be at
the first At the first I was asked to go to
the society---I did not know what they were ;
as soon asI got in, Smith was delegate ; the
person with me was a friend of Smith's;
they asked me to be made a member—-I

3; I did not know what it was, I gave
irteen-pence, and they gave mea ticket.

Where is it?—-I gave it to Mr. Dundas’s
secretary.

How long was it before that?—I think I
was seven times there.

Henry Alexander —Cross-examined by Mr.
Erskine.

What are you ?—A linen-draper.

Where do you live ?—At the Rose, in the
Fleet-market ; I reside there at present.

At what time of the year was it that you
first went with your friend to this society ?—
Towards the latter end of the year 1793.

Did you go for the purpose of being a
member ?—I did not, though I became one.

For what purpose did you go?—I went for
the Purpose of going to a club ; my acquaint-
ance asked me if I would go to a society with
him, and I went.

Who is this friend?—His name is White-
horn.

You went there perhaps from curiosity ?--
Nothing else.

Was Mr. Yorke there that night ?---He was

not.

Who might be there that first night ?—
Some that were there as delegates; Ashley
was there, and Baxter was there; these are
all I know by name, except Whitchom.


What day of the month was it ?---I cannot

say.
; What day of the week was it ?~-Of a Tues-

ay.
In what month ?—I cannot say the month:

Try ?—I cannot.

Did you hear any thing that offended you
that night?—No, nothing at all.

How long did they sit ?—Till twelve---’till
near one o'clock,

What did they converse about ?—They had
papers.

Were they read?—I think Mr. Smith had
some pamphlet that night to be read ; he ge-
nerally henoght papers of some kind. .

Then you heard it read ?—Yes; there was
something read that night.

Did you become a member that night ?—

es,

After you had heard that read ?—There was
nothing read till after I was admitted a
member.

Then you were suddenly converted into
a member; you went there out of mere
curiosity, with no design of becoming a
member, and at once, when Smith started
up, you became a member?—He asked
Whitehorn.

And Whitehorn went from curiosity ?—
No, he belonged to them before, to a society
in Holborn, which I did not know till after-
wards. ‘

When did you go next time P—I missed’two
or three nights. .

You say you attended seven meetings ?—I
think I attended seven times.

Was Yorke there the second time? — No.

Who was there the second time ?—I do net
recollect—Smith was there. .

Did not you become acquainted with the
people who were there, by conversing with
them?—No; I conversed with Ashley, I spoke
to him two or three times. .

You became a member, because you wished
to Propagate their opinions and doctrines ?—
Not at all.

Then in plain English you went there as a
spy:: did you not ?—When I went I did not
know what it was. .

When you became a member, did not you
become 8 member for the purpose of inform-
ing ?—After I knew what they were I did.

‘ad you had any opinions upon the subjec
of a reform ? did you wish a reform of parlia-
ment?---I did not. .

Then why did you become a member if

ou did not wish for a reform in parliament,

ut for the purpose of being a spy f—-When I
became a suamiber I did not know what they
were.

Did you not know they were a society for
parliamentary reform ?—Yes. .

You say you did not wish a W ironing
reform ?—I scarce knew what they meant by
it when they read it over.

Did you wish a parliamentary reform when

you became 4 member, when you heard that

2T

paper read the first night? Now mind; did you
wish a parliamentary reform, or any altera-
tion in the House of Commaans or in the go-
vernment any way ?-— ‘pon your oath (look
across to the jury)—Did you, upon your oath
when you became a member of that society
wish and desire to have any alteration in any
part of the government?~-You need not loo
at me, I shall hear it well enough; why do
you hesitate--come, cough it up, answer me
that upon your oath; are you acquainted with
Mr. Dunn,* of Manchester?—No.

I should have thought you were?

. Lord Chief Justice Eyre.--Why do not you
answer the question ?—I do not understand
you.

Mr. Erskine.—I am sorry for it; I believe
ha are the only one in court that does not:

will put it again to you, because I wish to
be civil to you. Did you wish a parliamen-
tary reform, or any alteration in the
vernment, when you became a member of that
pee PI never wished any thing of the
ind, :

Then upon your oath, why did you become
a member of a society for parliamentary re-
form, if you wished nothing of the kind ?—
The reason of my becomine a member, was,
when I went in, as I said before, Smith asked
Whitehorne if I would not be made 8 mem-
ber; he said no, I had better not to-night;
but Smith urged him, and said make him a
member ; then one got up and read a paper, I
heard him read something, but I did not un-
derstand what he read till after I got the
paper from him; they gave me afterwards
what they read-over, and the ticket.

Then you read it?—I do not kuow I read it
that night,

Did’ you read it before you went there
again ?.—Yes I did,

Then since you took the paper read in the
society home with you, Pati read it in the in-
terval between the first time and the second
time of your going there, you must approve of
it before you went a second time ?--I did not.

You thought there was danger in it ?~-I
read it to two or three of my friends; they
were of the same opinion as myself.

What is become of the paper?—I left it at
Mr. Dundas’s office.

Then you went of course, the second time,
for the purpose of becoming an informer?---
T did; 1 went to see what they were upon.

Between the first and second time you went
to that society, or before you went to it at all,
had you been desired by any body to go for
that purpose ?-—I had not.

Then you went of your own mere motion,
because you wished to be serviceable to the
pipe by going there?---The second time I

id.



When you were there you pretended to be
a friend, no doubt, and to approve of what was
going on?---I did.

Whereas in fact you were a spy?~-So I
proved at last. .

You went the second time in order to be
one ?---I went in order to see what their
plan was,—-what the real grounds of it were.

Did you take down any minutes on paper?
---They would not suffer it. ;

You went again a third time?—I did. _

Was it then that Yorke talked of the pikes?
—No.

They met weekly, did not they ?--- Every
week,

That would extend to near two months;
then of course you can tell us what month it
was in?---The month I went I cannot say.

How long ago; was it in 1793 or 1794?---
In 1793.

Was it winter or summer?—Towards the
latter end of the year. ;

How long before Christmas, think you?—-
T cannot say that; I recollect the day when
Yorke made his speech, I attended twice after
I had been with Mr. Dundas.

Should you know the persons if you saw
then, that attended this meeting at the end
of this year ?--I cannot say ;---I should know
Ashley.

If you saw the countenances of the same
eople that you saw in that room?-——I do nat
now--~I could not swear to them.

Were they gencrally the same people, or
different: people? -— Different people; they
came from ditterent divisions.

How many people do you mean to swear
were in the room that rose up and shook
hands with Mr. Yorke, when he stated what
you have told the jury about bloodshed and
about arms?---To say exactly I cannot re
member ; there might be in the room upwards
of sixty, or between that and an hundred;
the room was as full as it could hold.

I have almost forgot the name of the place?
~--A coffee house in Shire-lane,

Then they all shook hands with Mr. Yorke,
in applause and approbation of what he said?
~—-Yes, they did when he got up to quit the
Toom.

Was that when he was going to Bel-gi-um?

es.

Was that the word he made use of, that
he was going to Bel-gi-um?~-Yes---Beb
gi-am or Bel-gi-um.

Had you heard of that place before ?---No,
nor did not know what it was.

And he said he was: going to head the
French army ?--Yes, he was going to Bel-
Signe to head the French army, and should

e back by Christmas; that he had received a
letter from.a friend of his in Bel-gi-um, thas
they would be ripe by Christmas.

You did this, no doubt, asa lover of your
country mercly ?-—Nothing else.

Nothing else but that?—-No other reason.

Then you went voluntarily, without ever

bemg employed by any body, or desired by
any body ?---There were three of my friends
I mentioned it to, who thought I should do
right, they said, in giving the information.

Who are they ?—-One, his name is Brough-
ton, another isa widow lady, Mrs. Grasswood,
and Mr. Bryant.

How long have you been in business for
yourself ?---I am not in business for myself.

What are you then?---A linen-draper by
profession.

But not for yourself?~-No.

__Whom do you live with?---I am not ina
situation at present.

You are in a very singular situation, I think;
what do you mean by not being ina situa-
tion ?—-Not in employment.

How long is it since you were in employ-
ment ?—In May last.

Where did you live ?—-In Moorfields.

Where there ?—At Mr. Kellerby’s, No. 14,
Finsbury-place.

He is a linen-draper, I suppose ?>—He was

—he has since let his shop to another ;
he carries on the tayloring business.

How long did you live with Mr. Kellerby?
—Five months,

__ When was it you went to him?—I left him
in May—I went to him in December.

You came to him-in December?---In De-
cember.

ae came to him as a shopman, did you?
—Yes.

‘Where did you live before that ?~-At Mr.
Faulder’s, a linen-draper, on Holborn-bridge.

Did you live long there?—-I lived there
almost two years.

Since you last left this Mr. Kellerby, have
you been applying for any other business —

es.

What sort of business? (look across to the

jary)-~-For the same.

mk is a long time in this town, where there
is so much linen and callico, to be out of
business; whom have you applied to, durin,
that time, to be employed?---I have appli
to different people.

To whom?--To Twyman and James, in
Holborn.

Whom else?—-I applied to another person
who has just opened shop; he was going to
open shop, Mr. Marley, in Holborn, with him
I agreed to live, No. 320, facing Gray’s-inn-

te

How happened it you left him ?---Because
I was obligated to attend here.

Then you have lost your business by at-
tending here ?---I have.

Then you are a good patriot, indeed! so
that from a zeal for the truth, and in order to
jane that which you have been proving, you

roke off your agreement with this Mr.
Marley ?---Yes.

What was he to give you a year ?-—Twenty-
five pounds.

How long ago is it since you entered into
this engagement with him?~-Some time
before he opened shop.


You know, I do not know when he opened
shop; when was that?-—-On the twenty-second
of last month, I think.

How long was it before he opened shop,
that you entered into this agreement with
him ?~-I cannot say.

A day or two days?~-A considerable time
before.

How long?--I believe the latter end of
July, or the beginning of August.

Soyou entered into an agreement with him;
when did you go to tell him that you could
not goon with this agreement ?---I told him.

How long ago ?—J told him the day after I
had the subpeena that I must leave him. .

How long ago is it that you had the sub-
peena ?—I had the subpeena last Tuesday fort-

mig
Who subpeena’d you?---Mr. Wood.

Were you told it was necessary that you
should give up your employment for that ?-—-
No.

Did you ask, whether they would ‘allow
you to continue with this linen-draper, and
give ean notice when you should be wanted ?,
-~I did not.

Did you apply to the solicitor of the
treasury, or any body engaged in this prosecu-
tion, to tell them that you had entered into
such an engagement ?-—No.

So you gave up your employment volunta-
rily, because you were wanted here at the
Old-Bailey, for half an hour?-——Yes, for ne
other reason. :

Did you ask Mr. Marley whether he would
consent to take you as his shopman, and allow
you to come here for the purpose of giving
evidence ?—No.

Had you an idea that Mr. Marley would
have refused to permit you to obey the king’s
writ, by coming to give evidence here ?—-For
that continuance oF time that I expected it
would be.

Where is Mr. Marley’s shop ?—In Holborn.

So you mean to swear, that having entered
into an engagement with Mr. Marley, to
receive 25/. a year, you put yourself out of
employ without ever asking him, whether
your attendance here was consistent with his
employment, or asking the solicitor of the ©
treasury, whether he would give you notice
when you would be wanted to give evidence ?
—Yes; I only left him last Friday. .

What reason did you give him?—I said I
was going out of town.

Then you do not speak the truth, I suppose,
unless when you are upon oath ?— Yes, Ido.

Why then did you tell him you were going
out of town ?—Because I expected to be sent
for to Sheffield about Yorke.

How could you expect it when you knew
that this trial was coming on, and you were
subpenaed here?—I expected to go after, as
soon as this was over.

What made you suppose you should be
called to go down to Sheffield as soon as this.
trial was over ?—I only surmised that in my
own imagination.

Mad any body told you you were to be
employed upon that business, after you had
been here upon this job ?—No.

Then what made you think you were to go
down to Sheffield after Mr. Yorke ?——Look
at the jury, do not look so much at me, I have
seen enough of you.—The reason of my
thinking so was, I had been informed before,
that he was expected to have been tried at the
last assizes at York.

“Who informed you so?—Mr. Wood.

You told me a little while ago you did not
know you were to go down; it was only a
surmise of your own mind?-—-Immediately
after this was over.

You have not sought out for any employ-
ment since, have you f—-No.

Where did you live before you lived with
this Mr. Kellerby?---At Mr. Faulder’s.

Where before that?---In Cheapside, with
Mr. Smith.

How long is that ago?—-That is between
four and five years ago.

How Jong did you live with Mr. Smith, in
Cheapside?—I was with him eighteen months,
I believe.

* And left him five years ago?—I do not
know that that is exactly the time-—I left him,
and went in the country for eleven months.

For your health, I suppose ?—-I went to see
my friends.

Where do they live ?—At Washford, near
Salisbury, six miles from Salisbury.

Who are your friends you went to see there?
«--My aunt.

Whatis her name ?—Alexander.

How long did you stay with her?—I was
there eleven fone:

- That is eleven months out of five years,
when you paid your affectionate respects to
your aunt-—What did you do when you came
pack?—Where did you go next?—To Mr.
Marley’s.

That cannot be, you know; for that is five
years ago ?—-I went from Smith’s to Faulder’s.

You know it is five years ago.---It is rather
better than four, I believe.

You lived eighteen months with Mr.
Smith; you went to your aunt’s, and staid
eleven months; when you came back, after
having paid this visit, and after you had lett
Smith, where did you live before you went to
Faulder’s ?—I was with anauntin Old Bedlam.

Another aunt?—Yes, °

Where is Old Bedlam ?--On the other side
Moorfields.

Is her name Alexauder ?—-No, Simpson.

_ How mg did you live with her?—It is
impossible for me to say exactly how long
it was.

Did you live there up to the time; for if you
do not tell me that, I shall ask you where you
did live—did you live with your aunt in Old
Bedlam after you came out of the country up

_to the time you went to Faulder’s? I do not
want to hurry you.---I went to Smith’s when
I retumed from the country; from Smith’s I


went to my aunt’s, in Old Bedlam, and was
there till 1 went to Faulder’s.

I am thrown out quite; you have changed
the whole thing upon me at once—when you
write your life youmust be alittle more correct,
I will just take it down—how long is it ago
since you lived with Smith ?—Rather better
than four years; but I cannot be certain.

What did you leave Smith for?—We had
some words.

Had some words—what might the words
be, think you?—I do not know I am sure
exactly now; we had some words, and upon
that account we parted.

You have an amazing good memory; you
have repeated a whole speech a man made at
a meeting; but you cannot remember the few
words that passed between qo and your
master-~-now try; I will sit down and give
you time.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Why do not you
give an answer ?—] cannotrecollect the words,
it is so long ago.

Mr. Erskine.—Then you do not remember
the words ?—I do not. .

When you have words with a man, it means
you had a quarrel—You know I did not ask
ya what you said to your master, and what

e said to you; but what was the quarrel
about—You must have a strange memory for
a witness—who is to repeat a whole speech,
if you do not remember for what you left
your master—I wish you would look at those
gentlemen ; they are very good looking-men.

Mr. Attorney General.—Mr. Erskine has
said repeatedly, that this witness had repre-
sented that he stated the whole speech that
Mr. Yorke made—I say, that is not only not
correct, but it is very far from correctness.

Mr. Erskine.--I am exceedingly glad to be
corrected, and I shall esteem it no ioterrup-
tion whenever you do; because I am so used
to this work that nothing can put me out—Do
try and recollect what was the nature of the
quarrel between you and Mr. Smith.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Do you recollect,
and if you do, have you any objection to
telling us ?—No.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre-——-Then do you
recollect what you quarrelled with Mr. Smith
about?

Mr. Erskine.—I am entitled to have the
benefit of this gentleman’s deportment~-If
your lordship will just indulge me for one
moment. ! .

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Give him fair
play.*

* Mr. Burnett (Treatise on various branches
of the Criminal Law of Scotland, chapter 18)
thus notices the English method of dealing
with a witness on cross-examination :

“ Nor do we allow that latitude, it may be
termed licence, to counsel in the cross-exami-
nation which is permitted in Eupland, of going
frequently out of the cause, putting whet
questions they please to a witness, in order to try

t


Mr. Erskine---He has certainly had fair
play—-I wish we had as fair play; but that
is not addressed to the Court.

Mr. Attorney General.—-But whom do you

mean?

Mr. Erskine.—I say the prisoner has aright
to fair play.

Mr. Garrow.—But you said it was not said
to the Court.

Mr. Erskine.—-But I am not to be called to
order by the bar—Do youordo you not recollect
what.was the cause of your quarrel with your
master ?-—Some words that happened between
the shopman and me~We had words first,
and then my master and I had some words
on account of it, and then we parted.

What was the nature of the quarrel between
you and the shopman, which led to the
quarrel between you and your master ; because
now you see you begin to recollect it ?—-We
had some high words and he called me, I
said I would not be put upon.

People seldom begin to abuse one another
without some reason ?---We had words—I was
hot as well as him, I suppose—We called one
another fools---I do not know whether we did
not strike one another—he wanted to be
head—I said I would not put up with it.

Who was he ?--.-His name is Williams.

What is his Christian name?—I do not
recollect.

his credit, or, as may be said in many cases,
his temper; by which a plain and honest
witness may be often confounded, and an
irritable one led into indiscretions as unbe-
coming the Court as injurious to the cause of
truth and of justice. Fair and honest wit-
nesses,---those who, to use the language of
the Imperial Rescript, ‘ simpliciter visi sint

sometimes of vexatious prosecutions, and the
rule of evidence that the testimony of one
witmess may in certain cases be sufficient to
convict ; all account for, and perhaps render
necessary, a mode of examination which has
hitherto been little known in Scotland.”

cross-examination that has given rise to a
doubt with some late writers on the English
law, whether examinations in open court are
in every instance preferable to private exami-
nations, taken down in writing. See Evans’s
Appendix to Pothier’s Treatise on Obliga-
tions, p. 236.”~-Burnett on the Criminal
Peake's Law of Evidence, ch. 3, s. 3, pp. 143


Do you know where he went to afterwards?
---I do not.

Have you ever seen Mr. Smith since you
parted from him ?—~-Yes, once.

From Mr. Smith’s did you go to your aunt?
You told me before that you had gone to
your aunt’s, and returned from near Salisbury
to Mr.Smith’s?-~I went to Mr. Smith’s after
returning from Salisbury ; then I went to my
aunt’s in Old Bethlem; there I was till I
went to Mr, Faulder’s.

You are sure it was in the latter end of the
year 1793, that you heard all this about pikes ?

Y.

—Yes. .

What did you hear at the third meeting
you went to?-—I cannot say-—I took no par-
ticular notice of any thing that I heard but
that night.

How long did you stay the third time?.—
Till between eleven and twelve o'clock.

At what time did you go in the evening ?-~
About eight--- between eight and nine.

Pau staid till between eleven and twelve.
—Yes.

Do you recollect any thing said that third
night ?=-I won’t pretend to say I do any night,
except that time that York made his specch ;
that I can recollect particularly—various
things were read over at different times.

What were you doing between the hours of
eight and twelve at night?-~-Sitting there--~
they kept the books open, and they admitted
members, till nine o’clock, I think it was.

How many members were admitted that
night ?—I cannot say.

ut there were some members admitted ?---
I do not know whether any members were
admitted that night—there was in general, of
nights; but the books were cep open for
admission of them till nine o’clock.

But I take for granted, that a great deal
must be said between eight and nine, and
eleven and twelve; because you know you
went there in order to inform ?~-I went there
to hear what they had to say.

In order to inform, you have told us before
—Then did you hear nothing at all?-—I took
no particular notice of any thing.

You went the fourth night---did you?-—Yes.

What time in the evening did you go the
fourth night ?—I suppose about the same time.

And since you went in order to collect in-
formation, you staid, I suppose, till the party
broke up. What was said that night ?---I do
not recollect any thing in particular.

Not a syllable?--- do not recollect any
thing at all.

What time did you go the fifth night P--
About the same time, I suppose.

And staid, of course, till it broke up ?<-
Yes.

Can ‘you recollect nothing that passed that
fifth night ?---I cannot recollect to say in par-
ticular what nights they were—~I think I saw
Mr. Yorke three times there---he came in with
another person---he said they had becn to
Newgate to Mr. Frost, and that he was to

be pilloried the next day---he said he had had
some words with Mr. Kirby.

What did you hear said that night by
Yorke about the pikes?--I never heard Yorke
mention about the pikes that I know of; it
was a person in the room---I do not think
Yorke was there the night the pikes were
mentioned; it was a person came in from
Sheffield, and said, they could get pikes at
sixpence a-piece from Sheffield; another
said, he thought it would do for them as well
as for the people of Sheffield, and it was only
living upon bread and cheese for one day.

So that is all that you can remember in all
the times that you attended ?--I remember
hearing Yorke speak another time about the
army's being deteated, and their having mop-
sticks to defend Frost while he was plored.
. Was this on the seventh night?—I cannot
say.

Thomas Whitehorn sworn.—Examined by Mr.
Bower.

Were you at any time a member of the
London Corresponding Society ?—I was.

ning, the middle, or the end ?—Towards the

What is your profession ?—I am shopman
to a bookseller.

The first time you were there was with the
las* witness, Alexander ?—It was.

Ly you know how Alexander came to go
there ?—I believe we went together.

Did Alexander propose it to you, or you to
him?—I cannot say; but we both went the
same evening, I believe.

te you both admitted the same night ?
—Yes.

How long did _you continue a member ?—I
believe we paid for a quarter that evening—I
was there, to the best of my knowledge, about
four or five times.

Did you see Mr. Yorke there at any of the
times ?—Only once, to the best of my know-

ledge.

How long did you continue a member after
the night you had seen Mr. Yorke there?—I
was not there above once or twice after that.

Have you quitted the society ?—Yes.

How came you to quit it?—I could not
conveniently attend—I left my situation—I
did not know any partic ular reason.

You remember Mr. Yorke being there ?—I
do particularly.

Were there few or many people in the
room at that time?—There might be from forty
to sixty people.

Did Mr. Yorke come in as an ordinary
member, or distinguish himself in any way ?—
He came in as though he had been thcre
bef ore, and seemed to be very well known.

Did he say any thing?—He made a long
speech; I left him speaking, and do not
remember any part of his speech,


Do you mean that there might be forty
people when you came in, or when you went
ra ?--At each time the room was nearly

ull.

Though you do not remember the words of
his speech, perhaps you can recollect enough
to say, whether it was a moderate or violent
speech, or what the subject of it was ?-—He
seemed speaking very loud, but I was at the
farther end of the room from him.

Cannot you take upon you to recollect even:
what the substance of his speech was ?~—No ;
not a sentence I could not swear to.

You were there the first night that the
other witness went with you?—I believe it
was the first night.

Do you recollect, before you went out of
the room, whether any thing was said about
Yorke, about his intentions of either being in
one place or another, about going abroad, or
being at home, or any thing of that kind ?---
I understood something that he was going
abroad

From whom?---I believe he mentioned it
in his speech; I did not mind the particular
words; or whether I understood it from any
body else in the room, I am not certain; but
I understood he was about quitting England.

Whom did you live with at the time you
became a member of this society ?--The late
Mr. William Owen, in Fleet- street.

Where did you go to after that ?---To Mr.
Baxter’s, a bookseller, No. 81, in the Strand.

Do you recollect enough of the speech that
was made by Mr. Yorke on that night, to tell
me what impression it made upon your mind
at that time ?

Mr. Erskine.---This cannot possibly be
evidence.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre---He is able to
give no account at all of it; and as to any
impression upon his mind, certainly youcannot
ask him to that.

Mr. Bower.—-Had you any conversation
with Alexander afterwards about what had
passed there ?---I saw'him a morning or two
after we were there; I believe I might ask
him how long he staid after I left the room,
or something to that purpose.

You say you quitted the society soon after?
—vVery soon after; I believe I was not there
above four times.

What was your reason for quitting the so-
ciety ?—Because I left the situation I was in.

Had you no other reason but that ?—I
lodged at a different part of the town, and had
not time if I had a will to go.

Was your reason entirely because you had
changed your situation, or had you any other
reason besides?—No;'if I had retained my
situation, I should have gone again most
likely.

Have you always said that that was your
reason? Recollect yourself—I do not know
that I have said any thing about it; it was a
matter I never thought to be questioned on,
and never troubled myself about it,

What part of the room were you in—were
you near Mr. Yorke ?—No, quite the reverse.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—How long have
you known Alexander?—Some months; I
cannot say how long.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—What was his
situation ?—He was in a linen-draper’s shop.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—What shop was
he in ?—At the first of my knowledge of him
at Faulder’s at Holborn Bridge.

ber?~I do not know exactly ; it is about two
years ago, or above that.

Were you at any time a delegate, at any
division of that meeting ?—Yes.

What division of the Sheffield meeting

Tow long was that meeting, do you recol-
lect, after the former ?—I cannot recollect.

Do you recollect any thing particular in
Mr. Yorke’s conduct and speech, when
saw him atthe Barrel?—I do not recollect
any thing particular in his speech; he ap-
peared to me to be rather in liquor, at the
time he was there.

eae I saw him at the meeting at the Castle-

bell Brown.

Did he go to Edinburgh in consequence, of
ae appointment of a delegate ?—I believe he
did.

Did you attend upon him ?—I was employ-
ed as hair-dresser to him,

Where did he live at that time?—At one
Mr. Cawthorne’s.

Had you an opportunity, when you were
about Mr. Yorke, to know what he was do-
ing; whether writing any thing ; or what he
was about?—I do not know in particular what
he was about. ;

Did you learn, during the time you attend-
ed Mr. Yorke there, whether any address, or
any thing was going forward that he had any
share in?—I cannot say I did; I saw an ad-
dress afterwards that was said to be wrote by
him.

Were you ever with Mr. Yorke, at any
time when any thing was said about arms ?—
Yes; I was.

What time was that; tellus the circum-


[G56

stances first that happened respecting arms, | tween ourselves, but what passed in public ;

when you have been with Mr. Yorke, and fix
the time when it was?—It was some time in
April, I think.

In April;—tell me what passed in your
presence, at Mr. Yorke's, between Yorke and
you, respecting arms?—I do not know par-
ticularly what passed between him and me;
it was the general talk of the town, at
the time the arms first began making;
and Mr. Yorke and me had spoken about it :
and other people likewise had been there
speaking with him about it.

Who had been there speaking with Yorke
about arms, when you have been with him?
—wNot when I have been with him; but peo-
le that have been there with him, I have

eard them talking about them.

Do you recollect any particular people that
you have heard talking with him about
arms?—I have seen different people there ;
but ldo not know whether those were the
people that had been talking to him about
arms.

Have you had any conversation with Yorke,
or instructions from him, about arms ?—Not
directly with him; I made some myself.

What did you make?—I made a dozen for
Mr. Gale.

Made a dozen of what ?—Of pike-shafts.

Did Mr. Yorke know you were making
them ?—Yes, he did,

You were making some for Gale; did
Yorke know that?—He did.

Did you tell Yorke, or how did he become
acquainted with it?—I do not recollect whe-
ther he spoke first to me upon the subject, or
Ito him; he asked me once or twice, if I had
made them ; I told him I wasmaking them; and
when I had one made, I carried it to him to
ask him, if he thought that size would do for
them; he said he thought it would, or to that

urpose.
ow many did you make ?—About a dozen,
or a dozen and a half.

Did you dispose of them ?—No, not myself.

What became of them?--Mr. Wilkinson
took them.

Mr. Wilkinson is a magistrate there ?—Yes,

Did he seize them all?—I do not know;
they have not been in my house since.

ou only made about that number in the
whole ?—Yes, .

Had you any conversation with Mr. Yorke
respecting the purpose for which these things
were to be made?—Not particularly with him
upon it, more than other people; it was ge-
nerally understood, that it was to act in our
own defence. .

You understood it was to act in your own
defence?—I meant to have one in my own
defence.

Did Mr. Yorke say any thing to you about
a reform in parliament ?—Yes,

‘ What passed between him and you, res-
pecting the reform in parliament that was
sought for?—We never had much about it be-

he has chiefly delivered his sentiments io
public about it.

Have you ever had conversation with him
in private about it ?—I have.

Did you understand from him, what he
meant bya reform in parliament?—Yes,

What did he tell you ?—By way of univer-
sal suffrage.

How came that conversation between you ?
—I do not know; it wasa thing that was of-
ten spoken of,

Did Yorke know what you meant by a
reform in parliament?—We all understood
each other, as I always understood, that we
were all for universal suffrage.

When you say we, whom do you mean ?—
All the society. .

Did you inform Mr. Yorke that it was what
you understood by it? —I do not recollect
particularly informing him, that that was my
meaning, because it was a matter generally
agreed upon among us, and so there was not
much disputing about the mode of reform.

In the conversations you had with Mr.
Yorke, did you and he uniformly agree about
what you meant by a reform in prlanly e
or did you differ?—We agreed till some tew
weeks before Mr. Yorke lett Sheffield the last
time.

In what did you disagree with him?—I
disagreed with him in respect of universal suf-

frage. .

Did you tell Yorke so?—I did.

What said Yorke to that ?—As near as I can
recollect, I told him, when I went one morn-
ing to dress him as usual, that I thought the

lan of reform we were upon would not do:
he asked my motives for it: I told him, I
thought it would carry us too far.—Well, says
he, I have studied it some time myself; I
have read various authors upon the subject ;
and I cannot see that any reform will be of
service to the nation, except that.—Very well
then, says I, so far youand I differ in opinion,
and I will no longer subscribe my name to any
thing that tends to universal suffrage.—Very
well, he said, then you must give it up; and
there the conversation broke up.

After that, did you continue to have the
same sort of communication with Mr. Yorke,
upon the subject, that you had had before,
when you told him your ideas did not go to
the length of universal suffrage ?—No ; t
very little conversation with him after that, it
was very seldom that I had much conversa-
tion with him upon the subject, when I was
with him, for my stay was generally Short.

After that you had not the same kind of
communication ?—No.

How long was this before Mr. Yorke left
phetiekt i—Perhaps two or three weeks be-
fore.

Do youremember the meeting in the open
a5 at Sheffield, in the month of April?—

es. ‘
Were you present at that meeting >—Yes.

" Was Mr. Yorke there ?—He was.
Did Mr. Yorke make a speech there?—
Yes; he spoke at considerable length.

Did you hear any part of his speech ?—Yes ;
Ih a good deal of it. =
After that meeting did you go to see Gale?

— Yes; I had seen Gale after that.

Had you any conversation with Gale or
Yorke about being paid for the shafts you had
made ?—Yes.

Were you paid for them?—No.

Whom did Yorke tell you to apply to for
payment ?—He did not say in particular who

was to apply to for the payment.

Who was to pay you ?—Those people that
took them of me, I expected to pay me.

Did you make them then for sale ?—Yes.

Did any person buy any ?—No.

You do not know that the magistrates seized
them, do you?—They told me so.

You have said you had only some private
conversations with Mr. Yorke, but that he
held many other conversations that were not
private with you; you have often heard

im converse upon these subjects with other
persons, not private?—I have ‘beard him speak
with different people, who have been along
with him at different times.

What have you heard him say to any of
these persons you have seen him with, upon
arms, of any description ;--du you knew Da-
vison ?—Yes.

Have you ever seen him with them ?—No.

He was a member of the society ?—Yes.

Have you heard Davison say any thing re-
specting arms, or providing arms /—Davison
‘was a customer of mine, and he and I fre-
quently spoke about them.

A customer of yours; in what way ?—In
the hair-dressing business.

Had you any directions from Davison, at
any time, respecting those shafts ?—Yes.

What conversation had you with him?—
He did not give me to understand, that any
particular orders were given for them; only
that the people in general began to call out
for them; that they thought themselves in
danger, from the state of the people’s minds
at that time.

That Davison told you?—Yes. :

You understood it was for your own de-
fence ?—Yes:

Had you any of the books, as a delegate of
this society Yes.

They are not here, I believe?—No; I be-
Jieve not.

George Widdison cross-examined by Mr.
Erskine.

You seem a decent man; you were two
a member of this society ?—Yes.

a. ah eathin. & ak meek of bast time

at you have speaking of, been
of the same opinion with the restof the society
for universal su: ?—Yes, I had.

‘Were you a friend of your king ?—-Undoubt-
edly ; and of the queen, both.



As far as you could collect from the eonver-
sation and behaviour of these people, with
whom for two years you had associated, and
who were for universal suffrage, did the
pear to you to be people that loved the k
—Yes, in general.

I ask you, as an honest man, would you
have continued for two years in that society, if
you had not had reason to believe, from all
as saw and heard, that they were people that
loved their king?—No; I would not have
continued with them, if I had thought they
acted from other motives.

You did not think that universal suffrage
was inconsistent with love to your king?—
Undoubtedly not.

What was generally understood by univer-
sal suffrage: and who were the people after
which your society stated that they copied, in
their desire of universal suffrage ?—The first
resolution that we came into, in that business,
was what we took from the duke of Rich-
mond’s plan. @

Of universal suffrage ?—Yes.

Hed you any of the publications, at that
time, of the duke of Richmond’s ’—Yes;. a
good many.

Do you remember 2 letter to colonel Shar-
man that was published ?—Yes ; that wasinit.

Should you know it, if I were to show it
you ?—Yes.

Was itever read in the society?—Yes; I
believe it has been.

Did you ever hear it read?—Yes: I have
heard it read several times, and I think I have
heard it read once or twice in the society.

Was it generally approved of ?—Yes, at
the time that we adopts it.

Is that it? [showing the witness a printed
copy of the duke of Richmond’s Letter to co-
lonel Sharman}. Should you recollect, if I
were to read this part of it to you? Do
you recollect this?--“ The subject of a parlia-
mentary reform is that which, of all others, m
my opinion, most deserves the attention of
the public, as I conceive it would include every
other advantage which a nation can wish ; and
I have no hesitation in saying, that, from
every consideration which I have been able
to give to this great question, that for many
years has occupied my mind, and from every
day’s experience to t present hour, I am
more and more convinced, that the restoring
the right of voting universally to every man,
notincapacitated by nature, fér want of reason,
or by law, for the conmission of crimes, toge-
ther with annual elections, is the only reform
that can be effectual and permanent; I am
further convinced, that it is the only reform
that is practicable.””"—Yes, that is it; I have '
read it frequently.

Now I ask you, upon your oath, whether,
as far as as you know (what passes in the
heart of another man you cannot tell), but as
far as you have collected from the conversa-
tion of the Tre in general with whom
associated, did it appear to you, and did

2U

ing?

ey

express themselves, that this was their ob-

ject ?—Yes.

Did it appear to you, that there was ay
disposition in those with whom you associated,
to compel this by force of arms ?—I never un-
derstood it so.

Was it from any fear of that sort, or because
you changed your mind on the idea of univer-
sal suffrage, you thought it not so good a plan?
ae did not think the people’s minds prepared

for it.

Do you still continue to think as you did,
provided people's minds were prepared for it?
—When I read that, I looked upon the plan
that was laid down so clear, that I thought it
could be done without any kind of confusion,
pvaed the people were acquainted with it ;

ut from circumstances since, and upon more
anature reflection, I had reason to believe they
were not; and it was from the same convic-
tion, that I dissented from it, though I at first
approved of it.

_ Were you a member of this society at the
time they sent their delegate to Scotland >—
Yes, I wasat that time, and some time after-
wards, :

Did you think you were doing any harm
when you consented to the sending of that
delegate?—I did not consent to it—I happen-
ed to be too late, or, I believe, [ should have
given my consent; but I should not have
thought I was doing any harm in it.

What was the understanding of the people
of that society of the nature of that which was
to be done in Scotland, to which they sent
their delegate ?—I never understood that they
had any other object in view than of drawing
up an address to the nation, and likewise a
petition to the government, the parliament, or
some other branch ofit.

Did you ever hear any of them say, that
petitioning from private societies of men
could not be supposed to have such an effect
upon parliament?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Do not put the
very words in the witness’s mouth,

Mr. Erskine—yYour lordship recollects I
am in a cross-examination.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—You are not to
put the very words in his mouth, even on a
cross-examination,

Mr. Attorney General.—It is a misfortune
that that has been the course.

Mr. Erskine.—It has been usual so to exa-
mine on a cross-examination in the court in

-which I practice.*

_* The system thus sanctioned in England
differs from that which prevails in Scotland,
as appears by the following extract from Mr.
Burnett’s Treatise :—

“ Asto the mode of examining witnesses,
it is only necessary to observe, that it has
been all along a rule in our practice, not to
permit leading questions to be put to wit-
nesses; that is, such as from the form in
which they are put, clearly imply and point


Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I will not stop
you, but it is contrary to my practice and my
opinion.

Mr. Attorney General.—I hope your lord-
ship will give us the same law on our side.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—In a cross-exa-
mination certainly.

Mr. Erskine—I will conform myself as
near as I can to your lordship’s wish.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I would not ky
down a stricter rule in a case like this than
has usually prevailed—you say it has been
your usual practice.

Mr. Attorney General.—Those gentlemen
who assist me, and who practise in the same
court, say it is not so.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I think if you
will examine the witness, so as that we may
have his own answers, instead of echoing
your words, it will have ten times more effect
with the jury.

Mr. Erskine.—I will do it with pleasure.
Do you recollect any thing being said about
the expediency of petitioning parliament from
private bodies of men ?—I do not understand
what you mean by private bodies of men; I
always understood that it was in public
bodies that we petitioned; our matters were
always public.

Was it ever expressed by any body, or
from any thing that passed in your presence
in the society, previous to, and at the time of
sending the delegate to Scotland, that they
were to assume all the functions of parlt
ment, and be themselves a parliament By
nomeans; I never understood it in that light.

Was there any thing said by any of them,
as if that was their conception and their
plan ?—No ; I never understood it so.

Would you have been a party to any such
thing, if you had understood it so?—No, I
hope not.

Then did it appear to you, from what you
collected (we know there might be bad men
in any society) but from what you collected
in general of the disposition of your society,
from what you heard them say, and the sort
of people they were—did you then, and do
you now, consider them to be people attached

out to the witness the answer which is wished
for, as ‘did not you see, &c.?’ or ‘ wast not so ¥"
Neither do we make any distinction in this
matter between a willing or an unwilling wit-
ness ; nor between the cross and chief exami-
nation, as was expressly found in the case of
Stevenson and others for theft, 28 November
1808 ; differing in this from the practice in
England, which allows leading questions to
be put in the cross-examination.”— Burnett
on the Criminal Law of Scotland, ch. 18,
. 465.

to their king, at the same time that they were
attached to their own freedom?—I ulways
looked upon them in the same light.

Are you speaking now your own senti-
ments? — Yes, not only mine, but what I
understood were the sentiments of those I
was associated with.

Then you look upon them as persons at-
tached to their king?—Yes; because I always
looked upon it that the king's preservation
and the liberties of the people were insepara-
ble; and I believe that was the general idea
of the people that were concerned in the so-
ciety, that conducted it, most, if not all of

em.

That the king’s preservation, and the li-
berty of the bees were inseparable ?—I al-
ways unders it in that light.

Was any thing said about arms for the pur-
pose of resisting the laws that are under his
Mayjesty’s execution ?—I never heard it men-
tioned in that light.

*Was any thing ever said in your society
concerning arms for attacking the king’s ma-
jesty, and putting down the laws which he
was to execute ?—Not in my hearing.

‘Was what was said about arms at the time
the hand-bill was put out?—I do not remem-
ber arms being spoken of in the society; it
was generally spoken of in conversations we
bad in each other’s houses.

When you madea pike for yourself, what
did you make it for?—To defend myself pro-
vided it should be necessary.

What made you collect at that time, about
the month of April, that it was likely you
should want arms for your defence ?—Because
there was not so good an understanding be-
tween the two parties as there was before.

Whom do you mean by the two parties ?—
The one, us who were for universal suffrage,
the other, who opposed it.

Had you any intention, in making a pike
for yourself, to detend yourself against the
magistracy of the country, or those people
who mightillegally attack you ?—Only against
those people who might come without any
legal authority from the magistrate, or from
the government.

From what you knew of the sentiments of
the other persons of the society, did it appear
to you that that was the gencral notion ?—
Yes, I always understood it so; because we
have many times been threatened in different
companies that we have been in.

Do you mean that you had been threaten-
ed with personal violence >—Yes, I have my-
self in different companies that I have fre-
quented; I have heard them remark, those
whom we generally looked upon as aristo-
crats, or whatever name you might give
them, some of the violent ones; that if any
thing should happen, that if an invasion
should take place in this country, they would
destroy their enemies at home first. I have
heard that alleged against me and my friends
frequently.


What answer did you make when you
heard that alleged against you and your
friends ?—I do not know in particular what
reply I have made; sometimes perhaps I
have said, that I hoped that was not the ge-
neral disposition of them; if it was, we should
be under the necessity at least of taking
means to be prepared for them, or to that
effect. .

Then you, and those with whom you asso-
ciated, were well disposed to the government
and the constitution of your country ?—Yes;
I never had any intention of altering it, and
never understood that that was the intention
of the society. .

Who was it, if there was an invasion in the
country, that said they would make an attack
upon the others?—That their party would;
that they would follow the example of the
French,

And attack you and your associates ?—Yes.

From any thing that passed in your society
relative to their wish of universal suffrage,
was there any thing said against the Lords’
House of Parliament, or only that you wanted
universal suffrage in the Commons ?—That
very rarely forined any part of the conversa-
tion with respect to the House of Lords, and
the only three pamphlets I ever saw upon it
were wrote by major Cartwright: he proposed
some alterations in respect of representation
of the House of Lords, with respect to filling
them up by representation.

That was the only book you ever read upon
the subject ?—Yes.

But that was no part of the plan of your so-
ciety ?—No, I never uaderstood that that was
adopted ; that that was apy part of our plan.

Upon the whole, am I to understand you
that you continue still attached to the king
and constitution?—Yes. :

You say you saw Mr. Yorke once when he
was drunk ?—No, he was not drunk; but did
not appear tu be so sober a man as generally
he is. .

Have you often seen Mr. Yorke attending
at your mectings which you have been speak-
ing of?—I have seen him at public meetings
some few times. .

With the exception of the time when he was
a little in liquor, as you say, how did he con-
duct himself in his conversations ?—Gene~
rally very well, from what I saw or heard of
him; he used to get a little warm in conver-
sation now and then.

George Widdison re-examined by Mf. Bower.

I observed you said, that, in general, you
thought people who were desirous of univer-
sal suffrage, were well affected to the kin
you said, that you understood so in general.
You heard Mr. Yorke’s speech; now did it
strike you that he was one of those people
who were well affected to the king? .

Widdison.—The speech at the Castle-hill,
do you mean?

Mr. Bower.—Yes.

Widdison.—1 had not sufficient reason to
think he was otherwise.

At other times, from his conversation, did
you imagine him one of those persons who
were well affected to the constitution and go-
vernment?—I bad never reason to suspect
Dtherwise.

Did you happen to know that there had
been a communication between Davison and
some persons in London, about sending arms
to London ?—I_ never knew it till I saw the
letter published in the Benepe
; When was that?—In the latter end of May
fast.

Was that published at Sheffield?—Yes, in
@ newspaper, at Sheffield, and in a London
paper, I believe.

Till that time you never knew that there
had been any communication between Shef-
field and London about arms ?—No.

You never knew that the convention had
any other object but to petition parliament
for the alteration wanted ?

Widdison.—Do you mean the English or
- Scotch Convention?

Mr. Bower.—The Scotch.

Widdison.—I never understood they had
any other object. .

You never understood that the society had
any other object in sending a delegate there,
than for effecting a reform in parliament ; that
was what you understood !—Yes.

Were you there when the thanks of the
Sheffield society were voted to Mr. Paine?—
Yes, I was a member of it at the time.

Were you present when the thanks were
voted ?—I cannot remember.

* Have you read Mr. Paine’s books then?—

'

es.

Then I may take it you are of opinion, after
reading those books, that the thanks of the
society were given to the author of that work
by people properly attached to the king and
constitution ?—Yes.

Mr. Bower.—Then I will not trouble you
with any farther questions.

Henry Hill sworn.—Examined by Mr. Law.

What are you?—A cutler.

You live at Sheffield ?—Yes.

Were you at any time a member of the
Constitutional Society at that place?—Yes.

When did you begin to be a member of it?
As soon as it was instituted, the second or
third night.

In what year was it instituted?—I think in
the year 1792, but cannot be Positive.

How long did you continue a member of
that society p's near twelve months, as
mear as I can recollect.

Do you remember during the time you
were a member of that society, Mr. Yorke’s
visiting the society >—Yes, onces
_ Do you remember when that was?—I think
in the year 1792.

Do you remember the meeting on the Cas-
tle- hill ?—Yes,


When was that ?—That was in last Apri

Do you remember the lecture on the Fast-
day ?—Yes.

That was in February, 1794 ?—Yes.

Do you remember after this lecture had
been given on the Fast-day, any talk in the
town about arms?—Not till some time after
that.

Do you remember the meeting of the 7th
of April, 1794 ?-—Yes.

Abvut that time, was there any conversa-
tion prevalent in the town about providing
yourselves with arms ?—Yes.

Do you know Davison ?—Yes,

What is he ?—A printer.

He worked for Gale ?—Yes.

Mr. Yorke lodged at Gale’s at one time,
did he not ?—I cannot tell, he did not at that
time.

Had you an application from Gale, to make
any blades for pikes ?—Yes.

When ?—In the beginning of April.

Did he order any particular number ?—No.

What orders did he give you respecting the
making of them?

Hill.— Do you mean in the size and
number?

-_ Mr. Law.—In both.—He brought a bayonet
for me as a pattern to make them by, I made
“a in a bayonet shape, and Davison approved
of it.

Did he tell you where. you were to get the

iron; did you take it upon his credit or your
own ?—Upon his credit.

Who was to pay you for the workmanship?
— Davison.

Did that pike you made from that model
meet Davison’s approbation? — He did ap-
prove of it.

Did you carry it to Camage’s?—It was in
Camage’s house he saw it.

Did you ever meet Yorke at Camage’s ?—
No, I was desired by Davison to go to Yorke.

Did you go to him ?—Yes.

Did you show him any of those blades *—
Yes.

What did he say about them?P—aAt the
time I went to him, he had pst received an
account of Mr. Walker's trial, at Manchester,
and he was so overjoyed, that he had v.
little to say then about the blade that
showed him.

Did he approve of it?—He had little to
say; [donot know whether he said any thing,
he was so overjoyed.

He was going off to Manchester then?—
No.

At any subsequent time, had you any con-
versation with Yorke, about those —
No.

You said he was overjoyed, what was he
overjoyed at?— At being liberated in that
indictment with Mr. W: , and Dunn pe
nished ; Dunn was put into prison.*

He said nothing upon that otcasion res-


pecting the pike ?—Not as I remember now.

Did you ever see him afterwards, with a

ike properly mounted upon a shaft in his
and ?—Yes,

When was that, how long after ?P—It was
sometime after, perhaps a fortnight or three
weeks; I cannot justly tell when.

Did he make any observations upon that
pike, so prepared and mounted ?—As little as
possible; there were some soane et in the
room that he was very fond of, he took it in
his hand, and pretended to give it a push at
one of them. : mal

Did Davison apply to you to make an
' greater number of pikes afterwards 2—Noy
when he first gave me orders, I was to make
60 long as he employed me.

To what number did you go on making ?—
About a hundred and twenty, or a hundred
and thirty.

Did Davison take up these and pay you
for them P-—He paid me for some of them.

Had he the whole of that hundred and
thirty °—Yes.

Where did you use to carry them to when
you had ‘made them ?—Sometimes I took
them to my own lodgings, sometimes to Wil-
liam Camage’s.

Did you deliver them to Davison at Wil-
liam Camage’s ?—If he was there I delivered
them to him, if not I left them there.

What pay had you for the workmanship ?
—Two-pence a piece.

23 saw Davison’s letter to the prisoner ?
oe id. .

And read it?—I did not read it, but heard
him read it.

Did he say any thing after he read it, re-
specting any demand there might be from any
other quarter for those pikes, Loudon, or any
where else ?—There was some little conver-
sation about it, but I cannot recollect what it

was.

Did he express any expectation of an order
from any other place, for pikes of the same
sort ?—He said he did not know but there
might be the same need for them in London,
as there was in Sheffield.

Whiat did you understand to be the ose
for which they were prepared at Shefheld,
and which might make them likewise wanted
in London?—To act upon the defensive, in
vase they should be attacked by an unlawful
set of men.

This letter was to the prisoner at the bar,
as secretary of the Corresponding Society, 1
u ?—I do not know, I did not look
at the direction. ’

S Pavnon say whom they expected would
attack them ?—The opposite party that were
in Shefticld. sila ated

But in London who was-to attack them ?
~I cannot say any thing about that, there
would be the same occasion in London I sup-
pose as in Sheffield, if there should be the
same necessity. : ;

That they should be attacked in’ London


by the same, or similar people as in Sheffield?
If they thould be attacked.

How soon after your.delivering these hun-
dred and thirty pikes to Davison did he ab-
scond—when did he leave Sheffield ?—I think
about the middle of May, if I can recollect
right.

Henry Hill cross-examined by Mr. Gibbs,

You say you were a member of the C
stitutional Society, from the time that they
first came together ?—Yes.

I suppose you would not have been a
member of that society, if you had not sup-
posed it would have been faithful to the king ?
—Certainly not.

Had you ever any intention in becoming a
member of that society, to endeavour to dis-

lace the king from his throne ?—No, I never
eard a syllable of the sort at Sheffield.

Do you suppose that was the view of any
of those who were members of the society?
—I never heard them declare it was, they
were always friendly to the king for any
thing that ever I saw by them; I never saw
any thing to make me think the contrary.

What reform was it they wished to have
brought about ?—A more eve representation
in the Commons House of Parliament, as I
understood it. .

Whose plan of reform in parliament did
they follow?—They followed the duke of
Richmond's plan, as I understood there were
a number of letters distributed in Sheffield.

Did you hear the members of this society"
say, that they formed themselves upon the
duke of Richmond’s plan, that they followed
his pa ?—Yes, I have heard that said se-
veral times.

There were some pikes prepared at Shef-
field; what was the reason of your prepering
them P-—From the opposite party using
threats, even in the dead of the night, they
have come where I lodged and insulted us of
a night when we have been in bed, and tuve
sworn they would pull down the house and
burn it, calling us Jacobins, and calling the
house Jacobin-hall, because the society used
to meet there, some <ivisions of it before I
went there.

And you had actual reason to expect dan
ger from them ?—Yes, by their threats, they
have even shot into people’s houses, an armed
set of people that made a parade in the
street; and when going home at twelve
eer at night, they shot under a person's

oor.

This was an armed set of people at Shef-
field ?—They procured arms and paraded the
street, and if there were any great vietory
gained — .

Upon some occasion of this sort, they fired
through or under one of the doors ?—They did.

Was it this sort of conduct, and those
threats, that induced you first to prepare
arms ?—No other thing, no other view.

Had you, or any of: people of Sheffield,


a view of attacking the magistracy of the
country with those arms you prepared ?—No,
far from it.

Were they then meant merely for your
own defence?——Merely for self-defence.

And for no other purpose ?—For no other
purpose, that ever I knew.

Henry Hill re-examined by Mr. Law.

Before you prepared these pikes for self
defence, did it never occur to you to mention
to Mr. Wilkinson, a magistrate in the neigh-
bourhood, that you were in need of this de-
fence, if you should be attacked ?—I do not
know that ever there wasany complaint to him.

Do you know Mr. Althorp ?—No.

Did you make a complaint of the danger
which you were in to any other person that
you can name?—I do not know that any
complaint was made to a magistrate.

Or to any other person that you can name ?
—No.

You have said you were well affected to the
King, and that you had no objection to the
House of Lords, that you only wanted to ef-
fect a reform in the Commons House of Par-
liament?—Yes,

Were you present at the time thanks were
voted to Mr. Paine for his works ?—No.

Do you know that a vote of that sort was
come to by your society ?—I do not know any
thing about it. -

You do not in fact know that any such vote
was come to hy your society ?~— No, I do not
know any thing about it.

Robert Moody, sworn.---examined by
Mr. Garrow,

You are a joiner at Sheffield ?---Yes.

Were you amember of the Constitutional
Society formed in that place ?—I was not a
regular member for above a twelvemonth be-
fore I was apprehended.

Besides the general meetings of the society,
had they any meetings which were called dis-
trict meetings, division meetings ?—They had.

Did you know a person of the name of
Henry Yorke ?--Yes,

Did you ever see him attending at any of
the meetings ?---I have seen him at some of
the public meetings.

. In what character did he act?--Asa speaker
and orator whenever I saw him.

Did you ever see him act as chairman?—-

es.

When you say you saw him in the character
of an orator, do you mean you saw him ad-
dressing the people ?—Yes.

Where ?-—I saw him at a meeting at the
Castle-hill, and one or two other meetings.

How many people might be present at the
cael ?-—-I think not less thas ten thou-
sand. ;

Upon that occasion you heard Mr. Yorke
speaking to the persons assembled there?---

es. .

Were you near enough to hear and collect


distinctly the substance of what he said ?---
No, I was at a distance. .

Did you stay till the business was con-
cluded ?---Yes.

In what way did he go home to his apart-
ment?---A coach was brought, the horses
were taken out, and the populace drew him
home.

Do you remember a person of the name of
Camage being there at that time ?—Yes.

Did you hear him read any resolutions ?-—I
saw him up reading something which I un-
derstood to be the resolutions; I afterwards
saw some resolutions in the Sheffield paper.

Was that newspaper printed by Gale?—It
was.

Did Broomhead act as secretary to that
meeting ?-—He did. .

Did you after that see Camage upon the busi-
ness at your shop ?~-Yes, he came one une
and brought me four or five pike blades an
spoke to me to make three dozen of handles.

Who came with him when he came to you?
-—There was a person with him, I do not re-
collect who. a .

Did the person who came with him bring
any?---I donot kuow whether each had some,
or one brought all the parcel. .

How many blades might Camage bring to
you upon the whole to be fitted into handles ?
~-There were blades enough to answer the
shafts he had ordered, three dozen.

Did you learn from Camage what the pur-
Pose was for which those pikes were to be
made ?---No, I had no orders from him but
just to make them, I did not inquire any thing
about the purpose they were for. :

., Who were the persons in general that were
furnished with those pikes ?-—I never knew
who they were for, but I understood by Cam-
age, that a man of the name of Davison was
to take them from him,:or he had chaps
for them so far asI should be paid ly
money for them when they were done.

Did you Jearn in the society from members
of it for what purpose those pikes were made?
~I did not, know farther than what I could
collect and supposing from what I could cole
lect, that they were for self-defence. .

Self-defence against whom ?—Against peo-
ple by whom they supposed they might be
illegally attacked, for geports (and only reports
as Tinow of) nad said that they should be dis-
persed ; they had met frequently in large
meetings, and many of the opposite opinion
said, that they should be dispersed, and how
far they might influence a justice of the peace
or any bi pte give them any authority, we
supposed a little matter might have done it:
they might have used some means which
they supposed must be injurious to some of
the parties, and they got these, as they wished
to defend themselves in casc they should be
illegally attacked.

jo you recollect any conversation about the
time of any of your public meetings, with re-
spect to the dragoons which were in the

neighbourhood of Sheffield ?---Yes, I remem-
ber so far that it was said ——

Mr. Erskine.---Said by whom?

Mr. Garrow.---Was it said by Camage, or
any of the members of the society P—I do
not know by whom, butI have heard itsaid.—

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---Heard it said,
where, by what people ?---Some people in
town, who I cannot tell; it was a report, it
might be true, or might be false.

Ar. Garrow---To which of those meetings
did the conversation about dragoons apply,
was it to that upon the Castle-hill?

Mr. Gibbs.---He is asked to what meeting
itapplied, whether it applied to that at the
Castle-hill!

Lord Chief Justie Eyre.-~The question is
Mot quite so correct as it should be, because
che phieet is to see, to which meeting it ap-
plied.

Previous to the meeting at the Castle-hill,
and how long previous to that, had there been
any conversation about the dragoons?-—I
know ofnone before that.

After that mecting at the Castle-hill, did
you hear from Camage, or from any other
member of your society, any conversation re-
specting the dragoons in the neighbourhood
of Sheffield ?---Not from any of the society, I
do not know who it might be from that I
heard it.

_ When you were in Camage’s shop at any
time, did you see any leaden instrument, or
inodel of an instrument ?---I did.

What was it ?--It was what was called to
me, in the privy council, a night-cat; it was
called when it was shown to me a cat.

What passed at the time that that cat so
called, was shown you in Camage’s shop ?---
Itwas lying in the window; I took it up and
examined it to see what it was, and asked
what that was ; he told me as he had been told
I suspose, he said it was an instrument’ that
was, or might be made use of to throw in the
streets ; it would lie pointed upwards, which
would prevent horses from travelling in the
streets.

Did it seem to you, that the instrument was
well enough calculated to do what he stated it
had, or might have done ?---It did,

At any ee it presented a point ?---Yes.

Where did he state he had been told such
an instrument had been used ?---He never
Sane that any such instrument had been

of deal.

That is not shod, is it?—No, nothing but _
the wood.

_ Nor loaded, is it ?~--No, there is nothing
in it.

Do you remember Mr. Davison maki
any application to you with respect to letters
—-Yes; [remember him asking me to leta
letter or two be directed to be left with me for
him ; I told him he might if he pleased direct
his correspondent to direct his letters to be
left with me; Ido not know any thing more
about it, for I never had any letters. '

That blade fits into the hoop at the top
and takes out occasionally, does it not ?---No, ’
it is fastin.

son’s correspondence in London, upon the
subject of pike-blades ?---No, I know that I
did not know of any of his correspondents.

You did not know of that letter that he

Robert Moody.—Cross-examined by
Mr. Erskine.

IfI understand youright, Davison had writ-

decent, well-behaved people ?—Yes, I always
endeavoured to get into the company of those
who were better informed than myself, in
order that I might get improved.

You say that it was: about the month. of
April that they first began to see about these
pikes?—It was.

Was there ever any thing said about pikes,

on that frightened you?—No, I never heard

you right ?—It might be so, or they might
take upon themselves to disperse us without
the authority of a magistrate.

In either case those instruments were to be

! used for your defence ?—If it was found ne-

cessary.

About this cat, as it was called; supposing
a number of these cats, not made of lead as

Mr. Erskine.-—Does your lordship take it,

Mr. Garrow.—-I submit it is evidence.

Mr..Erskine.—I submit to the Court, that

Mr. Gerrow.—Nor shall I. '

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—I consider tha

meetings of the Cersesponding Society, in
what dress those persons who attended

Tuns, on Snow-bill, to the number of sixteen,

one evening about sixteen persons met.

Were you one ?—I was, .

What was the purpose of that meeting ?—I

had spoke to several of the members myself,

Association, but no person would.
i No person would agree to that proposal ?—
No.
Were those sixteen members of the divi-
sion No, 22?—I do not know what divisions
they were members of; they were of several
divisions, I believe.

When was it that that meeting was held at


Refore or after the anniversary dinner ?—
Before that a long while.

In the London Corresponding Society was
there any committee, which was called the
secret committee, for dispatch of business >—
I understood there was.

Did you understand, from any of the mem-
bers of | the society, that there was ?—Yes.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Sixteen people
met; what was done there ?—Nothing at all.

Mr. Garrow.—At that meeting, where six-
teen were present, what was Proposed by any
body ?—I only proposed the forming an asso-
ciation similar to that of Franklow’s, as I
mentioned, and no person there would join
in it.

In what manner was the secret committee
of the society chosen ?—I cannot tell in what
manner they were chosen; I only heard it in
the division.

Did you, in that division, hear of the ap-
pointment of any secret committee, which
was afterwards dissolved ?—This was the same
committee, the secret committee, that I heard
mention of in the division. ‘

Was that secret committee supplied by any
new committee ?—I understood it was;
that committee that was dissolved had full
powers to choose another.

What was the reason, as it was stated in
the division meetings, for dissolving that
secret committee which had existed, and
giving full powers to that secret committee to
choose a new one ?—It was thought that
some person had given information of that
committee having been chosen.

Was that person who was suspected, a
member of the society ?—He was a member,
I understood, of the general committee.

What was his name ?-—Lynam.

Did you ever know who the persons were
that constituted that new committee P—The
persons that they chose on the committee
there, were five persons; I do not know that
T could recollect all their names.

Should you know their names, if they were
stated to you?---I think I should.

Do yeu know John Martin, an attorney ?—
Yes.

Was he one?—-Yes,

Do you know John Thelwall ?—Yes.

Was he one ?-—Yes.

them both.

Was one or the other a member of this
secret committee ?-—He was.

Where did this sccret committee meet, as
you learned in the meetings of the Corres-
ponding Society ?---I do not know.

At what sort of places did they meet; at

the Three Tuns, Snow-hill ?—I cannot recol- | the ordinary placcs of meeting of the general

lect when it was,

meetings of the society, or in private houses ?
---I do not know.

Do not you know, from the information of

the society?—-I understood that they met at
. their own houses.

Did you understand that in the society ?~-
No; 1 was told by a person not in the
society.

What was the office of this secret commit-
tee; what had they to do?—To receive any
letters that were sent.

And what were they to do with them, wlicn
they ‘had received them ?—-That was all left
to them; it was kept a sccret from the
society.

Did they communicate to the society, occa-
sionally such correspondence as came to them?
—At times they used to have letters read in
the division.

Was it left to them to use their discretion
about that ?-—I understood so.

Were you at any time a delegate of the
society ?---1 was.

In the character of a delegate were youa
member of the general committee ?~-I at-
tended the general committee about six times.

You were not a member of the secret com-
mittee ?—No.

Do I understand you right, that the corres-
pondence was committed to the secret com-
mittee, and left with them, whether it should
be brought before the general committee, or
the society at large at their discretion ?—It is
impossible for me to answer that, because it
ajl remained a secret to themsclves.

Have you any reason to know from any of
the proceedings of the society, that correspon-
dences which did find their way to the secret
committee, were not communicated either to
the general committee, or to the socicty at
large ?—That I cannot tell.

Where did the general committee at first
meet ?-—In Compton-strect.

At number 3, the cofice room ?-—I think it
was number three.

Were you ever present at Compton-street ?
Sometimes I have been there.

How often might you be there ?---Twice.

Was it any part of the business of the ge-
neral committee of delegates that met at
Compton-strect to receive the return of new
members ?-—Always from every delegate.

Did it happen that at all those meetings you
attended, there were returns of new members ?
-—When a delegate attended, the rcturns were
made at a general committee.

From Compton-street, were the meetings of
the committee transferred to any other place?
--To Beaufort-buildings.

. To whose house ?-— Mr. Thelwall’s.

. Do you know from any thing that passed
at apy of the meetings of this society at large,


that your socicty was in correspondence, and

co-operation with the Constitutional Society ?

Thursday night following, that a committee

of correspondence was appointed by the Con-

stitutional Society of six persons, and I also

understood, that a deputation had been ap-

pointed to the Society for Constitutional In-

formation. I understood that the Corres-

ponding Society deputed five persons to at-

tend a meeting of the Constitutional Society ;

before I went to the committee, there was no-.
thing mentioned of it the first night as I un-
derstood—On the second night I understood .
they had appointed a committee of six per-
sons, and there were only five persons of the
Corresponding Society chose for the deputa-
tion, and then they chose another person to
add to them, to make up the number.

Were you present at any time, when the
deputation from your society reported, that
the Constitutional Society appointed six per-
sons, the Corresponding having appointed
five, they chose one more after, to make up
a six, then the twelve I suppose met ?—

Baxter, and Moore?—Yes. .

Were they the persons who were deputed
from your society, to correspond with the .
Constitutional Society ?—I was not present,
when the deputation was appointed.

Do you recollect any debate with respect
to yourself, and your age, at the time that
this business of delegates was considered?— |
Yes, I recollect it.

Who were the persons, do you recollect, ,
that took part in that debate?—Several per-
sons spoke, and most of them were stran-
gers to me at that time, and I did not know
lord they were, Mr. Thelwall was one that
spoke.

committee, when a business respecting a gen-

been struck, that was to be presented to the
jurymen that acquitted Mr. Eaton. *

What were the proceedings in the society
as far as came tu your knowledge, preparatory
to that meeting?—I do not know, I was only
Eppouned to the committee one night before
that, and that was the night when the debate
took place respecting myself, and I heard no-
thing at all but respecting that.

Were you present at the meeting at Chalk
Farm ?—I was there.

Where did you first go to—did you go to
Chalk Farm, or any other place first?—I went

he was there or not, for I was up in the long
room all the time. ol,

After you were admitted into the ground,
did any person take the chair?—Mr. Lovett
touk the chair soon after I was in the ground;
there were two ladies I was acquainted with;
we went up into the long room, and were
locked in, therefore I could not see so well.

Did you hear what was read, or said, so as
to be able to give any account of it, if not I

count of what was said.

committee of the London Corresponding So-
ciety at which the proceedings at Chalk

Nor in the society ?—No, because most of
the members heard it there. .

Do you know a place called Robins’s Coffee-
house, in Shire-lane?—Yes.

Is that a place at which any of the meet-
ings of the society were held?—Division, No.
29, met there. .

Did you use to attend the meetings of that
division occasionally?—I did, I was a member
of that division.

Be so good as to look at this paper, and tell
me whether you ever saw any of these sort of
papers distributed at Robins’s Coffee-house,
and were any of them delivered to you by
any of the persons you have named ?—I saw
some, but not so large as this, and ofa different
date.

Was it the same subject, did it contain the
same expressions? .

Mr. Erskine.—I must object to that ques-
tion.

Mr. Garrow.—I must insist upon the ques
tion.

Mr. Erskine—I will state my objection;
the witness is asked whether he saw -that
‘paper, or any paper similar to it?

Mr. Garrow. —That is not the question, nor |
any thing like it.

Mr. Erskine. —-State the question then.

Mr. Garrow.—The question I put was this;
whether had received a similar paper to
that at Robins’s Coffee-house? To which you
answer, not of that size?—Not at Robins’s

ffee- house.

Did_ you ever receive a paper of that sort
any where?—Of a different date. .

Of the same contents as that paper ?—Yes,
one ; but not so large.

Where did you receive that, and from
whom?—From a person of the name of
Baxter.

From that Baxter whom you have named,
as a member of the London Corresponding
Society?

Mr. Erskine.—The witness says, the paper
delivered by Baxter was not the same paper
as this; and that it was of a different date—
Does your lordship think the witness’s saying,
he believes the contents of this to be the
same, makes this paper evidence?

Mr. Garrow.—I submit that, if I ae ose
to read a passage from Locke, and I show
the witness an octavo edition of Locke, and
ask him whether he had read the passage in
a duodecimo edition of the same author, that
it is sufficient evidence, if he has, to let me in
to read it.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre. In order tocome
at that evidence, you would be obliged to lay
before the Court some evidence, that this
which you offered was an edition of Mr.
Locke’s work.—The question is, whether you
have gone far enough yet?

Mr. Erskine.—Exactly so.

Mr. Garrow.—I will ask a few more ques-
tions.—You say this paper is not of the same
site as the paper you received from Baxter?
—No

What is the date of this paper ?—Tuesday,
the first of April.

Did you, at any time, receive a paper from
Baxter, of the same contents as that, except
the date of the 30th of January, upon a paper
of a different size?

Mr. Erskine-—What did you do with that
paper?—It was destroyed before I was taken
into custody.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—That paper being
destroyed, the witness will give such account
of it as he can; he may either refresh his
memory by looking at this paper, or, if he
‘can venture to say, that this contains in it
the substance of the other, it may be received,
upon that account, as the best evidence;
either way, it comes to the same thing, with
regard to you, Mr. Erskine, and therefore, I
think it is not worth mooting.

Mr. Erskine.—The paper was fabricated by
the spies who support the prosecation.

Mr. Attorney General.—You shall not say
that, till you prove it.

Mr. Erskine.—I shall prove it.

Mr. détorney General.—Till you prove that,


you ought not to say it; itis a charge that
ought not to be made.

rd Chief Justice Eyre.—If there is an
point between you which should be heard,
the appeal, to be sure, must be made to the”
Court.

Mr. Garrow.---I wish to God it was; we
should save much time and trouble.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---A little indul-
gence, on both sides, would save much time?
and trouble. ’

Mr: Att General.—When a paper is

roduced, which your lordships hold to be
legal evidence to te read, it must not, and
shall nut be stated in this court, unless it is
proved, that the paper is fabricated by the
spies who carry on the prosecution.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I hope nothing
of that kind has been said, for it was an im-
proper thing to be said; and, if it dropt from
any body, it was an inadvertent thing.

—Yes.

Was it before you knew of Hardy’s being

blade, and nothing else.

‘They were to get that where they thought

roper.

While they were with. you, information
came that Mr. Hardy was apprehended---
Yes.

What sort of wood were the shafts to be
made of?---I do not know; fir was recom-

In consequence of that recommendation,
were any others procured ?---Yes, I had one.

Where did you get that?—I made that
myself. ‘

Was any observation made upon it?-—~Not
that I recollect. :

that Hardy was taken into custody ?---After
I was informed that Hardy was taken into
custody.


How happened that to be destroyed? by

afraid of its being found upon me.

Do you know of any other representation
by magic lantern, or other, that was used as
connected with this subject *~I had a mavic

Mr. Gosling.

% You mean Gosling one of the members ?-—
es.

Was there any connexion between that
entertaining apparatus, and the objects of

John Edwards cross-examined by Mr. Erskine.

How long before you were apprehended
were you a member of this Corresponding
Society ?-~-I_ became a member of the Corres-
ponding Society last July was a twelvemonth.

You said you made a pike for yourself; of
what trade are you?—A silversmith.

When did you-make that pike for yourself?
-~-I think it was in March. #

What year P---1794. .

How long had you been in the society at
the time you made that pike ?---From July
1793.

For what purpose did you make it?—I
had heard a person of the name of Yorke
that had just mentioned, one night in com-

any where I was, after one of the divisions
roke up at Robins’s coffee-house, that they
had pikes at Sheffield, and I made that.

But hearing that there were pikes at Shef-
field, why should that induce you to make a
pike for yourself; you must have had some
motive in your own mind for it?---I under-
stood some of the members were providing
themselves with arms, and I made that for
myself.

For what purpose ?---In case there should
be any illegal dispersion of the meetings.

Mx. Erskine.—Had you heard of any threats
having been made use of at Sheffield ?---No,
Lhad not; but it was just at the time the
Hessian troops were landed without the con-
sent of the parliament. - . :

You have the misfortune to be in the

custody of a messenger, but it does not follow
that you have been guilty of any offence ?---
That should be the case, or I should net have
been taken up by a warrant for treasonable
practices.

Had you any intention of making use of
that pike against the government of the
country ?--- Not against the government of
the country,

No such intention at all P-~None.

When you went to Mr. Hardy, what did you
go for?---I asked him if he was going to send
to Sheffield, and would inclose a few lines
for me to some person at Sheffield, that
could forge the blades for some pikes, that
several members of the society wished to
have them.

Did you speak to any members of the
society who wanted them P--- Not before.

Did you, after that, speak to some members
of the society who did want them P---Several
spoke to me about them. ‘

._ Did you understand them, that they wanted
them for the same reason as you wanted
them ?---I understood so.

Fromany thing that passed between you and
any of the members of the London Corres-
ponding Society, for whom you were disposed
through Mr. Hardy's assistance, to get direc-
tions to persons at Sheftield, had you any
Teason to believe that they wanted the pikes
for a rebellion against the government and
magistracy of the land ?---Not for a rebellion
against the government; not against any
legal power that might be sent to disperse

mm. :

- But if you were attacked without the
authority which the law confers upon magis-
trates, you thought you had a right to defend
yourselves ?-—Yes, just so.

* You thought very right; you appear to
have given a very fair account; I believe
that in consequence of that you made a pro-
position in one of the divisions where sixteen
olen were present ?---That was long before

had the direction from Mr. Hardy,

What was the reason of your making the

ea act at that time?---Because there
been great opposition shown to the
meetings before that time.

Had any insults been offered to any of the
members ?—There was; ata division I was
present at in Rotherhithe, two of the police
offers came in, they wanted to know what
they wanted; they said they came to see if
there were any men fit for his majesty’s
service.

Were you at that time doing any thing, er
were the people who were there, doing any
thing that your own consciences suggested to
you to be wrong?

Mr. Attorney General.-Is that a question
to be asked ?

Mr. Erekine-I say it is, subject to his
lordship’s opinion.

Mr. Attorney General.—Be 80 good to say
why?

q


Mr. Erskine.+-I should be very glad to
hear why it is not.

Mr. Attorney General_—They may do acts
their own consciences may think right ; but
that does not make them le:

Mr. Erskine—That is the reason I shall
put the question that way; a man may know
what his conscience is, though he may not
know what the law is.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Being upon a
cross-examination, I think he may be asked
whether he at the time apprehended that the
thing which he was doing was lawful or
unlawful—whether it was so, or not, will not
depend upon his apprehension, but it may go
to the general evidence he gives—it may
operate one way or other—if he has done an
illegal thing, but innocently, if he is brought
as a witness, he may be asked to that ; what
the effect of it will be, I do not know.

Edwards.—At the very time that the people
came in to disperse us, we were reading the
address from Mr. Pitt aud the duke of Rich
mond at the Thatched-house tavern.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Was it more or
less legal upon that account?

Mr. Erskine.—-Certainly not.

Mr. Attorney General.---So far, that if the
conscience of the witness is to decide it, I
poy help thinking it may be more or less

Mr. Erskine—I wish it to be understood I
am no advocate for the conscience of the
duke of Richmond nor Mr. Pitt.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—~It is certainly
truco; but this is rather too grave an occasion
for such an observation.

Mr. Attorney General,---It is not a proper
occasion for this frippery.

Mr. Erskine—I say that is not a proper
expression. . :
Mr. Attorney General.—I will repeat it.

Mr. Erskine,---You will not repeat it any
where else.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Tne gentlemen
I hope will recollect they are upon a
solemn trial.

Mr. Erskine.---I think it is really hard
upon mé upon this solemn trial, that I should
be eternally assailed by these Eeatlemen,
when I have the arduous task of extracting
the truth from these witnesses.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—If any persoa
were dispose| (which I 5ay Do one is) to

‘ive you any interruption, it would be my
uty to preserve order, and take care you
should be permitted to go on in your business
without interruption ; but it is impossible the
cause can go on, unless the gentlemen at the
bar will a little understand one another, and
noutual forbearance, assist one another ;
you are a little too apt to break out, and I
think there Has been a little inclination
sometimes to observe more upon that thea
the ocdasion ealls for.

Mr. Attorney General—As far as came

from me, I am sorry fer it. .

Mr. Erskine.—I will repeat the question,
if I have your lordship’s liberty to put it, the
objection being over-ruled.-—At the time you
were opposed in this manner, were you doing
any bara which in your apprehension, or
your mind, was wrong ?---I was not.

From any thing that you saw or heard from
those persons with whom you associated, did
you collect that they intended to make a
different use of the pikes than that for which
you had made your own ?—I did not.

You said you made a proposition which
was negatived by the committee, or whoever
it was, when sixteen persons were present;
what was the proposition you made ?-—-It was
about forming another society upon the same
Principle as that at Lambeth, but no person
would second it.

When you made that proposition to have a
souely upon the same footing as that at
Lambeth, what did you conceive that sociely
to be?—It bore the name of the Loyal Lam-

Association, that was the same as that I
Meant to form in case there should be any
illegal dispersion of the meetings.

_If you had understood that Lambeth Asso-
ciation to have been of persons disposed to
oppose the magistracy of the country, should
Lo have made that proposition ?—I should
no
.. And yet, though you made that proposition,
it was not assented to?—No.

Do you remember the prisoner saying any
thing about that ?—No; I do not remember
his saying any thing of it.

. Have you seen him at any of those meet-
ings ?—Yes, at my division several times.

How did he deport himself?—In a very
quiet manner; I never heard him speak in
any of the divisions, not once.

_Did he appear to be a man of a turbulent
disposition ?—No, quite a different man.

) you recollect any expressions he has
used in any of the meetings that led you to
think him a quiet, well-meaning man ?—I
always understood he was so; I never heard

make use of an improper expression since
I was in the society.

Did you ever hear Mr. Hardy make any
eon for arms or pikes?——Never. ©

. ere you ever present when any proposi-
tion of that sort was made, when he assented
toit, or encouraged it ?—I never was present
and heard any thing of the kind mentioned,
but what was mentioned by me in the shop,
and no person was present but Mr. Hardy and
myself,

Did any thing more pass between Mr.
Hardy an you than what you have mentioned
here?—No more.

Did ‘ia tell Mr. Hardy that you had made
& pike?—I did.

Did you tell him for what purpose you had
made it?—I did not tell him for what pur-

. He knew you were a member of the so-
Clety ?—Yes.


This bill that has been talked of, upon what
occasion did Baxter give it you?—He gave it
to two or three persons ; I asked him to give
me one.

Why did you ask to have a thing of that
sort, so perfectly indecent, absurd, and ridi-
culous?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—If you had
added infamous, it would have been quite
proper—it should not be mentioned without
some term that strongly expresses detesta-
tion—and ridiculous is not enough; I am
sure you think so.

Mr. Erskine.—I certainly do think so—
Give me leave to ask, how you came to ask
for a bill of that description ?—I saw it ata
distance, and could not read it; I wished to
satisty my curiosity, and asked Baxter to give
me one.

His lordship having given a proper epithet
to this bill, as a detestable thing, did you ever
hear any thing pass from any member of the
Society, and more especially from the prisoner,
which leads you to conclude that he ‘would
approve of a thing of that nature ?—No.

Did you ever hear any expression pass in
the course of their meetings that would lead
you to believe they would think otherwise of
the bill than his lordship and I have now ex-
pressed our sentiments upon it?—I heard
another person on the same night say it was
an infamous thing, and too bad to be counte-
nanced ; it was only given to two or three,

Have you any reason to believe the pri-
soner was acquainted with, connected with, or
had seen that bill ?—I do not believe he had
ever seen it; I have no reason to know that
he had ever seen it.

From what you had an opportunity of ob-
serving of the prisoner at the bar, do you
lieve he would have encouraged a bill of that
description?—I do not believe any such
thing.

John Edwards re-examined by: Mr. Garrow.

With respect to this infamous bill, which
was considered so by those who received it;
you received it in a division meeting ?--Not
at a division meeting.

You reecived it from a member of the divi-
sion ?—Not at that division.

From a member of the Corresponding So-
ciety, Baxter ?—It was,

Three months before the date mentioned in
it, the 30th of January ?—Near three months «

Now with respect to its absurdity and folly,
having seen two or three delivered to different
persons, you asked for one ?—I did.

‘That was not precisely the same bill that
has been delivered to-day ?—Not the same ;
not so large.

This is a subsequent one, larger, and of
another date ?—It is. .

That purporting to be an entertainment on
the 30th of January—this purporting to be on
the first of April succeeding ?—It is.

You did not form any pike for yourself,

2Y

until after you had heard from Mr. Yorke,
that the society at Sheffield were preparing
pikes for themselves?—I heard Mr. Yorke
mention one night at the division, that the
people at Sheffield had got pikes.

Was it Mr. Yorke’s intimation of what had
passed at Sheffield, that led you to apply to
‘Mr. Hardy for a direction to procure pike
blades from that town?—No, I went of my
own accord.

What induced you to go to Mr. Hardy for

a direction toa person at Sheffield, who would
forge the blades for some pikes?— Because I
understood Mr. Hardy knew who were the
Persons, or the secretary of the society at
Sheffield would know who were the persons
to whom I could send.
. If I understand you right, the particular
occasion upon which these pikes were to be
made, was upon the landing of Hessian troops
‘without the consent of parliament?—Not
upon that occasion, I said I made it just at the
time that the Hessian troops were landed
without consent of parliament.

Then your making pikes had not any rela-
tion, I take for granted, to the landing of the
Hessian troops without consent of parlia-
ment; I mistook you when I took it so?—
Not in consequence of their being landed.

Nor at all connected with that?—No; I
only said I made it at that time.

Did you know that the Sheffield Society,
which was in correspondence with your so.
ciety, had published a resolution, “ that the
landing of Hessian troops in this country (a
ferocious and unprincipled horde of butchers)
without consent of parliament, has a suspi-
cious and alarming appearance; is contrary
to the spirit of our constitution, and deserving
of the marked indignation of every English-
man; that it is high time to be upon our
guard, since these armed monsters may in a
moment be let loose upon us” 2—I do not re-
collect that,

"Do you venture to say that you never heard
of that at that time from Mr. Yorke?—Not at
that time.

How soon did you hear of that resolution
from the Sheftield Society ?—Not for some
time after. J

Upon your oath, was your pike completed
before you heard of it in your division meet-
ings ?—No, it was not.

Upon your oath will you venture to say you
began to make it before that communication
froin Sheffield was made to your society?—
No ; I had not begun it.

Then T believe [ was right in what I took
down, that your making that pike was because
Hessian troops were landed withou® the con-
sent of parliament?—I did not make it on
that account, but I made it just at the time.

Did you make it soon after Yorke had
communicated that the Sheffield Society had
come to spirited resolutions upon landing
those troops?--I never heard him say any
thing upon that subject.


Where did you hear it ?—I learnt it from a
book that I purchased at Eaton’s shop.

At Eaton’s shop in Newgate-street, the
Cock and Swine >—Yes.

Was Eaton a member of one of your s0-
cieties? He was. oo,

This was to prevent any illegal dispersion
of your society ?—It was. .

ow long had your society met in general
meetings and in secret committees without
the use of pikes, or the fabrication of any,
antecedent to the resolutions at Sheffield as
to landing Hessian troops?—I suppose for
two years. .

Had you met with any interruption what-
ever in your meetings, except that which you
have named of two police ofhcers, coming into
the public-house, and stating that they wanted
to see if there were any men fit to serve his
majesty ?—A division in Bunbill-row was
often interrupted by the police ofticers.

Had you met with any interruption in your
general meetings, committees, or secret cour
mittees, except from peace officers ?-—-No.

any arms for him?—Yes. :

the time.

Were you a member of the London Cor

of being a member of the London Corres-
ponding Society, was by seeing an advertise-
Ment in the Daily Advertiser from the
London Corresponding Aontety.

About what time ?—In the last year ; about
the middle of the year.

You became a member, in what manner?—
I saw an atlvertisement in the Daily Adver-
tiser of a general meeting to be held in the

to be had of Thomas Hardy, secretary to the
Corresponding Society, No. 9, Piccadilly. I
went to him; he informed me that it was not
customary to give tickets to any but such 2s
were members of the society, which I told
him I was not; we had some further conver-
sation.

What was that farther conversation ?—It
was something concerning a reform in parlia-
ment; I cannot relate the conversation.

Do you mean to say the subject of the con-
‘versation you have described, was to state
what the object of the society was ?—It was
for a reform in portaments

Did Hardy tell you so?—Yes; he gave me
one of the London Corresponding Society’s
addresses which they had published. F gave
him an order for a pair of shoes; the next
time I went to his house I had the shoes—I
told him I was in the line of selling guns, if
he knew any person that wanted such things,
I should be obliged to him if he would re-
commend me; he told me_he did not know
any person, if he heard of any person he
would let me know; the next time I went to
his house, he told me to bring a gun and the
price, which I did.

How long was that after you had Gret seen
him ?—About a fortnight or three weeks—I
‘took. a gun to him, which he sold.

On your account or bis?—On my account.
I.gave him an order fora pair of buots, which
he made me, and told me to bring two or
three moré guns, which he sold likewise, and
one ‘gun was in his house, which was never
sold, which I never was paid for.

‘What night in the week was it that you
used to meet ?---I believe it was on a Thurs-
day night. . :

Who introduced you at first to the London
Corresponding Society ?---I told Mr. Hardy
that I should be glad to become a member of
the London Corresponding Scciety, but did
not know any person to introduce me; he
named several persons, but I did not know
either of them ; he said he would propose me;
it was upon his proposition that I became a
member of the London Corresponding Society.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---How soon after

member ?---It might be a fortnight or three

purpose of eteppi th in case of fire, tu-
otis, cananctone and riots, but they were
not to iM beyond the parish of St. Mary’s
Lambeth. I asked you, before, whether any
of those members, except Franklow that
you knew, were inhabitants of the parish of
al a said not ?—Not to my know-

e, : i
id you know any of them ?—I knew that
some of them were not.

How came § e's house, in Turnstile,
Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields, to be a ae fixed upon
for exercising the members of the Loyal Lam-
beth Association, who were not to go beyond
the bounds of their own parish ?—F can tell
no otherwise, only, that they could not
any place else. It was thought proper, ey
Franklow, and some others, that as they
could not get members fast enough, that the
association should be divided into ten divi-
sions ; one division to be up at Spence’e—ano-
ther at John Shelmerdine’s~another in West-
tainster, at Williamson’s; where the others
were to be I do not know.

Had you, at the time that you were supply-
ing arms to this society, any conversations
with them upon the subject of parliamentary
reform: or did you hear any conversation
among them respecting that ?—Yes ; there was
conversation of that kind passed between

them, more times than once, at the times of | not.

their meetings.

What was the subject of those conversa-
tions, or did those conversations respect at al!
the end of their association P-—I cannot tell; I
never minuted any thing down.

Can you tell the substance of any conversa+
tian they had upon the subject of parliemen-
tary reform?—I can go no further than this,
that I could coltect so far es this, that if they
could not get a reform of parliamert without
it, they would endeavour to have got it by the
force of arms. ; om


I ask you from the conversation of the
members of that association that met——

Mr. Gibbs.—I object to this—I understand
the Court has determined that any thing that
any member of the Corresponding Society
says, is evidence against Mr. Hardy: but I do
bot apprehend that the Ceurt has determined
that every thing said by the members of the
Lambeth Association, whom the witness does
not know to be members of the Correspond-
ing Society is evidence; consequently the
question put, of what this man has heard from
any member of the Lambeth Association, um

Mr. Bower.—I understood you, that Hardy
gave you the address of Franklow !—Yes; he
gave me his card.

Ta consequence of which you went +
Franklow’s, and there met this society ?—Yes;

Mr. Bower.—I conceive when I prove that
a number of persons assemble together, under
the directions of the prisoner, that I can give
evidence of their conversation. ~ :

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—The moment you
have proved one of the terms of your proposi-
tion you are right ; at the mement it is
that this association of Franklow’s was un-
der the eckenes gel apnea undoubtedty
ever’ ing t wi evidence against
the: oa . meh I do not observe that the
evidence goes farther than this—~in the course
of trade Williams buying shoes and boots of
Hardy, Hardy recommends him to Franklow,
in'the way of his business, and there is no:
thing that I can discover, at present, to coo-
nect Franklow’s transaction, with r to
this association, with Hardy, except so far as
the: members of it, can be traced to be mem-
bers of the London Corresponding Society :
you have examined with a view to that,and it
appeared to me that that examination rather
failed, for he did not undertake to know that
any of those people were members of that
society. wt

Mr. Bower.—I will see if I can get the facts

| a hittle more distinctly—was Franklow a meow

ber of the London Corresponding Society P—~
He was. :
Did you know Shelmerdine ?-—~Yes.
- Was he a member?—He was.
De you know John Williamson?—Yes; but
T cannot say whether he was a member or

Do you know James Davison?—I never ©
saw him but once,

Do you know whether he was a member
of the Corresponding Society? —I cannot
take upon me to say.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Franklow was a
member of the London Corresponding Society
—this association undoubtedly was formed by
him---it is his creature absolutely ; and there-
fore that is the ground on which the transac-
tion of that association must be fet in.

- Mr, Solicitor-General.—lt has already been


proved that at the dinner on the 20th of Ja-
nuary, Franklow appeared in the regimentals
ef this association.

Mr. Gibbs.—He did so: but I do not appre-
hend that if any gentleman who wears a parti-
cular uniform had appeared up stairs at dinner
with your lordships to-day, that your lordships
would be affected by any thing which a mem-
ber of the society, to which that gentleman
belonged had said. I might put the case of
some gentlemen who did dine with your lord-
ships, who are engaged in societies that wear
uniforms: suppose one of those gentlemen
had happened to dine with your lordships up
stairs in that uniform, by the argument the
solicitor-general uses, because he appeared in
his uniform, at dinner with your lordships,
therefore, what any one said who belonged to
the society, distinguished by that uniform
would be evidence against all those who h
dined with that gentleman. It seems to me
that is an argument which cannot stand for a
moment

Another way in which it has been put by
my learned friend, Mr. Bower, is thise—That
because Mr. Franklow being a member of the
London ‘Corresponding Society, presided at
another society, fur a purpose that is not con-
nected with the London Corresponding Society
---therefore, first his declarations are evidence
against Hardy, because he is one of those

sands of whom the London Correspond-
ing Society consists; and next, if he consti-
tutes another society consisting of ten thou-
sand men, every thing, that every one of
those ten thousand men, who are constituted
by one man that belongs to the two or three
thousand of which the London Corresponding
Society consists, is to be evidence against
Mr. Hardy—-It does not seem to me that
there is any principle of law upon which any
of those men who happened to belong to a
society, instituted by Franklow, he happening
to be a member of the society of which Hardy
was a member, that the declarations of any
one of those men so sub-connected with the so-
ciety, no, not even upon oath, can be evidence
against Hardy, to prove either that he has com-
passed the king’s death, or done any of the
acts stated in this indictment, or that those
acts were. pointed to that design sgainet the
king’s life. Perhaps, I am less distinct in
arguing the case before your lordship, be-
cause, I confess, I do not feel any principle
upon which this can be contended to be evi-
dence.

Mr. Bower.---I will prove that none were
to be admitted into Franklow’s Association
but members of the London Corresponding
Society.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Whether the
principle will apply to the particular fact is
another thing ; butit has been so often stated,
that I am surprised we have not had the good
fortune to make ourselves understood by the
bar, because we have stated from the begin-
ning of this trial, that there was a species of


evidence, which was admissible in this case,
which had no immediate relation to the pri-
soner; and that there was another species
of evidence which had immediate relation to
the prisoner—that inasmuch as the prisuner
is charged with being involved in a conspiracy
and some evidence being given of his hav-
ing been so involved, that all the transactions
of that conspiracy, to which he is not imme-
diately a party, he will be bound by, if, upon
the whole, he has consented to that geteral
‘conspiracy; and that, therefore, all the trans-
actions of a plot are always given in evidence,
without regard to the question, whether the
prisoner is proved to be concerned in those
particular transactions—always with this re-
serve, that there must be evidence enough
against the prisoner to prove him so involved
in the plot, as to become seapansibie for all
the parts of it—thatseems sufficiently distinct.

But there may be a doubt whether this par-
ticular case falls withio the principle. ‘Fhe
first question is—whether there is any evi-
dence here of Franklow’s being a member of
the London Corresponding Society; if the
only proof of that is, that he dined in an un
form at their annual dinner, I should have
great difficulty about that, because, I under
stand, that they were in the habit of receiving
visitors as well as entertaining their own
members—that being so, a man might be
there without being a member of the London
Corresponding Society.

Supposing it once proved distinctly that he
was a member of the London Corresponding
Society, then the question will be, was hea
member of the Corresponding Society, who is
charged with having a great share in the
whole of this transaction—is found to be as-
sociating persons together under a pretence
not true in fact, of their being inhabitants of
Lambeth, and associating forthe defence of the
inhabitants of Lambeth; that they are fur-
nished with arms, are learning the manual
exercise, and are connected with the society,
either by Franklow’s being, or being them-
selves members of the Corresponding Society.
I cannot undertake to say, that that will not
connect with the general history of this trans-
action; and, therefore, there may be room
upon that ground to admit the evidence ; but
first of all, how is the fact with regard to
Franklow being a member?

Mr. Gibbs.—I could understand how Frank-
low’s declarations were evidence, but the
point that puzzled me was, I could not under-
stand how the declarations of those men who
were only concerned with Franklow in his as-
sociation, could be evidence, because it seems
to me upon the same principle that the decla-
rations of people sub-employed by them, and
of others sub-employed by them, and so oa,
would be evidence.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Unless the
be put exactly in the condition of F;
your objection is right.

Mr. Attorney General.—Was Franklow a

can
low,

member of the Corresponding Society ?—--He
was.

Mr. Bower.-~W hether, previous to your ad-
mission into that society, you had any conver-
sation with the prisoner about the London
Corresponding Society, about providing arms
for the Lambeth Association ?--I cannot re-
collect.

Were you admitted a member of the Lon-
don Corresponding Society, before you were
employed by the Lambeth Association?---

es. :

How happened you to be admitted a mem-
of the Land Corresponding Society?.~-Mr.
Hardy told me to meet a young man who
would go with me to the division, and I should
be admitted, and I was by that means ad-
mitted. ’

Before you were admitted to the Lambeth
Association, were you asked at all, whether
you were a member of the London Corres-
ponding Society ?--I do not recollect that I

was.

Did Franklow know that you were?---I
have no reason to think he did not; I believe
he did.

Hardy did know it?-~Yes.

From the conversation of the members there
associated. ——

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—-Enquire what
the conversation was, because whether he
rightly collects the effect of it or not, cannot
be known with certainty.

Mr. Bower.—Tell us the substance of any
conversation you have heard amongst the
members of this society respecting the pur-
poses of this association for a arliauentary
reform ?

Mr. Gibbs.-—It seems to me that it is not
open to Mr. Bower to fix the prisoner with
what the witness may fancy he has collected
froma conversations that he has heard at this so-
ciety, without mentioning who.those persons
were from whom he heard it: for how am I
to contradict it?

Mr. Bower.---If you ever heard any conver-
sations of the kind, do you recollect any of
the members of the society who were present?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---You said you
understood from conversation amongst them,
what they intended to du. Now what were
those conversations, and from whom did you
hear those conversations?—I really cannot
name the ons; I make no doubt but
what Mr. Nodder and Mr. Sanderson them-
selves might be present, they were members
of the same association.

Mr. Bower.-—Did you hear any thing from
Franklow about a parliamentary reform ?---I
cannot say I recollect any thing that he said
particularly ; he was present when such con-
versation passed.

Frederic Polydore Nodder sworns--Examined
by Mr. Bower.

Were you a member of the Loyal Lambeth
Association ?---No,
t


Were you ever present with them ?—No.

Were you ever at Spence’s in Turnstile ?--~
I was, :

Were you ever there when any of the Loyat
Lambeth Association were there ?--I cannot
tell, for I do not know any thing of any per-
sons of that description.

George Sanderson sworn.---Examined by Mr.
er.

Were yo ever present at any meeting of
the Loyal Lambeth Association?---None of
that description as I know of.

Mr. Bower to Williams.---Did you ever hear
any conversation in the presence of Franklow,
from-the persons who were present there at
that association?—Yes; I have said so al-
ready. .

You have, in the presence of Franklow,
though you do not know the persons ?—Yes.

Mr. Bower.-—I submit that it is sufficient to
let in the evidence.

Mr. Justice Grose.—But let us hear the
conversation, Mr. Bower, not what he col-
lected. j

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—-All that can
affect Franklow by the general evidence, must
be admissible.

Mr. Erskine.---The Court has ruled fre-
quently in the course of the trial—and it
would be indecent in us to argue it again,
that any thing said or done by any member of
the London Corresponding Society, or any
members of any other society with which that
society is implicated, will be evidence to prove
the first branch of the conspiracy, and that
they must go on to build upon that evidence
that which is necessary afterwards to affect
the prisoner. Therefore I submit to your
lordships what I take to be the distinction
here--- Mr. Bower was going on to prove that
all the members of the Lambeth Association
were members of the Corresponding Society,
which would put an end to our objection; or
supposing they were not all members, if
the witness had said that what was done came
from a member of the Corresponding Society,
then I apprehend it will be evidence also;
but your lordship has truly said, that Mr,
Hardy does not seem to be more connected
with Williams, the serjeant major of this
particular body, than merely in the course of
trade he asked him if he knew any body that
wanted guns, he said he did not; this man
made shoes for him; in the course of a fort.
night or three weeksafter herecommended him
to Franklow, but non constat that at the time
he recommended him to Franklow, he knew

.

the articles of his association, he only knew.-

Franklow in his character of a member of the
London Corresponding Society; therefore [
conceive it would be going beyond the .rule
your lordship has estal lished, for a. man to
state what he heard in the presence of Frank-
low, who might be attending to somethin

else,or who might not approve of what was said,

and which might have nothing to do with his


institution ; it would be too much fo affect the
prisoner, particalarly at so late a period of the
cause (though I do not mean to say that
would make any specific difference) with a
declaration so very inconsistent with what
your lordship has already heard upon this
subject; it therefore seems to me an object
of greater suspicion, and more our duty to
guard against. The witness has said he can-
not specify who the person was, and if they
were not all members of the London Corres-
ponding Society, nun constat, that the man
was a member of the London Corresponding

Society.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre——-Nothing turns
upon the question whether Hardy did or not
recommend Wiliiams to Franklow, the ground
of its admissibility is simply that Franklow
was a member of the London Corresponding
Society—-then as a ground of the general con-
Spiracy, it is offered to prove that Franklow
has formed an association of armed men, to
which, association they will impute a design
connected with this alleged conspiracy ; what-
ever, therefore, will fix Franklow with that,
has been considered as proper evidence to
shat eral charge; and the only question,
therefore is, whether laying, for a moment, the
imself at the bar---whether if he makes an
association of persons of this description, and
if there are convetsations passing in his pre-
sence, from: whence a bad design can be im-
puted to this association, whether that is not
admissible evidence as against him? what the
effect of the evidence will be, it is truly ob-
seryed, will depend upon a thousand circum-
stances; whether he was attending, whether
if he was attending, he approved or disap-
proved of it? all which may avoid the effect
ef the evidence; still it seems to me that as
against Franklow, and to fix upon him the
having been. guilty of forming this association
fora purpose, the transactions that pass
in hie hearing are clearly evidence.

Mr. Bower to Williams.~-You told me Mr.
Sanderson and Mr. Nodder were present at
a conversation that I should have asked you
to, if I had been admitted; were they present
at Spence’s, Franklow’s, or Shelmerdine’s ?-—-
I basa only seen them at Shelmerdine’s aad

Frederic Polydore Nodder called in again.—.

Examined by Mr. Bower.

You are a member of the London Corres-
ponding society ?---I am.

Were you present at either Spence’s or
Shelmerdine’s, and at which, at the time the
last witness, bales ns there, and when
persons were assembled for the purpose of be-

drilled?—-To my knowledge I Cette saw
Williams but at Spence’s.

You have been with Williams at Spence's,
when the persons were assembled that he was
lag and teaching the manual exercise ?—I

soner eut of the case, supposing Franklow .


When you were there, did you from any
persons there, hear any conversation

Lord Chiet Justice Eyre.—Did you say you
were a member of the London Corresponding
Society ?— Yes, 1am a member of the 13th
division ; here is my ticket [Predacing it}.

Mr. Bower.—Do you know whether’ the
persons who were there, were members of the
London Corresponding Society or not ?—I
cannot say whether all were; some of them
were.

[The Ticket read.]}

“No. 35, London Corresponding Society,
united fora Reform of Parliamentary Represen-
tation—Unite, persevere, and be free—Divi-
sion No. 18.” On the back— “ Frederick
Nodder, paid to Midsummer tenpence, Samuel
Cooper, 1794.”

Mr. Bower.—I cannot carry this farther,
and therefore I must leave it to the sense of
the Court.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I understand
the Court to have decided that you may in-
quire into conversations in the presence of

‘ranklow.

Mr. Erskine—To what was said, but not
what he collected.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Not what he
collected.

Mr. Bower to Williams.—Tell me any
conversation you recollect when Franklow was
present respecting the London Corresponding
Society ?—1 cannot recollect the conversa-
tions.

Can you recollect any part of them; how
did you collect it?—By being with them at
various times, and hearing different talk ;
there were some among them which I did not
take any notice of, or give myself any concern
about.

When they met at all, was the subject of
parliamentary reform intreduced at all as 2
topic of conversation ?—No, only some would
be talking one to the other.

You meaui it was not pores conversation,
not as a debate, ur any thing of that kind?—
No.

But they were talking to each other?—

es,

Were they talking so that Franklow beard
them ?—Private persons might talk about it.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—We ought to be
always very correct when collecting what peo-
ple said. I think you had better not press it.

Mr. Bower.—Y ou heard from Franklow thet
they were to consist of sixty ?—Yes.

Did you hear from Franklow whether they
were to have any more, or that was to be the
utmost quantity they were to have?—That
was to be the number.

Had you any directions from Franklow or
Hardy upon the subject of arms, or of any
other kind ?—I was one night in Mr. Hardy's
shop, and there was a person there asked me
tel long I thought Is be to get a thuu-
sand.

Was Mr. Hardy present ?—He was present;
it was a stranger; he asked how long I
thought I should be getting a thousand guns ;
I told him I could not think of getting so
many in the situation that I was in.

What said Hardy to it?—I do not know
that he made any reply.

Was any thing more said ?—They said they
might get a thousand from Sheftield; I said
such a thing might be, but I could not under-
take any thing of the kind; there as far as I
recollect, the conversation ended.

George Sanderson examined by Mr. Law.

Where do you live ?—In Butcher-row Tem-

le- bar.

You keep a public-house there, the Bunch
of Grapes?—Yes.

Have you ever been at Spence’s with Nod-
der ?—Yes.

How long ago is it since you first went to
Shelmerdine’s if ever you were there ?—I must
refer to the notes I have, the memorandum I
made. [{lefers to his memorandum.) It
was the znd of April.

What was the occasion of your going there?
—It was to decide a bet.

Did you sce any fire-arms there?—I did.

Whom did they belong to ?—They belonged
to the armed society.

Where were they?—At Shelmerdine’s in
the borough.

What is Shelmerdine?—A hatter.

On what day was this?—The second of
April in the evening.

Do you know of how many persons this
armed society consisted?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre —How many stand
of arms did you find there?—I did not take
particular notice, there might be seven or
eight stand of arms there.

Of how many persons did this armed so-
ciety consist?—I suppose of twenty-four or
twenty-five members.

Whether all the persons of the association
were members of the London Corresponding
Society?—I suppose they were, because they
objected to my being of the armed associa-
tion because I was not a member of the Lon-
don Corresponding Society. I was made a
member of the armed society upon a promise
that I would become a member of the London
Corresponding Society.

Did you afterwards become so?—I did.

How many persons have you scen at any
one time together at this armed society ?—I
think when I first met them at Shelmerdine’s
there might be twenty-four or twenty-five:
they did not all meet at Shelmerdine’s; we
adjourned to another place; it was supposed
to be dangerous to meet at Shelmerdine’s; the
adjournment had been agreed upon before I
came there; the greater part of the arms had
been removed.

Who had you to teach yeu the military
exercise there ?—We did not exercise there.

Or at the place to which you adjourned ?—



We did not exercise there, we only adjourned
there for the purpose of fixing upon a prope
place to exercise in.

What was the house to which they did ad-
journ ?—The house was in Worcester-street.

Was the name of the person Day ?—The
same—we went up stairs, they mentioned
then that the private committee of the armed
society had fixed upon another place for exer-
cising.

Where did that private committee sit ?—~
They sat with the rest.

At Day’s ?—Yes.

What were those places where you were to
assemble ?—One was at Spence’s, the other
was in Westminster, just by ‘othil-fields
Bridewell, at a blacksmith’s shed.

Did you assemble with others at any time
at either of those places?—Yes, I pretty con-
stantly attended them; I went to Spence’s
first; we met once or twice a weck.

For what number of weeks did you meet?
—I called several times when there were none
there; it was the 14th of November, I think,
I first of all went ;—no ; it was on the 11th of
April, the first time I went to Spence’s to ex-
etcise; I continued to ga occasionally to
Spence’s till May the 1st.

From the 11th of April, till May, you con-
tinued to go to Spence’s, and this shed in
Westminster, for the purposes of exercising?
—I did. :

Who was the person that generally taught
you?— Formerly Williams; and Orr, from
the 11th of April till May; on the first of
May I took away my gun. '

What was the greatest number of persons
you met, at either of those places, during the
period you have mentioned f—I do not thmk
we ever met above six.

And you were there taught the military ex-
ercise ?—Yes.

What was Orr?—I believe a taylor. I have
heard 90.

Had he served abroad ?—He mentioned fre-
quently in conversation, that he had served
against the allied armies.

Was he a member ?—He was a member of
the Corresponding Society; he had served in
the French army, from his own account.

You were not at first admitted, but you be-
came afterwards a member of the Corres-
ponding Society ?—I did.

What was the reason that you did not ig
afterwards to exercise at Shelmerdine’s?—He
was a hatter, and frequently changed his
men; and some of them, they observed, might
not be staunch to the cause, and therefore it
might be hazardous.

rd Chief Justice Eyre.—Hazardous to
the cause; to what cause?—IfI might judge
from the conversation, it was to obtain a par-
liamentary reform, at the point of the
bayonet.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—When you say,
the cause, do you mean the cause they were
engaged in?—Yes.

22

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—You were in au
association, and had articles of an association?
—I never saw them. :

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Were not the
articles acted upon?—Part of them were;
that we were to pay so much upon admission;
one half of which was to buy arms, the other
to defray the incidental expenses of the society.

Mr: Law.—Were you a member of the 13th

division ?—I was admitted » member the |

same night Mr. Nodder was, and received a
similar ticket.

Did that meet at Robins’s Coffee-house, in
Shire-lane?—Yes.

Do you remember, upon the 3rd of May,
any member giving an account of the time
when Mr. Pitt would probably be at the
House of Commons ?—Yes, I perfectly well
recollect the circumstance; it was in the
month of May; I do not recollect the night.

What was the conversation that passed in
the presence of those members, respecting the
circumstance I bave mentioned ?—One of the
members got up, and said, citizens——.

Mr. Erskine.—Who was the member ?—I
do not know. :

Mr. Erskine.—I submit it is necessary it
should appear, that he was a member of the
Corresponding Society.

Mr, Law.—Was it a member of the divi-
sion ?—Yes, at this meeting none were ad-
admitted but members.

What did this member say ?—Citizens, Mr.
Pitt will go over—I forget which of the
bridges, but he mentioned one of the bridges,
at twelve o’clock at night.

Did he accompany that with any observa-
tion?—None ; there was a general clap upon
the table, and some said it was very improper
to make any comments upon it.

Was any thing farther said, al what
bridge ?--- They mentioned the particular
bridge, and on what occasion-he would be de-
tained tilltwelve o'clock at night; 1 think it
was Putney bridge, but do not recollect the
bridge to a certainty.

Was any piece of good news, or any thing
they called good news, announced, at that
time, by one of the members?—-Yes; there
was some good news announced that very
night, as they termed it.

Vhat was it?---A defeat of part of the Bri-
tish army; I do not recollect what.

Was that called good news ?—It was gene-
tally so understood by the society. :
es that, so described, so announced ?-—

es.

Do you recollect any thing being .men-
tioned, with respect to any of the king’s mes-
senvers?---I do.

What was that?--That he had the pleasure
to inform the socicty, that he heard one of
the king’s messengers had been killed in the
couniry.

_ Do you remenr a member of that so-
elety of the naine cf Tgsuis?---L remember
the name of ciuzcu Lilgginsy Lut I do not re-
collect his person,

N


Do you remember any observation that a
member made, respecting any of his rela-
tions ?--I do recollect some observations, but
cannot recollect the exact words ; but I think
he said, if it had been his own father, or his
own son, he should be glad, if he met with
the same fate.

Had who been?-—The messenger.

Was that man a near relation of any of
the king’s messengers ?—-I do not know.

Was that said by Higgins ?—I do not know;
L do not know Higgins personally.

Was any thing mentioned, by way of cau-
tion, to the members, for fear of spies?—It
was frequently hinted to the members to be
cautious, for fear of spies; to be careful what
they said; for, in all divisions of the society,
spies from the treasury would creep in.

Do you remember any proposition for sub-
dividing the meetings into a less number ?—
Yes; it was a proposal, that, as they might be
prevented meeting in public houses, on ac-
count that their licences might be taken away,
that they should be divided into tithings,
that they might meet at the House of every
tenth man.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Was that your
armed society? No; the London Corres-
foballig Socie

Mr. Law.—Was the proposition acceded to?
—It was deferred for further consideration.

Was there any mention of any one of the
committee being a spy?—Not in particular
that I recollect; there was some one alluded
to, but I did not understand who it was.

Was any thing said what should be done, if
any spy was discovered among you?—One
member observed, he should not regard blow-
ing any spy’s brains out, if he discovered him.

You had a misket?—Yes.

From whom ?—From Williams.

That musket you bave now ?—No, I have
not.

George Sanderson cross-examined by Mr.
Erskine.

Soa member said, he would not care for
blowing any spy's brains out?—Yes.

Were not you alittle afraid when you heard
that ?—I was.,

! you were a spy, were you?—I was,

What was that paper you had in your hand,
a little while ago?—Merely a memorandum
of dates.

lam glad you have it; we will go to work
with dates; I like a paper of dates; you will
be bound by it?—I will be bound by it, upor
my oath, as near as a man can be bound toa
paper of dates.

On what night was it, and at what place,
that there wa3a rejoicing, that there was a
defeat of the British troops, and when one of
the incmbers said, that one of the king’s mes-
sengers had been killed ; and, if ithad been his
own father, he should have been giad, if he
had met with the same fate?—I think it was
the 21st.

Mr. Erskine.—None of your thinking, when
you have the paper in your hands !—I have
not a memorandum of the date.

What date have you taken, good Mr. Spy?
~-I do not think, upon such an occasion,
being a spy is any disgrace.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—These observa-
trons are more proper when you come to ad-
dress the jury.

Mr. Attorney General.—Really that is not
a proper way to examine witnesses. Lord
Holt held strong language to such sort of an
address from a counsel to a witness, who
avowed himself a spy.

Mr. Erskine.—I am sure I shall always pay
that attention to the Court which is due from
me; but I am not to be told by the attorney-
general, how I am to examine a witness.

Mr. Attorney General.—I thought you had
not heard his lordship.

Mr. Erskine.—I am much obliged to his
lordship for the admonition he gave me, I
heard his lordship, and I beard you, which I
should not have heard.

“What was the date when you say that pass-
ed, that there was a defeat of the British
troops, and somebody said, that there was a
messenger killed in the country, and he
should ‘have been glad if it had been his
own father?---When first I was introduced
into the 13th division, was on the 21st of
April, on a Monday. ‘

When was it you heard that conversation,
from whence you collected, that the reform of
parliament was to be carried at the pvint of
the bayonet?~-That was mentioned at the
armed society.

Have you got any date for that?---Yes; I
never was there but once, therefore I could
noe make an error in that; it was April the
2nd.

At what place ?—At Day’s.

Where is Day’s?-—In the Borough, near
the Grove; I believe it is called Worcester-
street.

How many persons were present at that
time?—-Some were going up stairs, and some
going away; to the best of my recollection
there might be twenty-two, twenty-three, or
twenty-four; I did not count them, as I never
expected to be called.

You must have expected it?—I had every
reason to suppose I should not be called.

I wish to know from you, whether, from
the conversation that you are now stating, of
obtaining a reform of parliament, at the point
of the bayonet, whether you collected this
from one person, or the general conversation
of the whole people?--It seemed to be the
opinion of the whole company, that a parlia-
mentary reform could not be obtained, but at
the point of the bayonet.

And you collected, that it was their inten-
tion so to carry it?—-Yes; from their general
conversation.

And you fix that conversation to the 2nd of
April, at this place ?—Yes. .


What was that you said about a bet ?—The
reason of my going there was to decide a bet ;
that was the way I first came to go there.

And you lost your bet ?---I did.

You made yourself a member of the Cor-
responding Society ?—I did.

And took those notes?—-I did.

-Why did you take those notes ?.--When I
once discovered, that an armed society of this
sort existed, which I thought of such danger-
ous tendency, I immediately gave notice to
the secretary of state.

How long after you had lost your bet ?--Be-
tween two and three days; but I mentioned
it before that bet was decided, that, if I lost
my bet,.{ should certainly acquaint the se--
cretary of state.

Should you know the faces of any of those
persons?-—I should, of two or three of them.

Should you know more of them?—I do not
think I should; I know the person in the
chair, Orr.

Was Franklow there ?---He was.

Do you know any body else that was there?
-—I think Williams was there; but I did nut,
expect to see sucha thing; I was very much
flurried and confused. ;

Edward Gosling sworn.---Examined by
Mr. Garrow.

Have you been for any time a member of
the London Corresponding Society ?---I be-
came a member on the {5th of April,

What April do you speak of ?--April, 1794.

Did you become a member, in consequence
of any communication between you and any
magistrate of the country ?---I had not been
directed to become a member, in consequence
of the recommendation of any magistrate ; I
had been unexpectedly proposed by Whittam, °
and a magistrate had told me, if another per-
son had proposed me. I should become a
member, :

Had you communicated with any magis-
trate of the country, before you communi-
cated with the society ?-—Not respecting the
Corresponding Society.

Who was the person that first introduced
you to the society ?---John Hillier.

Did you make application to him first, or
he to you?---I first went to Hillier, to make
some inquiries respecting a person who was a
member of that society.

What led you to go to Ilillier to make
that inquiry ?-—From seeing publications of
that nature, and I was informed that the per-
son respecting whom I was directed to make
the inquiry was a member of the Correspond-
ing Society. .

Publications of what nature ?---From seeing
publications in Hillier’s shop window, which
appeared to me to be of a seditious nature.

What business did Hillier carry on ?-~He
sold pamphlets.

From that you thought it likely he was a
member of the society, likely to give you in-
formation, there being some man you wanted
toinquire about?—-Yes.

When did you first make your application
to Hillier?—I believe towards the end of
March, or the beginning of April.

For what purpose did you become a member
of the Corresponding Society?---On the 14th
of April when I first became a member, I was
unexpectedly proposed, on the day following
T informed Mr. Wickham that I had done so.

What passed between you and the magis-
trate is not evidence, but in consequence of
what passed between you and him, why did
you attend the meeting?--To discover whe-
ther they had any serious intentions of
arming.

You have stated that you communicated
something upon the subject, to Mr. Wick-
ham ?— Yes.

Was it with his approbation that you at-
tended the meeting for the purpose you have
Dow stated?.--It was.

15th of April 1794. .

At what division ?---Division No. 11.

street, Clerkenwell; I do not recollect the sign
tightly, but the man’s name was Holt.

-Did Hillier introduce you ?---¥ es.

What number of persons were present at
tbat meeting ?---I cannot exactly tell, there
might be about thirty.

Did any thing material pass at that meet-
ing?---There was some conversation about
the proceedings at Chalk Farm.

Had the meeting then at Chalk Farm taken
lace ?--This was the day after the meeting
ad been atChalk Farm. ée

What passed with respect to the meeting
which had been had at Chalk Farm?---The
conversation turned that night principally
upon that, and some were talking hat it was
necessary to arm to protect the convention,
in the same manner as they had in France ;
I heard some present talking in consequence of
& convention having been talked of at Chalk
Farm ihat it would be necessary to arm to
defend that convention the same as they had
done to protect the Convention in France ; I
think it is proper to say that their minds
appeared at that time to be very much heated
from what had passed at Chalk Farm, and
therefore from that circumstance I did not
think so much of their being serious.

_-Do you mean that they were heated with
liquor ?---No, not with liquor.
hat was described to have passed at
‘Chalk Farm that should so have heated their
spirits ?---There were a number of resolu-
tions passed,

Do you recollect any of those resolutions ?
-~-Yes, [ remember one resolution, I can re-
member some circumstances which occurred
at Chalk Farm. .


That were stated to have occurred there~-
you were not there ?—-I was at Chalk Farm.

Then you were there before you became a
member ?---Yes.

State any circumstances that occurred at
Chalk Farm, particularly such as were men-
tioned in this meeting of the division the
night after P--There were a number of resolu-
tions read which I cannot repeat; but one of
them cgncluded with the words, brought the
head of Charles the First to the block, and
sent James the Second from the throne;
then a man, whose name I understood was
Birks, shouted. I remember a person, whose
name I was told Was Richter, mentioned that
he had, received a letter from Sheffield, I think,
but am not positive to the place, that a great
number of persons had met there, and that
they were determined to petition parliament
no more for a reform; that a convention
was intended to be called, and that, I think,
he said it was to take place in about six weeks,
or a shorter time, 1 cannot recollect the
positive words. .

Upon Birks’s shouting was any observation
made by any persons present at Chalk Farm?
---Some persons said that they thought bold-
ing up their hands was sufficient; this man
called out, that he wished to be heard at St.
James's. .

Do you remember Mr. Thelwall being
there?---There was a person there whose
name I was told was Thelwall, whom I never
saw before nor since. .

Did that person take any part in the con-
versation and debate that was going forward?
---Yes, he spoke several times. ;

Do you recollect any particular expression
that struck you that he made use of?.
thing that Mr. Dundas had threatened to
bring the Scotch laws into England, and if
they attempted it, they must repel force by
force, or something of that sort. .

Do you recollect what particular subject
respecting the Scotch laws was the subject of
conversation ?—I believe it related to same
persons that were tried.

What was the expression used P—That
infamous and ever to be detested Court of
Justiciary in Scotland. .

Do you recollect the remainder of that
sentence ?—I cannot say I have a positive
recollection ; I made no minutes at the time.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—You have better
evidence I suppose of the resolutions, than of
the conversation ? .

Mr. Garrow.—Was there any direction as
to the printing any number of copies of the
proccedings of the day ?—I think the number
that was ordered to be printed was two hun-
dred thousand.—I cannot say, whether one
or two hundred thousand copies of the resolu-
tions, if they should be wanted. a

Which was the next meeting of the division
that you were at afterwards?—On the Monday
following 1 was at the meeting of another
division, .

Where was that?—At the house of one
Morris, a jack-maker, in Brick-lane.

What division was that?—I believe they
call it sixteen and twenty-five.

Did any thing matecial pass at that time?
-~I do not recollect any thing particular, any
farther than doctor Hodson was recommended
by the committee to be relieved.

Where was he at that time, and what was
the purpose for which he was to be relieved?
| was no particular purpose stated,
only he was recommended for relief.

Did you go with Hillier next day to see
doctor Hodson?---I did.

.Where did you go to?—-To Newgate.
Whom were yoy introduced to there ?---To
doctor Hodson.

Did Hillier go with you?~--Yes. — -

Was there any gther person there besides
doctor Hodson ?---Yes, one Lloyd, Roussel a
Frenchman, and a captain Williams, an Ame-
ican,

Hillier was likewise there ?-- Yes.

Be so good as tell us what the nature of
the conversation was there in the presence
of Hillier, he being one of the. parties?---
The principa) conversation that 1 bad was
with doctor Hodson.

Was it in the presence of Hillier ?~-He was
there; all those persons were present; the
most material conversation that passed then
was from. doctot Hodson; he asked me if I

seen a copy of the new constitution, I
told him I was but a young member, and did
not know any thing of it; he then informed
me that there was a very clever one coming
out; the society was to be divided into divi-
Sins, and into small divisions, that the pur-
pese of that was for the convenience of learn-
ing the use of arms, at each other’s houses.

What more passed at that time?

[The witness refers to a paper.]

Lord Chief Baron Macdonald.—Did you
make that memorandum at the time ?—I did;
he informed me that those divisions were to
be called tithings; and that the purpose of

was likewise to keep spies from getting
among them, and betraying their intention;
he likewise stated, that.their numbers were
Increasing, and that they would soon. be too
formidable to be resisted. I made an obser-
vation, that I did not think, from what I had
seen in the society, that they appeared to be
men of property, to have money to effect any
thing, upon which a Frenchman, who was
there, got up and said, when the society was

ized, money should not be wanting.

7 ‘a8 this Roussel that you have mentioned?

—1les,
_ Did any thing more material pass at that
tme?—There were some toasts given, one of
which was given by Lloyd; the toast was,
“The World a Republic or a Desert :” doctor
Hodson said, he hoped soon to see a revolu-
Uonary tribunal established in this country,
for he despised all others,


He was then suffering under the sentence
of the law, I believe ?—Yes.

This was said still in the presence of Hil-
lier }—Yes.

Was any thing more said at that meeting
that was material ?—Roussel said he was
going from there to Thelwall’s, and he should
set off the nextday. Lloyd asked him, for
the continent, he answered, oui. Hillier asked
to France, he answered, yes.

When Uillier invited you to go to Newgate
to see those persons, who did he ask you to
go and see?—The persecuted patriots.

Is Mr. Lloyd confined upon any sentence
upon a criminal prosecution ?—I do not know;
Lioyd was part of the time writing; I heard
he wasa prisoner, but for what I do not know.

hen was the next meeting of the divi-
sion ?—I think it was the same evening I was.
at the division to which I belonged.

Which was that ?—TLhe eleventh.

Who were the persons that were present
there ?—One Wright a delegate, and Gordon.
who was secretary, and about thirty-six other
persons, I believe. .

This meeting was, I believe, at the Hope,
in Northampton-street, upon the 22d of:
April ?—Yes.

Who was the delegate at that meeting?—
His natme was Wright.

Do. you recollect any conversation of
Wright’s in the society, upon the subject of
arms?—After the society had broke up we
were coming away; Wright asked me if. I
had got any arms, I told him no; he said he
had got his musket, and that it was necessary
that we should all have arms, as we might
very soon be compelled to use them.

Was that said as well in the hearing of
other members as yourself?—Yes; the
secretary stated, that he was very sorry to leave
the society just as they were going to act as
well as think, and to regenerate their country.

Who was their secretary ?—IHis name was
Gordon, he was going to America; he said
he should take some copies of their spirited
resolutions to the popular societics there.

Did you hear any obscrvations upon the
subject ef arming trom Hillier, or any other
member of the society besides Wright, the
delegate?—Hillier said, he had not got a
musket, but he had got a pike.

Do you remember being presentat any time
at Hillier’s in the same month of April, on the
25th of April?—On the 25th of April I was
at Hillier’s; there were present a person
whose name I afterwards was told was
Wicksly.

Where is Hillier’s house >—No. 80 or 81,
Bishopsgate-street; I was told his name
afterwards wasa Mr. Hicksly, and two other

ersons, one of whom appeared much in
iquor, the rest were sober, and there was a
man of the name of Bennett, the secrelary to
the 16th and 5th divisions.

Was.there a person there who was a mercer
by. business ?—Yes, that was Bennett.


Were there same otner persons present? | of them, Bennett, went out with me into the

—There were those I have stated; Hillier was
present; the conversation was begun by this

erson, whose name Hillier informed me was

jicksly; he said he had received a letter
from Sheffield, which informed him that
they had a numerous meeting, and had deter-
mined to petition nu more for a parliamentary
reform; he likewise said, that this letter con-
tained the drawing of some knives which
were making there, of a particular construc-
tion, for cutting of reins; the letter contained
a drawing, with this observation---these are
tbe instruments we shall soon use.

What were they stated to be for?---To be
fixed against the end of poles, and to be used
against the military.

What were the knives for?---For cutting
the reins.

Cutting the reins of what ?---I do not recol-
lect whether he particularly explained that.

It was stated that those instruments were
to act against the military ?---Yes.

Do you mean stated in terms, or that you
collected that?---It was stated in terms ; it
was farther said, the principal dependance of
the socicty was in securing the royal family,
and both Houses of parliament.

One of the Jury.---What date was this ?~-
On the 25th of April ; he farther said, if they
could resist the first shock, there would be no
danger to be apprehended afterwards. :

If who could resist the first shock P---I con-
sidered it to be the members of the different
societies ; if they could resist the first shock
from the army, that there would be no fear
afterwards. .

Did they give any reason why the first shock
being resisted, there would be no fear after-
wards ?--- They said the royal family being se-
cured, the army would have no head to Took
up to, and would be glad to accept the addi-
tional pay that would be offered them.

‘Whom was that additional pay to be offered
by ?—-I understood by the societies.

Do you remember any observation that
Hillier made upon that additional pay being
offered to the army with respect to the com-
parison of sixpence a-day with any other sum?
--There was something said, I believe it was
cighteen-pence ; thatthe men would not fight
for sixpence a-day if they could have eighteen
pence---1 think it was, but I am not positive
to the sum.

Whether any of the persons present at the
time that these observations were made, and
these facts stated, made any objection to
them ?---None: but I think it is proper to
state that one person was very much in liquor,
and took no part in that conversation.

Those who conversed were not in liquor ?---

0.
Those to whom the observations were ad-
dressed, except the one who took no part,
were they sober ?-—Perfectly sober.
Did any one make any observation that had
a tendency to repress this conversation ?--One

Street, and his conversation was so violent,
and he spoke so loud, that I was obliged to
check him, and told him the people in the
street were hearing him.

Do you know a person of the name of Bax-
ter ?—I do.

Was he a member of the London Corres-
ponding Society ?—I have seen him at di-
visions.

At other times since that, have you heard
any observation from Hillier or Baxter, upon
the subject of arming? —On the 9th of May
was the most material conversation I had with
Baxter, that was at Hillier’s house; he said
he had been with an officer who had been
lately——

Who were the persons present besides Bax-
ter ?—Baxter, this Bennet, Hillier, a man
whose name I was told was Hill, and some
other persons, whose names I do not know,
were present during a part of this conversa-
tion ; Baxter stated, that he had been with
Mr. Joyce, who was secretary to earl Stan-
hope: Mr. Joyce told him there was no dan-
per to be apprehended from Stone, that Stone
had too much firmness to let them get any
thing out of him by intimidation.

Whom were you speaking of by the name of
Stone ?—A person I understood who was
confined in Newgate.

Did you understand he had been examined
before his majsty’s privy council?—I un-
derstood that he was committed upon a
charge of high treason; we had some con-
versation about Hamilton Rowan’s escape ;
he said, earl Stanhope’s speech was to be
printed, with an addition, which was to be
very cautiously put in ; he said, the committee
of correspondence and co-operation were pre-
paring an address to the army, with some
strong resolutions ; he said, that prudent and
determined men were wanted to propagate the
opinions contained in those resolutions. —*

Were they wanted to propagate them ?—
He stated, that one Moore had been particu-
larly active and successful in getting over the
army.

Did he tell you what description of the
army he had been more successful with
than the other?—He said, they had most
to fear from the*young recruits; they had suc-
ceeded best with the old soldiers in West-
minster; he said,if one-third of the army
was got over, the other two-thirds would not
act with spirit against them; he then asked
me if I knew any person who would buy a

ike.
: Whom are you speaking of now P—Baxter.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Who was it said
all this ?-~Baxter.

Mr. Garrow.-—Did he mention any thin
with respect to his interview with the officers?
—Yes, he said that the officers had made use
of an expression not fitto be repeated, and
asked him why he did not blow them all up
together; he said the officer had been lately
presented to the queen upon his promotion.


You think it an indecent expression ?—It is
as applied to such a person as him ; he said,
that the officer had asked Baxter why they
did not blow up the whole family together ;
he then asked me if I knew any friends who
would purchase a pike; I said I should have
no objection to purchase one, but that it
would be of no use unless I knew how to use
it; hesaid, if I went either the Thursday or
the Friday inllewing and made use of his
name at the sign of the Parrot, in Green-Ar-
bour-court in the Old-Bailey; I was to ask
for one Edwards, that he would be called out
to me, and I was then to tell him that Baxter
had sent me, and then I was to have a pike,
andI should be introduced to others, who
would learn the use of them with me, and that
Edwards was very clever at the use of it, and
would assist us in learning; he stated, that
pikes were much cheaper than muskets, and
that it would be impossible for the number to
procure muskets on account of the expense.
There is another cicumstance, he stated, that
Persons with muskets might do a great deal
of mischief if tNey did notknow properly the
use of them : I made an observation, that I
thought we might have a reform in parliament
without coming to blows; he said, is there
one man in the society who believes a parlia-
mentary reform is all we want—no, not one;
he said, that many menof property had hi-
therto kept back on account of the sanguinary
conduct of the French, but that they were
Now willing to come forward, as they were
convinced that a revolution might be effected
in a few hours ; he said, for his own part, he
did not wish the king, or any of his family, to
lose their lives, but ih thought they might go
to Hanover ; he said, it must be expected that
some blood must be shed: some particular
persons had offered such insults to the people,
that human nature could not overlook ; the
conversation afterwards turned relative to
Thelwall’s having been indicted, in which
there was nothing very material.

Was Hillier present during the whole of this
conversation of Baxter ?—Yes.

Was it pronounced in a way in which every
person might hear?—They might; but I did
Not pay much attention to any thing that fell
from him, from this circumstance—that Bax-
ter was one of the committee of correspon-
denceand co-operation; I thought I should ob-
tain most information from his conversation,
therefore I attended more to him.

Did he state whether any, and what num-
ber of pikes were ready at that time, at any
Place ?—Lle said, that many thousand were
Mmakiu.y at Sheftield, that the heads were only
to come irom there, but that thcy were to be
Stochud in wown,

Did he give any caution with respect to con-
Yersing in tie division-mecting, respectin;
the pikes, at that time?—He .recommende
that nothing of that should be mentioned at
any of the division-meetin 3, Ull the new con-
stitution should be adopted,

The new constitution of the society ?—Yes,

of the society: -

Did he give any reason for the necessity of
that caution?—Yes, he said, because there
were spies in the society.

Was there any thing said in the course of
this conversation with respect to the French
emigrants ?—It was stated by Baxter, that it
would be adviseable to let those who were
prisoners out, and, if the French emigrants
attempted to resist, they should share the fate
of spies at Paris.

What prisoners ?—The French prisoners of

war.

Did he name any of those persons who had
offered such insults to the people that human
nature could not overlook ?— He named se-
veral, I cannot recollect all; Mr. Pitt was one,
Mr. Dundas another, and Mr. Reeves,

And other persons ?—Yes,

In the course of thatevening, did you return
to your home in company with Baxter ?—I
went part of the way home with Baxter. ©

Did he, in the course of your going home,
enlarge upon any of the subjects you had been
conversing about ?—I understood that the
purpose of their address to the army was, to
excite a jealousy between our troops and the
French emigrants, which were fearon into
regiments ; he stated the means that Moore
had used to get over some of the army ; that
he had told them that by their oath they were
to fight for their king and country, but when
the king and country were at variance,
they had a right to fight on which side they
pleased. —

Did he state to you any of the other argu-
ments that Moore had used with the army /—.
He recommended that I should mix with
them, treat them with beer, and enlarge upon
the severity of their usage and the smallness
of their pay; but I must first sound their
principles, and if I found them aristocrats,
then I must not go on.

In the course of the evening, when this
conversation was had, was Hillier’s pike pro-
duced ?—I do not recollect that it was,

Was it produced at any time when any of
those persons were present with you?—It
was produced after that, at another meeting,
on the 16th of May.

Where was that meeting at P—At Hillier’s.

This is not a division meeting, but the
meeting of some few members ?—Yes.

Who were the persons present upon the
16th ?—I believe Iam wrong in point of date;
it was on the 17th of May.

Mr. Garrow.—The attorney-general sug-
gests to me, whether it is possible that I
should go into any examination respecting
facts which took place after the prisoner was
in custody ?

Lord Chief Baron Macdonald.—When was
he taken up? 5

Mr Garrow.—On the 12th of May.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—No, I think it
would not be proper.

Mr. Garrow.—Then we do not wish to
examine as to any facts which have happened
subsequent; I have at present confined my
examination to facts prior to his being taken
into custody. Do you recollect the circum-
stance of Mr. Hardy’s being apprehended ?—
Ido.

Had you any conversation with respect to
admission to the House of Commons? If
that was after Hardy was apprehended, I do
not inquire into it ?-—It was after.

Do you remember a paper being distributed
with respect to the Ins and the Outs ?—I do.

Where was that distributed? — At the
meeting at the Coach and Horses, in Hatton-

len.

Was that before Mr. Hardy was appre-
hended ?—It was after the apprehension of
Mr. Hardy.

With respect to all these circumstances that
you collected from time to time, you commu-
nicated them to Mr. Wickham, the magis-
trate, and with his approbation attended these
meetings P—I did.

And attended them for the express purpose
of giving this information ?—I did.

Edward Gosling cross-examined by Mr.
Erskine.

What is your christian name ?—Edward.

Edward Gosling ?—Yes.

Are your father and mother living ?—Yes.

What are you by employment or trade ?—
At present I am employed by Mr, Wickham.

I am not calling you to an account for any
general employment, if you are an honest
man in the execution of it; do you mean
employed in this business? — Yes, and in
writing too; I was employed before this bu-
siness by Mr. Colquhoun, in writing.

What sort of writing P—Both in Fis private
business and on his public business.

Mr. Colquhoun is an attorney, is he?—No,
a magistrate in Worship-street.

When did you begin writing for him?—
About September last, but that was only oc-
casionally.

What way of life had you been in before
that ?—Before that I kept a broker’s shop.

Were you a dealer in naval stores; I am
not asking any,question you can object to;
were you a dealer in naval stores?—I never
in my life, upon my oath, to my knowledge,
bought a store that ever was the property of
his majesty, if that is what you mean.

Mr. Erskine.—I should have no right to
ask that question.—I know the reason for
which it was put; and it is a question which
if I was notconscious of my innocence, I has
noright to answer, butasI knew I could safely
do it, I thought it proper to answer.

Then, perhaps, you have never said to any
body the direct contrary of what you are say-
ing now to me?—I did say the direct con-
trary; I was asked by Mr. Worship, when I
went to buy a print what I was? and what
my address was? as I conceived he would not


Jet me have the print if I told him I was with
a magistrate, I told him I dealt in naval
stores.

Did you never say to any body that you
dealt in naval stores, and that you should
think no more of cheating the king than of

illotineing him ?—Never to my knowledge;

will swear positively, I never mentioned
the word guillotineing the king.

Did you never say to any body, upon your
oath, that you lived by smuggling, and cheat-
ine the king in his stores ?—Never upon my
oath.

Have you always gone by the name of
Gosling?—I have not; and as means were
yesterday used to deter me from giving evi-
dence, I am willing to explain them, and am
willing to explain why I went by another
name ; as I find every advantage is wished to
be taken of me, I trust the mercy of the Court
will not suffer any improper question to be
put to me.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—As to any ques
tion which tends to accuse you of any crime,
not immediately connected with this matter,
I will protect you; but at the same time keep
your temper, attend to the question, and give
a direct answer.

Mr. Erskine.—I have treated you with ci-
vility Iam sure.—Did you ever go by the
name of Douglas ?—I did

When did you first assume the name of
Douglas?—I believe as much as ten years
since.

How long did you continue the name of
Douglas?

Gosling.—I would wish to relate the cir-
cumstances under which I took that name.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—You had better
answer the question.

I carried on the business of a hair-dresser
in that name, for I believe pretty near seven

years.
Where did Pha reside ?—In Westminster.
Where in Westmirister ?—In Petty France,

0. 8.

When did you first come to live in Petty
France, No. 3, as a hair-dresser, by the name
of Douglas?—It is about ten years since; I
do not know that I could state exactly the
time ; I believe, it must be about the year
1784.

I am not very particularas to dates, I do not
want to be in any of your secrets, if there can
be any reason in the world for your not
choosing to answer me —Had you any at
ticular reason for changing your namef—I
will state my reason; my father had a shop
of business in the city, his business was
chiefly in the wig and shaving way; for im-
provement I wished to go to the west end of
the town. I went and worked with a man,
whose name was Penton, in Bloomsbury, for
improvement; it was, perhaps, trom false
pride I did not choose it to be known that I
was working as 4 journeyman, when my
father kept four of five men; and as for

taking the name of Douglas, I took it from aj

play-bill.
I have no objection to a decent pride, you

took a very good name. It struck you ina}

moment to take the name of Douglas from a
play-bill?—That was the reason that struck
me at that time, and I had no thought of
continuing under that name.

. Pray how long did you play this part of
Douglas?—I continued near seven years in
that name, and it was from this circum-
stance——

Do you know a Mr. Lincoln?—I do, I did
not recollect him, but I wish to state some
circumstance.

Please to answer my question fitst, do you
know Mr. Lincoln ?.—I do. ;

Who is Mr. Lincoln ?—Mr. Lincoln I un-
derstand to be something to Mr. Macnamara;
be collects rents for him, I believe.

Did you at any time,—I am not asking you
eny thing that is criminal,—did you at any
time borrow any money of him?—I did, and
will state the circumstances if you please.

How long ago is it that you borrowed
any money, and what sum of him?-—I am
Upon my oath, I do not know the particular
gum, nor cannot state the particular time; -I
believe it is four or five years ago. ;

Was it ten guineas?—-Ten pound, or gui-
eas, I do not know which.

Did you give him a note for it ?—Yes, in
the name of George Douglas, part of which 1

id, part my.wife paid, and the remainder

ie has been since paid.

When did you pay part of it yourself?—I
cannot state the time.

Did not Mr. Lincoln come into the London
toffee-house by mere accident, where the
Witnesses for the crown are, I believe, pro-
vided with what is fit for them to have, and
gaw you there, and said, how do you do Dou-
glas(—Permit me to explain, that that was
Botthe way; that wouldcarry a different con-
struction from the manner in which it was
done. Mr. Macnamara first came himself,
whem I never had seen; he asked me ques-
fons; I told him a stair-case there with a
man [ had never seen, was not a place to
enter into an explanation upon the subject.

Tam not speaking about Mr. Macnamara,
but asking what passed when Mr. Lincoln
came into the London coffce-house ?—I was,

m Mr. Macnamara’s conduct to me, so
confused, that I hardly knew what I said.

Mr. Macnamara had been there before, and
hed behaved in-such a manner that you were
8 flurried that you did not know what you
said to Mr. Lincoln when he came in ?—I de-
clare, I did not recollect Mr. Lincoln’s person,
having never seen him but once or twice in
my life.

But you recollect what you said to me, not
two minutes ago; that Mr. Macnamara had
been there before, and had behaved in such a
fsanner, that when Mr. Lincoln came, you
were so confused, from Mr. Macnamara’s



conduct, that you hardly knew what yousaid? ~
+~I certainly did say 50,

He said to you, how do youdo Douglas ?—He
did not. When he came up, he asked me first
what my name was? I said, Edward Gosling;
said he, did you never go by any other name?
did not you rent a house of me? my name is
Macnamara ; J said, this is not a place proper
for explanation; he said, I came out of bu-
manity to you,--you know you gavea note to
Mr. Lincoln, some part of which is not paid,
and I only came out of humanity to you to
inform you, that when you appear in evidence
this will be brought forward.

What would be brought forward ?-—-This
note would be produced. I told him I had
not the money. I offered Mr. Lincoln the
money afterwards.

Did. you know where Mr. Lincoln lived in
the interval, between the time when you bor-
rowed the money from bim and to the time
you saw Mr. Macnamara and Mr. Lincoln
at the London coffee-house?—I knew where
he lived at the time I borrowed it; I do not
know whether Mr. Lincola had moved or not.

Had you seen him in the interval?—I paida
part of the money, and my wife paid another
partofit. It was to be paid by instalments.

Let me ask an explanation of something,
which I confess I did not understand; how
came you to say ty Mr. Worship that yoa
dealt in naval stures?—Because I thought that
would preclude all inquiry; because I did not
choose to give him my address; because
thought if he found I was with Mr. Wick~
ham, he would refuse then to let me have
what I wanted.

Mr. Attorney General.—Do you mean
Worship, the engraver ?—Yes; I saw he sus-
pected I was not friendly to their cause.

Mr. Erskine—Who 13 Mr. Worship?—A
secretary of a division of the Corresponding
Society.

Did you never make use of the expressions
that I asked you to before, that you cared no
more for cheating the king than the expres-
sion I stated before ?—Never in my life.

Task you, upon your oath, whether many
of these expressions, which you have been
stating to-night, you did not make use of
yourself, and endeavour to excite those people
to do the things that you have been relating
of them, and were reprimanded by them re-
peatedly for it ?---Never,

Upon no one occasion ?—~The only thing I
ever did, I will state: that, on the Tuesday,
after the apprehension of Hardy, I mentioned
what had passed at the division, in Compton-
strect, relative to the committee of emergency,
and to know whether it was their intention to
do the same.

Lask you, upon your oath, whether you
were not in the constant course of using in-
flammatory expressions, which I will not re-
peat, going from one society to another using
inflammatory expressions to excite those peo-
ple to say to you things which you wanted


“them to say ?---I never wished, and do not to
my knowledge know, that | ever used any one
‘expression of the kind; in some respects I
may have appeared to have approved of their
proceedings with the view which was my sole
design. I did not wishto lead Baxteron, nordid
I find fault with him, from this circumstance,
‘that as I had reason to believe, thatarms were
secreted, and it was my wish to discover where
they were, that they might be found, and the
«mischief prevented.

It was natural you should say nothing if you
went with a view of discovering that which
was dangerous to the public.—But I ask you,
whether you did not go about from place to
place using the most ‘inflammatory expres-
sions?---1 never did.

You say that positively ?---Yes.

That you never did use inflammatory ex-
pressions of the sort that you have been men-
tioning P--No. :

Dol understand you to swear positively
then, that you never made use ofany inflam-
matory expressions, when I put you in mind
.of some of them now.---Why do not the so-
ciety learn the use of arms, it would be of
great use, there isnothing to be done without
arms ?---] never made use of such an expres-
sion ever.

Nor ever made use of any expression of
that nature, to excite any of the people at the
socicties to believe you would do mischief of
any sort ?---No, never to my knowledge, I
never used any inflammatory expression, or
any means to excite them to disturbance, or
any means whatever.

Now go to your notes, and tell me what
days, apd at what places you attended in the
prosecution of that which was extremely laud-
able, if it was honest, the times and the
places.—But before I trouble you with that,
do you knowa Mrs. Coleman?—I do not.

Mr. Erskine.--Look across to the jury ?—
I donot know a Mrs. Coleman now.

ae you ever know a Mrs. Coleman ?—
T did.

Had you any dealings of any sort with her ?
—Certainly, she rented a shop of me.

Had you no dealingsof any other sort? Tam
not putting a question of any immoral na-
ture f—Certainly I had business, she rented a
shop of me.

Is that all?—She died at my house, and I
buried her.

Did she leave any will ?—Yes.

Whom did she leave her property to?—Her
property was partly left to one Burroughs, and
ay to one James Leech.

. Who made the will?—I wrote it.
» Do you know Mrs. Biffin ?—I do not.

You were very ill used about that business,
in which you ,had done nothing but that
which was right?

- Gosling.—How ill used?

Mr. Erskine.—I mean you got into some dis-
pute and trouble about it?—None at all, I
was-in no trouble about it.


There was no complaint made against you
ot any sort?—There was no just cause of com-

int.

Ido not ask whether there was any just
cause of complaint, but was there any com
plaint made against you by any body upon
the subject ?—1 cannot say I recollect the
particular circumstances that might pass,
there was a brother by a former husband
who came up out of the country.

Do not understand me to be doing so im-
proper a thing as to be imputing any crime
to you, and to ask you to reveal it; far from
it, I only ask whether any body was wicked
enough to make any complaint of your con-
duct in that case ?—I do not know that there
was any complaint.

Will you swear there was none---upon your
oath, was there no complaint made against
you upon the subject of this will?—TI canna
tell what complaints may have been made.

Upon your oath, was there not a complaint
made against you, to your knowledge, for fa
bricating this will?—-Never, that I know of.

Will you swear that ?---1 will swear I never
heard any such thing.

Who was Mr. Leech?—A man who was
formerly an apprentice, and kept a shcp
nearly opposite, who set up in opposition to
m

e.

In what trade ?---In the same business of a
hair-dresser.

And that woman died at your house and left
her property to him?---I did not say she left
her property to him. ‘

Tasked you to whom she left her property?
--I told pn to be divided equally between s
person of the name of Burroughs, at Edmon-
ton, and a James Leech.

Was that James Leech your rival oppo
site?---No.

Who was that James Leech to whom this
woman left this money ?---A son of my wife's

Who was Burroughs, who was that otha
person ?---A cousin of her’s or some such

tine.

hat connexion had you with the woman?
--I had no connexion, any farther than ren
dering her every service in my power, during
a long illness, in which I was at considerable
expense.

How long had she lodged at your house ?--
I cannot tell exactly.

A year P---I cannot tell.

Will you swear that she lived six months
with you ?—I do not know the time.
on ittwo months ?—It was longer than

at.

Three months ?---Longer than that.

Four months ?-—I cannot state to a month.

Was the will made by an attorney ?~—It vas
not.

By yourself ?---Yes.

Am I to take you that you mean to swear
now, that no complaint was made against yoa
as having forged that will?-—I swear, that to
the best of my knowledge or recollectivn, I
never heard such a thing. ‘

Will you swear positively, you never have
been charged with it; a man that is charged
with a capital felony cannot forget it?—I do
not recollect that ever I was.

od! Do you mean to swear that
you do not remember whether you were
charged with a capital felony or not ?—I do
not know that I ever was.

Will you swear positively that no such
charge was brought against you?—I can
swear no farther than, that tothe best of my
knowledge, it never was.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre —A charge brought
when and where ?—it may be a fact within
his knowledge, or it may not.

Mr. Erskine——I am asking you whether
there was not acomplaint made, that you were
charged in your own presence with having
done it ?—Never, to my knowlodge.

Am | to understand that there was not a
complaint made in your presence against you
for having forged that will?—I do not recol-
lect that any person ever did.

Will not you go the length of swearing that
nobody ever did do so?—I can only speak to
the best of my recollection and knowledge.

Mr. Garrow.—I submit to your lordship
that is the only answer a witness can make to
such a question. .

Lard Chief Justice Eyre.—There is no oc-
casion for your interrupting the examination ;
probably, it is an answer; but he may be
pressed to see whether he can answer farther
or not.

Mr. Erskine-—Whether any body ever
charged you with it in your presence?—I
never recollect that any person ever did.

Do you know a Mr. Coxi—Yes ; I know
Mr. Cox, a cheesemonger.

How long have you known him ?—I can-
ne exactly state how long I have dealt with

im.

Dealt with him in what?—In cheesemon-
gery and butter, and things of that kind, and
some hams.

cid the use of your family ?—Yes ; and to
sell.

I thought you were a hair dresser; what! do
you deal in hams ?—My wife kept a shop of
that sort, and I dressed hair.

Have vou never had any other sort of deal-
ings with Mr. Cox, than that which any man
has witha fair tradesman that bought hams
2 him in the ordinary course of business ?—

oO. -
And you swear that, positively ?—I do not
remember any thing else; if you name any
co charge, if1t comes within my know-

edge, I will own it.

Mr. Erskine.—I do not stand here to make
charges.

Gosling.—I purchased hams of him, and in
some there were great holes filled up with
mortar and stones.

‘Then the hams were of a bad quality, filled
up with mortar and stones?—Some of them
were.


Then Mr. Cox, the cheesemonger, seems to
have cheated you ?—Certainly ; he did not
use me well when I was ignorant in the busi-
ness.

Mr. Macnamara came in order to intimi-
date you from being a witness here ?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Consider whe-
ther it will be prudent to go into an examina-
tion upon that; if Mr. Macnamara has been
so imprudentas to go into a coffee-house, and
talk to the witness, it would be at best an
incautious thing for a gentleman to go where
the crown witnesses are, to enter into conver-
sation with them ; and, I think, it had better
not be done ; I hope no other gentleman will
do it.

Mr. Erskine.—I am sure he did not.

Mr. Garrow.—I shall examine to it.

Mr, Erskine.—Y ou will examine to it when
I have done, I suppose?

Am I to understand you to say, that you
never dealt at all in stores, I do not mean to
say dishonestly or improperly ?

Gosling.--W hat kind of stores?

Mr. Erskine.---Naval stores~-ship stores?
---I have purchased old cordage, bad sacking,
and such Pind of things; but those I do not
consider to come under the denomination of
naval stores.

What were the articles that you purchased?
—What is commonly called hand stufting,
used for making of paper.

Did you never say, 1 do not ask you whether
you did it, because I have no right to do that,

ut you never said that you were a dealer in
raw materials; that the person you spoke to,
asked you to explain it; and whether in
answer to that you said that you attended the
sale of his majesty’s stores at the dock-yards,
at Sheerness, and so on--that you were well
acquainted with the store-keepers, and that
you generally bought them at a fifth of their
value, by feeing the store-keepers tocondemn
them ?~-I never said that---I will relate to
you one circumstance upon which that is
taken :---I wished to get information respect-
ing them, and Mr. Colquhoun would give me
credit for that; it was upon that very business
I was taken into his employment to give intel-
ligence respecting that---f understood from

iliier that he had a relation who was a
quarter-master there, and I wished, through
his means, to obtain information for the
service of government.

Why you had a great deal upon your hands
-—-you say you told him the same as (Mr.
Worship ; you did not tell Mr. Worship that ?
—I told him I was a dealer in naval stores.

But did you tell Mr. Worship that the way
you dealt was by feeing the store-kcepers to
condemn them ?---No, I did not tell him that.

When you were reproved for that, did you
not justify your conduct, and say that you had
followed the practice for years, and thought it.
no crime to cheat the king.—-Never.

Was it in the service of Mr. Colquhoun,
that you bought that paper stuff and things?

-~I never bought any paper stuff belonging to
his majesty in my life, upon my oath.

But I ask you, were you both a dealer in
Stores yourself honestly; and were you em-
ployed as an informer to prevent other poople ;

eing dishonest?---I never had, to my know-
ledge, any charge brought against me for
dishonesty for it---1 obtained every infurma-
tion I could to prevent children and other
persons, that might be tempted to purloin
things-—the information was not given against
any person, but merely hints to prevent
piltering---no person was accused upon that
pepmationy, nor did I receive any reward
for it.

I do not comprehend you, explain to me
what was the reason why you told Hillier you
had been in the constant course of cheating
government in that fashion?---I did not tell
Hillier I had been in a constant, course of
cheating the king; he mentioned to me his
having a relation a quarter-master at the
yards, and to whom he talked of sending
some of the resolutions; I thought that from
him, as it is the quarter-master that puts up
the stores, that I might obtain some informa-
tion relative to those stores.

Is that an answer to my question? TI asked
you why you told Mr. Hillier you were in the
course of doing that which you have been
now stating.—I did not tell him I had been in
the course of cheating the king at all.

Nor any thing to that effect ?—I only told
him that I wasa dealer in naval stores, nothing
farther.

Did you ever tell him that there were great
quantities of copper conveyed out of the ducks,
and the manner in which it is conveyed out?
——Never, the manner in which it is conveyed

out.

Whether you did not tell him the copper
was conveyed out of the dock-yards in butter-
firkins?—No; I have given information to
Mr. Colquhoun. that copper has ‘been sent
away, but that was not from the king’s stores ;
but supposed to be copper fraudulently con-
veyed away.

iam asking you, whether you did not tell
him you had been employed yourself in con-
reying away this euprets—I never told him
that Twas employed; I wished to gain what
information I could from him, and that was
the sole purpose.

Did you ever tell him that you were ac-
qualnted with a woman who lived somewhere
about Tooley-street, and that there were
twelve hundred weight found upon ber pre-
“mises?—I told him ‘a had heard such a seizure
had been made, but I never saw the woman
in my life; had heard of it, and merely
related that I had heard that such a thing was
the fact.

Now I have nothing more to ask of you
except the dates, which you will be so good as
to give me with great correctness; what was
the first time that you attended any of those
societies ?—The 15th of April; upon the 14th,


I was at a meeting at Chalk Farm ; I became
a member on the 15th.

You never saw the prisoner atany of those
meetings ?—I should not know his person
again; I do not know that I did. .

What part of the meeting were you in at
Chalk Farm—were you in the room ?—No,
out in the grounds :in the crowd. .

what day were you at any division
meeting of the society ?—On the 15th of April.

At what place?—At the Hope, in North-
ampton-street.

What was the next time?—The Monday
following, I believe.

I wish you to be correct ?~-I do not know
that, I have not every paper with me. ;

But such papers as you have, that will
furnish me with dates, let me have them?—
On Monday following, I was at Morris's, in
Brick-lane.

What number of persons were there at that
time?—About twenty-five or twenty-six, [
suppose,

You did not know their persons ?—I knew
the persons of some of them.

Be so good as to name them ?—Bennet and
Hillier; there were other persons, captain
Williams, I believe, was there, an American.

And about twenty-four or twenty-five
sons ; now what was the next night ?—On the
Tuesday following, I was at the hope.: .

Were Hillier and Bennett there ?—Hilher
was there.

How many persons might be present there?
—About seven or eight and twenty.

I understand you to say the conversations,
you have heen relating, were not accidental
ones, but that it was the general scope of the
conversation almost every night ?—That night
at Morris’s I did not hear any thing about
arming.

When did you hear about arming ?—The
22nd was the night when the delegate Wright
made that observation, and the answer was
given by Gordon, the secretary.

What was the next night upon which you
heard any of those abominable expressions
which you have sworn to here ?—On the 29th
of April, there was a conversation about
arming.

On what night, and at what place was that
horrible expression made use of concetning
the king ?—That was not at a division, that
was at Hillier’s house.

What was the date of that?—That was the
25th of April.

Who were present?-A man whose name
Ewas tok! was Hicksley (who introduced the
subject by saying he had received a letter
from Sheffield), Hillier, Bennett, another per-
son, whose name I do not know, and anether
man who appeared to be in liquor

Are you eeraret to swear positively, that
you heard those expressions which yeu have
swot'n to?—I have
they are true.

And you stick to that?—I do.

ly sworn them,

Where were you upon the 29th?—At the
Hope.

Who were present at the, Hope?-—There
were two divisions met there that night, No.
11, and No. 6.

- What number were there of each ?—I sup-
pose about forty or fifty persons together.

Were there any expressions about arming
that night ?—There was a print proposed by
Worship the engraver, and recommended to
the use of the society.

Was there any thing about arming for the

of threatening the king, or overturn-
ing the government ?—No expression of over-
turning the government ; but it was recom-
mended to them to learn the use of arms.

But was any particular purpose stated ?—I
do not recollect, that there was any particular

se stated.

At what time, besides the two you have
spoken of, did you hear the expressions that
you have related ?—I have, at different times,
ofwhich I have not the dates, heard other
people speaking of it, and approving of it.
¥ Do you mean members of the society @—~

es.
What member ?—Birks, the same I saw at
Chalk farm.

What is his christian name ?—I do not

ow.

What did Birks say to you ?—I do not re-
collect the particular conversation, because I
did not minute the words, therefore I will not
attempt to swear to the conversation; I: like-
wise heard a man of the name of ‘Kelly, and
likewise I heard Eaton talk of arming.

Tt was an armed association of sixty people;
but armed for those wicked purposes you have
been talking of ?—1 heard Kelly say so, after
the apprehension of Hardy.

Edward Gosling re-examined by Mr. Garrow.

You said Worship produced an engraving
at one of the meetings; cast your eye upon
that paper; is that one of the engravings he
preduced [showing the witnessa copper-plate
print of the manual exercise.]?—I believe this
to be one of them; this was brought es a
proof it was to be published the next day;

brought it to the society, that they might
see it.

What have the soldiers got upon their
heads ?—He mentioned, that they were Sans
Culottes; and the caps on their heads were
te be coloured red.

This is an engraving of the manual exercise,
and of platoon in gi—Yes :

When you applied to him, lest he should
Suspect you were connected with a magistrate,
you told him you were 2 dealer in naval
stores ?—I did. 7:

And afterwards, in the rest of: the conver-
ee you kept up that representation ?—

Hew long is it ago since you gave a note to
Mr. Lincolb, Mr! Mavoaioares- Agent ?—F
cannot exactly state the time; about four or
five years.


. Did you give it to Mr. Macnamara, or to
Mr. Lincoln ?—To Mr. Lincoln.’

How much was the amount ?—Ten pounds,
or ten guineas.

How much, at this moment is due upon
that note ?—I believe three guineas.

Have you ever had any application from
Mr. Macnamara, for the money, till after
attending this court, in virtue of his majesty’s
writ of subpoena, and anrong the witnesses for
the crown ?—I never saw Mr. Macnamara in
my life before yesterday, not to know him.

I need hardly ask you, whether you had
had any personal application from Mr. Mac-
namara, to pay this money ?-- Never.

Had youhad any application, upon his part,
till you were subpcenaed as a witness ?-—I did
not see him myself; I heard Mr. Lincoln had
called upon me. :

How long ago ?---Three or four years ago.

Did Mr. Macnamara come to you alone ?---
I was sitting at dinner; a person came, and
said, some person came to speak tome; I
found Mr. Macnamara alone.

He said he came out of hamanity to you?
—He said, that he was 2 man of property, and
bad a large estate in the country; that he
was a friend to the king and constitution ;
that he would see strict justice done; and he
came out of humanity to me to let me know,
that this would be produced against me in
court.

If what?-—He did not say what.

Did Mr. Macnamara demand the money,
or desire you to pay it ? --He asked me, if I
remembered the circumstance ; I said it was
an improper place to enter into an explana- .
tion ; I did not know Mr. Macnamara’s per-
son; I told him, if he did, I must meet it in
court. :

You have been asked a vast number of
questions, respecting Mrs. Coleman’s will;
was there any suit instituted to dispute the
legality of that will ?-—None.

Was there any prosecution for that which
is called the forgery of it?-—None.

Was there ever, to your knowledge, any
complaint made against you, that there was
any thing foul in the transaction ?---Not that
I know of; the brother came to town, and apy
peared perfectly satisfied.

Was it, upon your oath, 2 fair, honest trans-
action, as far as you had any thing to do with
it; aye or no ?---It was.

[It now being half past one o’clock, om Fri-

day morning, the Court adjourned to nine
o’clock.] .

Session-house in the Old Bailey, Friday,
October the 31st, 1794.
Parsent,

Lord Chief Justice Eyre; Lord Chef Baron
Macdonald; Mr. Baron Hotham; Mfr.
Justice: Buller; Mr. Justice Grose; and

others his Majesty’s Justices, dec,

Thomas Hardy set to the bar.

Mr. Attorney General.—Y our lordship will
recollect that Mr. Gosling, last night, spoke
of a conversation, in Newgate, at which per-
sons of the names of Roussel and Hillier were
pean We are now going to prove, that

ussel was a member of the London Cor-
responding Society, with a view to produce
some papers found upon him.

Mr. John Gurnell called.

Did you find that paper ?-~Yes ; I found it
at Mr. Hardy’s house.

[It was read.]

. « 19th July, 1792.
“ Division 37, Number 47; Mr. Roussel, No.
4, Shepherd-street, New Bond-street.”

Mr. Bernard Bailey, sworn.—Examined by
Mr. Attorney General,

Look at that book (showing the witness a
pamphict, intituled, “ Explanation of an En-
cain of the Manual Exercise and Platoon

iring +] has that your hand-writing upon
it?-—1t has,

Where did you find that ?---I found it in
Mr. Roussel’s apartment.

Look at that song [showing it to the wit-
ness].—This has my hand-writing on it; I
found this in Mr. Roussel’s apartment.

Where was Roussel’s apartment ?—-In
George-street, Black-friars; Roussel was
present at the time.

Mr. Bernard Bailey, cross-examined by Mr.
' Gibbs.

Who was with you, when you found these
papers ?--- John Coomber, an officer.
. Who desired you to go?--Mr. Wickham, a
magistrate.
hen did you find them ?—On the 19th of

lay.
Mr. Gibbs.—1 submit to your lordship,
that, according to the rule iad down yester-
day, the song is not evidence, being found
after Mr. Hardy was taken up.
_ Lord Chief Justice Eyre. I wish it had
been observed before.
Mr. Gibbs.—-I wish it had; but I did not
know it till I came to the cross-examination
of the witness.

[The Court ordered the song to be struck
out of the evidence.]

~ Mr. Attorney General.—I submit to your
lordship, that the book must be evidence ;
because the book, your lordship sees, is an
explanation of the pareve plate, which has
been produced, and which was found before
the pons was in custody.

Mr. Gibbs.—How do T Tide that this was
jot: printed after the apprehension of Mr.

ly?
Lord Chief Justice Eyre-~The other was
found before ; the material objection is, that


this may have been printed afterwards; it
was found afterwards, and there is no evidence
of its existence before; therefore it must be
rejected, unless you are prepared to show, that
the printing existed before.

Mr. Attorney General_—The papers Iam now
going to produce were found, one in the cus-
tody of Mr.Martin, the other of Mr. Thelwall;
they were found in their custody certainly
after the prisoner was apprehended, but they
bear date in April, 1794; and they appear,
upon the face of them, to have been prepared
for the Chalk Farm meeting. .

Mr. Gibbs.-——I only wish to have lord-
ship’s opinion ; I do not mean to take up the
time of the Court; it seems to me, that there
is certainly the same objection to this paper,
as to those which were offered before, of
whatever date fey may be, unless they can
prove, either that they were in the possession
of the prisoner, or of some member of the
London Corresponding Society, before he was
apprehended, or that he put that date to
them; the circumstance and bearing of the
date certainly is not evidence:

Mr. Attorney General—Supposing the ob-
jection to be well founded, which I do not
admit, I believe I can prove, that the paper
had an actual existence in the month of April,
1794.

Mr. Gibbs.---Prove they existed in the |
session of some member of the London Cor-
responding Society.

Mr. Attorney General.—I will prove, that
they existed in the possession of Mr. Martin.

Mr. John Groves sworn.-Examined by Mr.
Law.

Were you present at the Globe-tavern, in
the Strand, on the 20th of January, 1794?--
I was.

At a general meeting of the London Cor-
responding Society ?-—It was.

. Were you a member of that society ?--No,
not at that time.

When did you become a member of thst
society ?-—Very early in the month of Fe-

haere.
Did you make any observations of the pro-
ceedings which took place on the 30th of
January, 1794?---Yes.

What was your inducement to become 8
wrailies of that society?~-I was desired 9
to do.

You became a member for the purpose of
discovering their proceedings ?—I was d
by a particular gentleman to go there for that
purpose, whose name I will mention, if you
choose it. i.

There is no occasion for mentioning the
name’; relate as well as you can what
on the 20th of January, 1794, at the Globe-
tavern ?—There was a very great assembly of
people there, and I believe Mr. Martin wss
called to the chair, who read ‘an’ address, and
I believe a Mr. Richter afterwards read #
over again.

Do you recollect any particular toast that j
was drank upon that occasion?—-I do not
recollect any particular toast now, but a great
number were read, and by the paper that
was printed I should be able to refresh my
memory.

You toe no paper that you had at the
time ?—I have none. :

Do you recollect any conversation held by
any of the members of that society at that
meeting—what was the language?—In ge-
neral the language was universal suffrage and.
annual parliaments; they were met for that
purpose.

Was it méntioned in that society by what
means those objects were to be obtained ?—
Not that day; I heard nothing that day about
the means.

Did you hear at any subsequent meeting
any conversation with any member of the
Corresponding Society by what means that
object was to be obtained ?—I always under-
stood that they were to be obtained

Mr. Gibbs—We do not mind what you
always understood; relate what any body said.

Mr. Law.--What was publicly professed in
any of the meetings of that society to be the
object and the means ?—By enlightening the
minds of the lower orders of the people, to
give them opportunities of instruction, that
‘they might know what the natural freedom of
all mankind was.

Did they say how they were to carry into
effect that purpose ?---By the distribution of
certain papers calculated for their understand-

ings.

‘ir Gibbs.—-Does your lordship think that
this sort of examination ought to go on with-
out mentioning the name of any person from
whom it came? it is, your lordship sees, ut-
terly impossible for us to have an opportunity
of contradicting this kind of evidence.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—If he knows who
the persuns were who mentioned these parti-
culars he is now stating, he ought to give
their names ; if he dues not know the names
of the persons, he should state it as being said
by persons of that society.

_ Mr. Law.—-Do you recollect any conversa-
tion held by persons whom you recollect to have
been members of the London Corresponding
Society respecting the means by which these
objects were to be obtained ?~—I cannot recol-
lect any particular person; but I may venture
to say It was the general voice of the society.
_ Did you hear any thing publicly expressed
iu the society about arms ‘—No, never.

Were you present at any lecture of Mr.
Thelwall’s?---1 have two or three times been
there,

What was the sort of exhortation, the ob-

ject of those lectures ?—-That is a matter of

opinion 1 believe, if I am allowed to give my
opinion upon those lectures I will.

Tam not asking your opinion of their ge-
neral tendency, but what was the substance
of them ?-—{t was'a general abuse of adminis-
tation altogether.

Did he speak of the branches of the legis-

lature ?---Certainly, in their respective capa-
cities.

In what manner did he represent them?

---In every way that was truly ridiculous.

In what manner did he speak of his ma-

jesty ?-—In terms of contempt.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre —What were those

terms of contempt?--I have heard him make
use of the word Solomon. :

v
Did you ever hear him speak of the House

of Lords and speak of the utility or inutility
of that branch of legislature ?---I have

What did he say about the House of Lords?

—He said that it was an aristocratic branch
that swallowed up almost every other funce
tion of the government.

Did he recommend the abolition of any of

those parts?---A new modellation he recom.
mended.

In what manner did he recommend them

to be new modelled ?---By the general sense
of the country. ‘

How to be taken ?---By annual parliaments

and universal suffrage.

Did he recommend any particular ineans of
obtaining those annual parliaments?—If I
understood him right, his meaning was——__
* Did you ever hear him mention a conven-
tion ?---Yes, by calling together the whole
body of the people.

Did he recommend that measure ?-—He
certainly did.

He recommended a convention for the pus-
pose of new modelling the government and
obtaining annual parliaments and universal
suffrage ?-—Yes.

Were you present at Chalk Farm ?-—I was,

On what day were you there ?—If I recol
lect right, the 14th of April.

Was there a very large assembly of persons
there ?-—-There was a very large assembly of
persons there.

Do you know the persons of any present ?
---I do now know, I was not ‘then sufficiently
acquainted to describe them, but since I have
4 means of knowledge. :

Do you know the prisoner ?---Yes.

Was he among the persons present ?-—He
was.

Who was in the chair?—I believe a man
of the name of Lovett.

What passed at that mipeLNs ?—There was
a letter read from a society called the Frieads
of the People, which letter contained —

Lord Chief Justice Eyre-—No matter, you
must not state the contents of the letter.

Mr. Law.—-State any conversation and
transactions at that mecting which you re-
collect by any persons whom you have since
known to be members of the London Corres-
ponding Society ; what was proposed to be
done there?—The proposal was, that thére
should be an address.

Have you no other recollection of what you
heard read or spoken?—If I may be allowed

to look at a paper J have in my pocket.


Lord Chief Justice Eyre---If he can speak
to any particulars that happened there beyond

the address, and what is contained in the ad-

dress, to be sure it will be proper to examine
him toit; I believe the address is in evidence.

Mr. Attorney General.---It has not yet
been read, but I am going to read it.

Mr. Law.--Were any printed papers deli-
vered at that mecting ?-—There were.

Have you any of them ?—I have. [produces
a copy.]

[It was read.]

“ At a General Mecting of the London Corres-
“ ponding Society, Ae/d on the Green, at
“ Chalk Farm, on Monday the 14th of April,
“1794, J. Lovett in the Chater, the follow-
“ing Letters were read :

“ To the Chairman of the Society of the Friends
of the People.

 Sir;—At a crisis so important as the pre-,

sent there needs no apology on the part of the
© London Corresponding Society,’ for address-
ing itself to all other associated societies, who
have in view the same object as themselves.
To the ‘ Society of the Friends of the
* People,’ arguments are not wanting to show
the importance and absolute necessity of a
full and fair representation of the people of
Great Britain. They have investigated the
subject for themselves; they have exposed to
the world a series of plain and indisputable
facts, which must excite in the mind of every
man well disposed to his country, apprehen-
sions of alarm for the security of the few re-
maining vestiges of liberty, from which, as
Britons, we derive consolation.
Deeply impressed with considerations of
_ this nature, the London Corresponding Society
earnestly solicits, at this time, tle concurrence
and assistance of the Society of the Friends of
the People, in assembling, as speedily as the
nature of the business will admit, a Coaven-
tion of the Friends of Freedom, for the pur-
pose of obtaining, in a legal and constitutional
method, a full and effectual representation.

‘ Our request is not made from the impres-
sions of the moment, but after the maturcst
deliberations on the value and importance of
the object for which we are contending, and
of the difficulties we may expect fram those
whose present interests render them hostile
to the welfare of their country.

“The opposition of such persons is no
small argument for the goodness of our cause ;
and their late conduct when compared with
their former professions, exhibits a depravity,

leled, we trust, on the page of history.

“ Under the a ay of apostate reformers,
we have lately beheld serious and alarming
encroachments on the liberties of the people.

“ We have seen with indignation and horror
men legally and peaceubly assembled, dis-
persed by unconstitutional powers, and: their
papers seized.

* We have scen some of our most virtuous


brethren, whose only crime has been an imi.
tation of Mr. Prrr and his associates, sen-
tenced to fourteen years transportation, with-
out the sanction of law or even of precedent,
of which number, one was held up in the
British parliament as convicted and condemned,
before he was even put upon his trial.

“The insidious attempts also to introduce
forcign troops into this country, without the
consent of parliament, and the intended bill
to embody foreigners into his majesty’s ser-
vice, are measures suthciently calculated to
awaken our fears for the existence even of the
name of liberty. Nor can we overlook that
part of the present system of corupeih,
which maintains out of the public plunder,
train of spies, more dangerous to society than
so many assassins, whose avowed business is
to destroy the friends of the country, one by
one,

“ These are grievances which demand im
mediate redress, and when added to thos
evils which are necessarily connected with
every partial representation of the people, cs!
for the strenuous exertions of every live Cs
his country.

“ But we are told that the present is not
the time for reform, and that innovation may
introduce disturbance. Are those persons to
judge of the proper time to make returm, who
exist only by corruption? Are the people of
Britain to endure every thing without re-
pining, without ardently seeking a radical
reform, because disturbances may happen?
Have the enemies to reform told us whence
these disturbances are to originate? Mas a
single overt act been committed by the friends
to freedom? Have not all the riots, all the
public disturbances, all the seditious assem

lies been excited by the enemies to reform?
And do they mean to tell us that they will
still find other instruments for their wicked
designs ; that they have yet those who will
act over avain the outrages that have been
perpetrated in some parts of Britain, and at-
tempted in others ?

“Tf such is the determination of those per-
sons hostile to a fair representation, /et them
look to the consequences, but let them recollect
that it has happened, and may happen again,
that those who kindled the flames have
perished by them.

“ The friends to reform are friends to peace,
their principles can be promoted only by
peaceable means, they know of no other me
thod of obtaining the object they desire. But
they will not be alarmed by the threats ot
venal apostates, they will not draw back be-
cause they have seen some of their best friends
doomed to exile. They will pursue the course
in which they have begun, and turn neither
to the right nor to the left. .

“ Convinced as the London Corresponding
Society is, that as there is no power which
ought, so there is no power which oan finally
withstand the just and steady demands of 3
people resolved to be free ; they will thesefare
look with confidence to the determination, and
they hope to the co-operation of the ‘ Suciety of
‘ the Friends of the People, m the attainment
of an object which involves the dearest inte-
rests of society.

“ Convinced also that their intentions are
of the purest kind, they will never stoop to
answer the calumnies of their enemies; but
will at all times, and in all circumstances, en-
deavour, by firmness and perseverance, to
deserve the countenance and approbation of
the best friends of their country, the friends of
a fair Representation of the People of Great
Britain. —I am, sir, tor the London Corres-
ponding Society, ‘THOMAS HARDY, Scc.

“ April 4, 1794.” .

“ COMMITTEE ROOM,

“ Frith-street, April t1, 1794.

s¢ Sir ;—Your letter of the 4th instant, ad-
dressed to Mr. Snertpan, chairman of: the
FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE, was laid be-
fore that SOCIETY at their meeting on Sa-
turday last; and they instructed their com-
mittee to thank the LONDON CORRES-
PONDING SOCIETY for their communica-
tion, and to express the alarm they feel in
common with every Friend ot Liberty, at the
late extraordinary proceedings of Government,
so ably detailed, and so justly reprobated by
your Society. They assure you that all the
Friends of Reform, may ‘look with confidence
“to the determination and co-operation’ of
this society in every peaccable and constitu-
tional measure, which shall appear to them
calculated to promote the object of their in-
stitution; but they do not think that which
is recommended in your letter, is likely to
serve its professed purpose. ‘They fear it will
furnish the Enemies of Reform with the means
of calumniating its advocates, and so far from
forwarding the cause, will deter many from
eountenancing that which they approve. For
these reasons, the Friends of the People must
decline to send Delegates to the convention
proposed by the London Corresponding So-~
eiety :—at the same time they renew their
assurances of good will, and desire of preserv-
ing a proper understanding and cordiality
among all the Friends of Parliamentary Re-
form, notwithstanding any difference of opi-
nion that may occur as to the best method
ef accomplishing it.—In the name, and by
order, of the committee,
+ (Signed) “ W. BRETTON, chairman.”
«To Mr. T. Hardy, Secretary to

the London Corresponding Se-

ciety.”

*-Mr. Law.—Was that letter from the Friends
of the People read there ?—It was.

How was it received? — With universal

silence, I believe; I do not recollect any ap-
probation of it.
* Do you recollect any marks of the con-
trary ?.— Yes, there was some few fell a
hissing. a


« The following RESOLUTIONS were then
N passed Unanimously :

- Resolved Unanimously,—1. That this so-
ciety have beheld with rising indignation,
prepemone’d to the enormity of the evil, the
jate rapid advancesof despotism in Britain; the
invasion of public security, the contempt of -
popular opinion, and the violation of all those
provisions of the Constitution intended to pro-
tect ‘the People against the encroachments of
Power and Dreetistive, ;

“2. That our abhorrence and detestation
have been particularly called forth by the late
arbitrary and flagitious proceedings of the
Court of Justiciary-in Scotland, where all the
doctrines and practices of the Star Chamber,
in the times of Charles the 1st, Have ‘beer
revived and aggravated ; and where sentences
have been pronounced in open violation of
all law and justice, which must strike deep
into the heart of every man, the melancholy
conviction that BriTons ARE NO LONGER FREE.

“3. That the whole proceedings of the late
British Convention of the People at Edin-
burgh, are such as claim our approbation an@
applause. :

4, That the conduct of citizens Mancaror
and Gerratop in particular, by its strict con-
formity with our wishes and instructions, and
the ability, firmness, and disinterested
triotism which it so eminently displayed, a
inspired an enthusiasm of Zeal and Attach-
ment which no time can obliterate, and no
persecution remove; and that'we will pre-
serve their names engraven on‘our hearts till
we have an opportunity to redress theiy
wrongs. .

«5. That any attempt to violate those yet
remaining laws, which were intended for the
security of Englishmen against the Tyranny
ot Courts and Ministers, and ‘the Corruption of
dependent Judges, by vesting in such Judges a
legislative or arbitrary power (such as has
lately been exercised by the Court of Justi-
ciary in Scotland) ought to be considered as
dissolving entirely the social compact between
the English nation and their Governors; and
driving them to an immediate appeal to that
incontrovertible maxim of eternal justice, that
the safety of the people is the suPREME, and in
cases of necessity, the ONLY law,

“6. That the arming and disciplining in
this country, either with or without the con-
sent of parliament, any bands of emigrants
and foreigners, driven from their own country
Jor their known attachment to an INFAMOUS
DESPOTISM, is an outrageous attempt to orer+
awe and intimidate the free spirit of Britons;
to subjugate them to an army of mercenary
cut-throats, whose views and interest must of
necessily be in direct opposition to those of
the Nation, and that xo pretence whatever
eucnt to induce the people to submit to so
unconstitutional a measure. ;

“6. That the unconstitutional projevt of
raising money and troops by forced benevo»

3B

lences (and no benevolences collected upon
fequisition from the king or his ministers can
ever in reality be voluntary) and the equally
unjustifiable measure of arming one part 0!
the people against the other, brought Charles
the first to the block, and drove James the
second and his posterity from the throne;
and that consequently ministers in advising
such measures, ought to consider whether
they are not guilty of high treason.

“8. That this society have beheld with’

considerable pleasure the consistent respect
-- which the House.of Lords displayed for their
own constitutional rules and orders, on the
4th of the present month, upon the motion of
Earl Stanhope, concerning the interference of
ministers in the internal government of
France; and that it is the firm conviction of
this society, that this circumstance when pro-
perly detailed, will have a considerable effect
in convincing the country at large, of the
true dignity and utility of that branch of HIS
MAJESTY’s PARLIAMENT.
-_ “9. That the thanks of this meeting be
given to Eart Stanuore, for his manly and
patriotic conduct during the present session of
parliament ; a conduct whic! (ueeyperteal as
at has been in the senate, of which ne is so
truly. honourable a member) has, together
with the timely interference of certain spirited
and patriotic associations, been nevertheless
already productive of the salutary effect of
chasing the Hessian and Hanoverian Merce-
naries from our coasts; who, but for these
exertions, might have been marched perhaps,
ere this, intu the very heart of the country,
together with others of their countrymen, to
have peopled the sarracxs, which every
where insult the eyes of Britons. -

“ 40. That it is the firm conviction of this
society, that a steady perseverance in the
same bold and energetic sentiments, which
have lately been avowed by the Friends of
Freedom, cannot fail of crowning with ulti-
mate triumph, the virtuous cause in which
we are engaged; since whatever may be the
interested opinion of hereditary senators, or

acked majorities of pretended representatives,

tuth and Liberty, in an age soen lightened as
the Present, must be Invincible and Omnipo-
tent.

“ This Society having already addressed M.
Margarot, their Delegate, an ADDRESS to
JOSEPH GERRALD was read as follows,
and carried unanimously.

“To JOSEPH GERRALD, a prisoner sen-
fenced by the High Court of Justiciary of
Scotland, to Transportation d the
Seas for FOURTEEN YEARS?

“ We behold in you our beloved and re-
wet friend and fellow-citizen, a Martyr to
the Glorious Cause of Equal Representation,and
we cannot permit you to leave this degraded
country without expressing the infinite obli-
gations the people at large, and we in parti-


cular, owe to you for your very spirited exer—
tions m that cause upon every occasion ; but
upon nene more conspicuously, than during

f | the sitting of the Britis Convention of the-

PEOPLE at Edinburgh, and the consequent
proceeding (we will not call it trial) at the ber
of the Court of Justiciary.

“We know not which most deserves our
admiration, the splendid talents with which
you are so eminently distinguished, the exalt-
ed virtues by which they have been directed,
the perseverance and undaunted firmness
which you so nobly displayed in resisting the
wrongs of your insulted and oppressed coun-
try, or your present manly and philosophical
suffering under an arbitrary, and till of late
unprecedented sentence: a sentence one of
the most vindictive and cruel that has
been pronounced since the days of that most
infamous and ever-to-be-detested Court of
Star-Chamber, the enormous tyranny of
which cost the first Charles his head.

“To you and your associates we feel our-
selves most deeply indebted. For us it is that
you are suffering the sentence of transporta-
tion with felons, the vilest outcasts af so-
ciety! For us it is that you are doomed to the
inhospitable shores of New Holland ; where,
however, we doubt not you will experience
considerable alleviation by the remembrance
of that vinrvous conpuct for which it is im-
posed on you, and by the sincere regard and
esteem of your fellow citizens.

“ The equal laws of this country have, for
ages past, been the boast of its inhabitants;
but whither are they now fled? We are
animated by the same sentiments, are daily
repeating the same words, and committing
the same actions for which you are thus in-
famously sentenced ; and we will repeat and
commit them until we have obtained redress;

et we are unpunished! either therefore the
law is unjust towards you in inflicting Py
nishment on the exertions of Virtue and Telents,
or it ought not to deprive us of cur share in
the story of the Martyrdom.

“ We again, therefore, pledge ourselves to
you and to our country, never to cease de-
manding our rights from those who have
usurped them, until having obtained an Equal
Representation of the People, we shall be
enabled to hail you once more with triumph
to your native country——We wish you
Health and Happiness; and be assured we
never, never shall forget your Name, your Vir
tues, nor YouR Great ExamPte.

“T, HARDY, Secretary,”

Mr. Law. With whom did you go to this
meeting ?—I went from a place in Store-street,
Tottenham-court-road, a good part of the way
with Mr. Thelwall.

.How came you to know that the meeting
was to be held at Chalk Farm? Had you any
Teason to expect it to be held at any other
place?—I had reason at first to believe it
would be held in Store-street.

* Was the change of place intimated to
you ?—Not till after I gotto Store-street.

Who told you it was to be at Chalk Farm?
Thelwall.

Did he tell you why it was given out to be
held in Store-street ?—If I recollect right, he
told me the reason given out of its being to be
held in Store-strect was, an imagination of
the magistracy interfering to prevent the
Meeting.

. Were there any written or printed papers
giving notice at Store-street, informing per-
sons the meeting would be held at Chalk
Farm P—Yes, 8 written notice of it put upon
the door, ;


Who proposed Mr. Lovett’s being put in
the chair?—I cannot say.

Who were the principal persons who spoke
and acted in that meeting ?—Mr. Lovett, Mr.
Richter, Mr. Thelwall, Mr. Hodson.

Did Mr. Thelwall make a speech at thak
meeting ?—Two or three. ;

Do you recollect any thing particular in
either of those speeches respecting spies or
informers ?—There was a clamour went round
that there were spies and informers there;
Mr. Thelwall was for admitting all spies and
informers there, because the number of the
members of the London Corresponding So-
ciety, could be no agreeable news to the
minister.

Who read the resolutions?—T think Mr.
Richter.

‘Do you remember any objection being
made to the words ‘ a British Senate,’ in one
of those resolutions?—I think there was.

By whom was that objection made?—I
cannot tell.

Do you recollect Mr. Thelwall saying any
thing upon that subject?—As far as my be-
lief goes, I can say, but no farther.

After that meeting was over, where did you
adjourn to ; where did -you spend your even-
ing; do you recollect any thing particular
that Mr. Hardy said or did at that meeting?
—lI only recollect Mr. Hardy speaking three
words: Mr. Richter was sg ond in the
midst of his reading he stopt shart to make
some ~observations of his own; Mr. Hardy,
who stood below, said, looking up to him,
‘ read, Sir, without comment’; Lhat was all he
said, and that is the whole I recollect of Mr.
Hardy's saying afy thing at all.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—W hat was Richter
reading at that time?—The paper that has
been just read. ‘

‘Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Which of those
papers ?—The address of the London Corres-
ponding Society. :

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—The general
address; the address to Margarot; or, the ap-
probation of Hamilton Rowan, aad the rest?
—I mean the general address.

Mr. Law.—Do you remember any mention
of a future meeting to be held-of the society ?
—There was a talk of a meeting to be called
again soon. .

Do you recollect who mentioned that ?—

0.

After the business of the day was over,
where did you adjourn to for supper?—I went
to the division room in Compton-street.

Were suppers provided at other divisions ?
—I do not know, I never went to any but my
own division.

Who was chairman ?—Mr. Thelwall.

Do you recollect any remarkable language
used by Thelwall during supper, or in ¢
course of that evening?—I heard something
which very much astonished me. _

What was it?—Thelwall said, taking up 2
pot of porter in bis hand, which had been de-

livered him by some waiter or somebody, he
blew off the head of the porter, and said this
is the way I would have all kings served, or
this is the way I would serve all kings, I
know not which.

But one or other of those expressions you
are certain to ?—One or other 1 am certain of.
von there any particular toast given ?—

es.

What was that toast ?—The lantern, at the
end of Parliament-street.

The lamp-iron?—Yes, I beg pardon, the
Jamp-iron, a! the end.of Parliament-street.

Did he call upon any body else for another
toast ?—He called upon somebody to cover it.

What was it covered with ?—Somebody,
whom I know not, in the further end of the
room, cried out, the ‘Treasury-bench.

Were those toasts drank by the persons
then assembled ?—They were.

And the persons assembled consisted of
members of that division of the Corresponding
Society ?—Yes, I should believe that no visi-
tor was there that night.

Do you know a person of the name of
Green ?—Yes.

Is he a member of. the Corresponding So-
cjety ?—Yes, he was at that time.

What conversation had you with him at the
time he was a member of the Corresponding
Society, respecting universal sufirage, and an-
nual parliaments ?—-That was not in the divi-
sion ruom.

What did he say respecting the geneyal ob-
ject of their plan, what they iined at attain-
ing ?—He once said to me that annual par-
liaments and universal suffrage were only
ladders to obtain their ends, or words to that
effect.

Was he of the same division with yourself?
—He was.

Where was it?—In a place called the cof-
fee-room, before you go into.the division
room.

_ One of the Jury.—Was it that same even-
ing you have been speaking off—No, I am
not speaking of that same evening.

Mr. Law.—Where is the house in which
this passed?—No. 3, in Compton-street, Soho.

Did he say any thing respecting the use
parliament was of Yes. .

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Was there any
body else present, or was that a conversation
between you two only ?—Between us two,
there were several other people in the place
called the cofice-room.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Were they near
enough to.hear this conversation ?—I do not
think any one was. | : .

Mr. Law —Did Green show you a knife of
any particular construction?—I must explain
that by something which happened previous
toit. Atthe meeting at Chalk Farr, there
was a kind af shed in which we were all sit-
ting previous to the commencement of the
business, and there was a bit of bread and
cheese and some porter brought: . J. waa. sit-


(1

ting with halfa dozen or ten in the same box,
and I was surprised by five or six of them
pulling out little instruments exactly corres-
ponding with each other.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—What sort of an
instrument ?—I mean a sort of thing called a
couteau secret, a French knife.

Mr. Law.—Describe the form of them,
have you got one of them ?—I have nat.

Have you seen a French knife ?—Yes, there
is a spring, so that when the blade is put out,
unless you undo that spring it cannot close.

Were they fixed like a common case knife?
—Exactly ; and unless the spring fails, the
person cannot cut himself by its flying back.

You observed several of them with those
knives?—I think five or six.

You do not recollect, I believe, who the
persons were that were using themi—Yes,

one.

Who was that?—His name was Pearce.

Having seen these knives when in company
with Green, and he was making this dec
tion, did you apply to him about a knife, or
did he show you a knife of that same con-
struction?—It was in consequence of the con-
versalion I learned; when I saw five or six of
them with knives of the same description, an
observation was made by one of the company
that they were bread and cheese Fates, and
upon that observation there was a smile; I
looked upon them as harmless instruments
certainly.

Did you learn from Green what number of
these knives he had sold?—I asked where
they were to be bought, and I was told I
might get them of Mr. Green ; I asked where
Mr. Green lived, they told me in Orange-
street; there was a man from Sheffeld in
the box whose name I do not recollect, his
person I well know.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre-—Did you know
where Green lived at that time ?—I did not,
I asked where they were to be bought; one
of the company said at Mr. Green’s ; I asked
where be lived; they said he was a perfumer
and _hair-dresser in Orange-street, Leicestet-
fields.

Did you go to buy one?—In about a week
after I did.

Did you learn from Green what number of
these knives he had sold ?—I think he said
two or three hundred; Mr. Green told me to
speak very low, for the parlour-door was open
which was adjoining the shop, and he
and said, for my wife is a damned aristocrat.

Did you attend afterwards a meeting «
your division, which I think was No. 2, in
Compton-street, on the 28th of April ?—I can-
not recallect exactly the day, but I believe I
attended regularly.

Do you recollect ‘any observation made by
Pearce, respecting those knives, and the use

“and convenience of them?—At the meeting

at Chalk-farm he did. .
What did he say about the convenience of
these knives?—He said, if you strike with

them they will not fly back, or words to that
purpose.

Pearce is a person whom you are sure you
saw using one of these knives at Chalk-farm?
—Iam very sure of that; there was a man
from Shefheld, who found fault very much
with the construction of these knives.

What was the fault he found with them ?—
That they were made in a bungling manner,
that they were not equal to those made at
Sheffield.

Did he mention that there were man
others of a similar construction made at Shel-
field ?—He did.

You say you do not recollect the day of the
month ?—No.

Were you present at any meeting, when
any subscription was made for ddéctor Hod-
son?—Yes. .

Where was any subscription for this doc-
tor Hodson proposed when you were present?
—In the division.

Do you recollect when that was?—I do not
recollect the date of that.

” Was such a subscription proposed?—There
was.

Was any thing collected under that sub-
scription ?—That I cannot say, I think to the
contrary ; I think they said he had been re-
lieved : I am bound to speak the truth, and
therefore must certainly add this to it, that
the application for relief was rejected on the

und of the violence of that person's con-
duct, and I think there was another reason if
my memory is right; he was not considered
asa member of the London Corresponding
Society.

I believe you were present at the dinner at
the Crown and Anchor-tavern, on the second
of May ?—I was.

Before I go to that, I will just ask you as
to one meeting at an earlier period, the 25th
of February 1794. Do you recollect bein
present ata division-meeting, when any
dress from Stockport was read ?-—Yes. ’

Have Mes that address about you?—I do
not think I have. ;

Lord Chief Justice Eyre-—What day ?—In.
the month of February.

Mr. Law.—Can you ascertain at what part
of the month ?—No.

What was the number of your division ?—

0. 2,

I thought tha: had been the number of the
house ?—Number three was the number of
the house, No. 2, the number of the division.

Look at that paper, and say, whether that
is the paper that was read at the meeting in
February last, at your division? —This paper I
am very sure was delivered; I need not look
at the contents, because there are my initials

upon it.

peculiar care of Him who delights to da his
heedy creatures good, not satisfied with the

good of the land

“ The following reasons are at least satis-
factory to myself :—Because, in the time of
national prosperity, house and land rent (con-
sequently provisions) are always raised by the,
wealthy and voluptuous, till they are, at least,
at par with high wages; but, when Waa, or.
any other cause, has ruined or impeded com-
merce, and reduced sues penis and provia
sions remain unabated. The poor callico-
weavers in the vicinity af Manchester, noto-
riously illustrate thig argument, as they are
now (they who can get any) working for fifty
and sixty per cent. less wageathan at this time
twa years back, and the necessaries of life are,
rather augmented in their prices than dimir
nished |!! :

“ Hearken, O ye poor of the Land! While
great men have an unbounded power to raise
their rents and your provisiona—-and, at the
same time, an uncontrolled power to make
War, and consequently to dry up, or diminish,
the sources of your income, your subsistence
will, at tha beat, be precerjaus, and your very

existence often miserable !—The present want
of bread amongst the poor, is not owing to
the want of grain in the world, nor, I presume,
in this land, but owing to the price of it being
excessively above the price of labour. When,
therefore, the price of labour cannot be brought
up to the rate of provisions, provisions should
be reduced to the rate of labour. Till this is
practicable, the poor are miserable !

During the last twenty years, mechanical

wages have been varied, according to circum-
stances, several times, and not unusually in
some branches, twenty, thirty, forty, and even
fifty per cent.---I mean on the lowering, as
well as the rising side of the medium. But,
with regard to lund-rent, its variations have
always heen progressive ; and to find a single
instance to the contrary, would be almost, if
not altogether, impossible !
* “Tt requires but little sagacity to see, that
the Game Laws, Riot-act, Laws against
Vagrants and Felons, &c. &c. are made
chiefly for the sccurity of the rich against the
depredations of the poor. But what security
have the poor against the oppression and
extortion of the rich? Certainly none at all.
As every comfort of life is derived from land,
and as the rich are the proprietors thereof, it
may in some sense be said, that they hold the
issues of life and death; and, whilst they can,
uninterruptedly, raise their rents without
Fimitation or restraint, they have an alarming
and unbounded power over, not only the
happiness, but even the lives of the great
mass of the people—the poor /

any judicious person would call such a power

when exercised, could ruin none, but bless
tnillions! If it would be cruel to make a
statesman of twenty thousand pounds per
annum, live a year or two upon ten thousand;
how much more remorseless is it, to make
the Spitalfield and Norwich weavers, as well
as some hundred thousands more, live upon
nothing—or, what is little better, upon cha-

other hand, widows, orphans, and others are
weeping, and often dying for want of bread !

What can be more odious in the sight of

“ A FRIEND TO THE POOR,

“ Stockport, Jan. 5, 1794.”

Mr. Law.—I think you say you

Ayes

on the 2nd of May ?—I was, if that was the
day the dinner was had. ;

Were you admitted by any ticket ?—I was.

Who fumished you with that ticket ?—The
preceding evening, between the hours of nine
and ten, Mr. Hardy came to my house, and
brought me a ticket; I think 7s. 6d. marked
enit. I put my hand in my pocket thinking
I was to pay, he said no, there is nothing to
pay for this ticket. .

By whom did you understand those tickets
were given?—I had no conversation with
him upon that subject at all.

Chief Justice Eyre—At what time
did he bring it to you ?—Between the hours
of nine and ten o'clock.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Where?—In
Crown-court, Covent-garden.

Mr. Law.—This was a meeting of the
Constitutional Society ?—I understood it to
be a meeting of the Constitutional Society
with a certain number of the London Corres-
ponding Society, who were invited to that
dinner, and Mr. Hardy brought me a ticket
unknown and unexpected.

Did you go as a member of the Corres-
ponding Society ?—I did.

Do you kuow what number of those tickets
were delivered out for the Corresponding
Society ?~-I think, if. I may presume to

Do you know what number of the Corres-
ponding Society there were there that were
net members of the Constitutional Society P—
I think I may say twenty.

Do you recollect before dinner any news
coming of any particular public event, and
what’ was said in the society upon that ?—
There was some news of some public event.

Was it good or bad news to this country ?—
I understood it to be very bad news.

In the Constitutional Society, and in this
assembly, consisting of members of both
societies, was there any joy shown, or other-
wise?—There seemed universal satisfaction,
and it was carried about the room seemingly
with great eagerness.

Was there any song sung that you recollect
by the uame of the Free Constitution?—It
was delivered to me before dinner in a room
adjoining the dinner-room, by a person who
deliv them round to all the people there,
as far as they could go, I believe.

Did you see any papers of apy sort laid
upon the plates in the room?—I recollect
now there was a paper on the plates.

Was it of the same sort with the one you
have stated to have been delivered in the
outer room ?—I cannot say.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Have you got it?
—I have not.

Mr. Law.--You cannot say whether the
Paper laid on the plate was the same as the
song, or not?---I cannot.

ho was in the chair at that dinner ?—I
anderstood Mr. Horne‘ Tooke~-No, I believe
a Mr. Wharton, and even in that I do not


know that I am correct, but I think so, Mr.
Wharton—— :

Was Mr. Horne Tooke there ?~-He was.

Do you know lord Daer?---I do.

Mention the names of any persons youi
particularly remember to have been present ?.
-—Mr. Horne Tooke, Mr. Wharton, a gentle-
man whom [I saw in court just now, of the
name of ‘Birchall, Mr. Sharp, whom I have
known many years, an engraver; there were
several members of the London Corresponding
Society. f

Do you know Mr. Frost?---Yes; he was:

there, and he sat close to Mr. Tooke. ,
" Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—-Were those:
members or visitors ?---I cannot undertake to
say, I did not belong to the Constitutional
Society.

Mr. Law.—Was Mr. Hardy there ?—Mr..
Hardy was there.

Do you know Thelwall ?--He was there.

Richter ?-—Yes.

Lovett ?--He was there.

Was Moore there ?—-Yes.

Pearce ?-—Yes.

Was Jones there ?—-Yes. ’

He was a member of the London Cortes.
ponding Society I believe ?—There are several .
Jones’s.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---Does much tunt
upon the names? ‘

Mr. Law.—No.—What songs were sung,
do you recollect? do you know a song by the
name of Ca tra ?—That was not sung as I
recolleet, but the moment the company got
into the room, the music struck up Ca ira.

Before dinner are you speaking of —E
think all the time we were at dinner; I think
it Played Ca Ira almost from beginning to
end; it was encored time after time. '

Do you recollect the music of any other
song that was played ?~-Yes, the Marsellois
march—the Carmagnol.

Did the company seem to be pleased with
the music, did 1t meet with any applause ?-—E
never heard such an universal din of appro-
bation in the course of my life; it was nothing
but a scene of clamour, for I do believe most
people’s hands smarted, and their ears ached,

Do you recollect any particular toast drank
after dunes ?-I do not. .

‘Do you recollect none of the toasts ?--I
cannot charge my memory. ,

Do you recollect any particular address that
was made to the company then present, by
Mr. Horne Tooke?-—That I do.

State, as faras you can, the words, if not
the words, the substance of that address ?—I
will; some time after dinner Mr. Horne
Tooke got up, and silence was called, and he _

refaced his address by an observation that,
f believe, one out of fifty in that room might
be considered as a government spy, and to
them he wished particularly to address
himself; and, in consequence of that address,
I must confess I did attend; in consequence
of his addressing himself to goyernment

spies, I certainly did attend to what he said;
for my idea of a spy and informer may differ
particularly in a business of this nature.

To the best of your recollection, what was
it Mr. Horne Tooke delivered in that address?
—~He begged the company to take notice,
that fhe was not in a state of inebriation; for
having something to say to the company, he
had taken care to refrain from his glass; and
for fear of being mistaken, and being taken
tp be in a state of intoxication, he begged
every body present to take particular notice
of what he said; he called the parliament a
scoundrel sink of corruption; he called the
opposition in parliament a scoundrel sink of
opposition ; he said, that there was a junction
between those two scoundrel ies, formed
for the purpose of destroying the rights and
Liberties of the country; he began to speak
about the hereditary nobility; he asked, if
that skip-jack, Jenkinson, could be considered
as one of the hereditary nobility of the coun-
try; and I think, if my memory is right, that
he paid the same compliment to the House
of Lords that he did to the House of
Commons.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Do not speak
about compliment.—W hat did he say ?—That
there was a junction between the ministerial

, and the opposition in the House of

8.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Do you mean
that he said the same thing of the House of
Lords as of the House of Commons?—Yes;
he said it was in order to amuse, or abuse,
(he used one of these words, I am not sure
which word) that poor man, the king.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—What was in
order to amuse?—The junction between the
two parties.

Mr. Lew»—Was ay
him ?-I do not recol:
likewise, that the junction of the opposition
in parliament with the aristocratic party in
the House of Commens, was likewise meant
to abuse and deceive the people of this coun-
try. The junction of parties in the House
of Gommons, to abuse the people of this
country. wy

Did be mention any thing farther respecting
the king ?—I cannot say.

Did he state what was the ebject of his ad-
dress, or of his measures ?—I do not recollect.
wae, fers this agarets of bis i recent _

ith applause,-—wi t applause.

Was any song sung oie tune of God save
the King ?—-There was. :

De you recollect Mr. Horne Tooke’s saying
any thi ing the song thst had been
sang to that tune?—I cannot recollect.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Was it the song
of God save the King ?—No; a song to the
tune of God save the King.

Mr. Law.—Do you recollect Mr, Tooke’s

: simgmg, or reciting, any lines of a song to
that tuee?—-You have recalled something to
tuy memory that I had forgot—if I am right,

* ‘

thing farther said by

lect; yes, I think he said | Ni


Mr. Horne Tooke sung that song; or he sung
an additional verse, which he said had been

‘| forgot.

hat did he supply?---I do not recollect
the words.

What was the name of that song? you said
that a song, intituled the Free Constitution,
was delivered to the members before dinner?
—Yes, and I do not know whether there was
Not one put upon each plate; if it was not
that, it was something else; Mr. Horne Tooke
sung that song. :

Do you recollect the first line of the song
that was sung to the tune of God save the
King?—I do not.

Mr. John Groves cross-examined by Mr. Gibls.

Pray what are you?—I have followed the
business of conveyancing for these twenty-
two, or twenty-three years. .

Then you are a lawyer ?—If you call that a
lawyer.

Is conveyancing the only branch. of the
profession that you have followed ?

Groves.—As an attorney do you mean?

Mr. Gibbs.—Are you an attorney ?—I never
brought or defended an action, in my life, as
an attorney.

You may tell me whether you are an attor-
ney or not?--I am not.

Are you a solicitor.

Groves.—In Chancery ?

Mr. Gibbs.—No,I did not mean in Chan-
cery, you have been long enough in the law to
know the meaning: of the word solicitor ;—
are you a solicitor of any sort?—Yes.

Where ?---f have been here.

Why then, you are solicitor at the Old Bai-
ley ?-~Yes.

Could not you have said so at once; you
understood perfectly well what I meant?—

(0.

When I asked if you were a solicitor, and
you asked if I meant in Chancery, I told you
T did not mean in Chancery ?—I thought you
meant a solicitor in Chancery.

And you really did not know the meaning
of my question?—I did not know.

You had not the least idea that I meant to
ask, if you had been an Old Bailey solicitor?
It ne net occur to me. .

Tt did not occur to you, upon my ag

ou the question, that you had been an Ol
Bailey solicitor ?---I did not say that; but I
gave you what I thought an immediate ane
swer. I really did not know the term as ap
plied to me as a solicitor.

You really did not know but that I means
to ask you whether you were a solicitor in
Chancery ?-—-What was the first time that you
wereat any of those meetings? —On the
of January. —~ - ,

How came you to go then?—-I was sent by
a gentleman. .

y whom ? .

Groves.—I am asked, wy lord, by whom; if
it is proper I will tell,


Mr. Gibbs.---Ifit be improper I will not ask | ings but in the character of a spy ?-~As you

it

Groves.—If it isa fair question I will an-
swer it directly.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—There can be no
imputation upon you for answering the ques-
tion ;---if you decline answering, that is ano-
ther thing ; it exposes you to no difficulties, or
penalty, or any thing of that sort.—-None; it
is only a point of delicacy. I am ready to
give an answer, I have not the least objec-
tion on my part.

Mr. Law.---My lord, I take it that the chan-
nels for information must be protected.

Mr. Attorney-Gencral.---The court of ex-
chequer never would permit that question to
be asked.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---Upon a general
principle I do not know whether it ought to

e answered.

Groves.—It was a person high in office un-
der his majesty; but permit me to add, I
was not desired by that gentleman to conceal
his name.

. git Gibbs.—Then where is the delicacy of
at

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---He has said
what is proper and material for your purpose :
that is, that he went there, being employed
for the purpose of collecting information, with
a view to the disclosure of it. '

Mr. Gibbs.—-I will not press the question
farther than your lordship thinks I ought---
T leave it to the discretion of the Court if it
is thought not proper.

_ Lord Chief Justice Eyre—I do not think it
is proper.

Mr. Gibbs-—-Then you were desired by a

rson, high in office, to go to this place ;—

ow arose your connexion with that gentle-
man ?~-My connexion with that gentleman
has been for these ten years ; that is so far as
having the honour of being personally known
to him.

What sort of connexion had you with him? |

Lord Chief Justice Eyre,---It is hardly pro-
ie that the history of a connexion of that

ind should be disclosed here.

Groces.---That_ gentleman would not em-

loy me in any thing dishonourable, nor would
accept it.

Mr. Gibbs.---I dare say you would not.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---You find he went
on purpose togive information of what passed ;
that is the only fact that is material for
the prisoner; the rest is private intercourse,
which may involve in it the consideration of
a thousand other things, which may be mate-
rial to the government ofthe country. I think
it not proper to be disclosed here, itis not ne-
cessary to the cause.

Groves.-—I have had the honour of his confi-
dence ever since I have known him,

Mr. Gibbs.—Then trusting in you, he sent
you to the Globe-tavern on the 20th of Ja-
nuary, 1794 ?---Certainly.

Then you never were at any of those meet-


call it so, I will take it so.

Mr. Gibbs.---If you were not there as a spy,
take any title vou choose for yourself, and I
will give you that.

Mr. Laz:.---He did not state any title.

Mr, Gibbs.---I did not desire you to take
any title in the sense that gentleman is using
the term ; you object to the term spy, as I
called you, and I bid you take any other naine.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---There should be
no name given to a witness on his examina-
tion: he states what he went for, and in mak-
ing observations on the evidence, you may
give it any appellation you please. You re-
collect I made the observation before, when
Mr. Erskine did the same thing.

Mr. Gibbs.-~I really did not feel that I was
going atall out of the way in the cross-exami-
nation of a witness, in walling him by a name
which suits his character, though he does not
like it.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Go on.

Mr. Gibbs.—-You went then (not to call you
a spy) to these meetings in the character of a
person who had nootherreason for going there,
than that of picking up what information
you could, and carrying it again to those em-
ployers, in whose conhilesiee you were ?---Cer-
tainly.

Then I must express your employment hy
that periphrasis. You said there was a greut
assembly there ?—-There was.

There wasa considerable meeting you said,
and universal suffrage and annual parlia-
ments were talked of ?

Pt —Which meeting do you speak
of?

Mr. Gibbs.—-I am speaking of the meeting
to which you first went —There was a very
large meeting, so much so that the floor broke
down.

You have been giving an account of some
conversation that passed there; cannot you
recollect who the persons were that had that
conversation?—Noy, I do not know; there was
an universal conversation.

You going there for the purpose of collect-
ing evidence against individuals, and coming
now to give evidence againstan individual, vou
thought it not material to observe who the
people were who then used this language—
You, a gentleman used to practise at the Old
Bailey, and meaning to give evidence after-
wards against those persons, did not think it
material to learn by whom these cunversa-
tions were held?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.--Mr. Gibbs, Iam
sorry to interrupt you, but your cuestions
ought not to be accomp:nied with those sort
of comments: they are the proper sulyects of
observation when the defence is made. The
business of a cross-examination is to ask to all
sorts of acts, to probe a wilness as closely as
you can ; but it is not the object of a cross-ex-
amination, to introduce that kind of periphra-
sis as you have just done.

sc

Mr. Gibbs—Send to Mr. Erskine, he is in
the parlour.

[Mr. Erskine immediately came into court.]

Mr. Erskine.—Will your lordship give me
Jeave to say, it is the universal practice of the
Court of King’s-bench, the first criminal court
in this country, in which I have had the ho-
nour to practise for seventeen years---We are
certainly permitted to go as far as this. I
agree with your lordship in what you just now
said (and it will be of no consequence whether
I did or no, because your lordship must give
the rule) but what I take my learned friend to
have said to the witness, is this: you, sir, not
Meaning itas an insult tothe witness, but you,
sir, as a practiser at the Old Bailey, must
know the necessity, if you go to any place to
get evidence, of having proper materials for
that evidence ; how do you account for not
having done that? Ina cross-examination,
counsel are not called upon to be so exact as in
an original examination---You are permitted
to lead a witness.

Mr. Guibbs.-1 desired Mr. Erskine to be
sent for into court, as I wished to have the
testimony of a gentleman who has practised
in that court more than any man now present,
that I was not departing from the practice
which has obtained there---My end is now
answered in desiring Mr. Erskine to come
into court.

Mr. Erskine.—I can appeal to one of the
learned judges now upon the bench. I re-
meniber that when Mr. Garrow first came to
the situation, which undoubtedly he fills with
a great deal of ability, I ohjected to a question
he put on a cross-examination, and when it
turncd out that it was upon cross-examination,
the Jaugh was turned against me, and I had
nothing to say.

Mr. Justice Buller.—Undoubtedly the prac-
tice has increased much within my memory :
what Mr. Erskine alludes-to now has been
universally the practice; that when you are
upon a cross-cxamination, you are permitted

to lead a witness more than you can on an ori- !

inal examination ; but he so good as recol-
ect the mode in which the lord chief justice
put it yesterday, and Ido notthink in Guildhall,
orany where else, you cver departed from that.
You may Icad a witness upon a cross-exami-
nation to bring him directly to the point as to
the answer; but not to go the length as was
attempted yesterday, of putting the very words
into a witness’s mouth, which he was to echo
back again.*

Mr. Erskine.---Having done that yesterday,
I immediately bowed to the admonition I
received from my Lord Chief Justice.

Lord Chief Justicé Eyre.---I should be ex-
tremely sorry if it should be supposed that I
mean to make an observation that seemed to
press personally upon either of the learned




counsel who are now for the defendant, and
particularly on the gentleman who is now
cross-examining this witness, and more parti-
cularly if it were supposed I was capable of
doing that in the absence of the other coun-
sel; I hope that will never be imagined of me.

With regard to the point, I think itis so
clear that the questions that are put are not to
be loaded with all the observations that arise
upon all the previous parts of the case, they
tend so to distract the attention of every bods,
they load us in point of time so much, and
that that is not the time for observation upon
the character and situation of a witness is s6
apparent, that as a rule of evidence it ought
never to be departed trom ; but it is certainly
true that it dues slide into examinations, and
that it is very often not taken notice of, and it
saves more time frequently to let it pass than
to take notice of it; but there is a rule to
which all those sort of things, if once an ap-
peal is made to the Court, ought to be brought,
and my judgment is, that after you have got
the particular facts upon which that sort of
observation is founded, the examination ought
to preed to the other facts upon the case,
and the observations upon those furmer facts
ought to make part of the defence. :

Mr. Gibbs—My reason for sending for Mr.
Erskine was because I knew it had been the
practice, and I think I have observed it m
the course of this cause on the other side.
What Mr. Justice Buller has said, that it isa
Practice that has gene on toa greater length
than it ought, I hope, will be an excuse tor
me, because I am more inexperienced in the
profession than Mr. Erskine or Mr. Garrow.
If that mode of examination prevails on one
side, especially against a defendant——

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I will never suffer
it to prevail on either side; but as far asf
would indulge it, it should be on the part of s
defendant.

Mr. Gibbs.—-Your lordship does not su
| I trust, than I sent for Mr. Erskine with any
other view than I have mentioned, I coafess
I feel myself sensibly mortified. .

Lord Chief justice Eyre.--I am extremely
sorry for it, I never wished to mortify you.

Nr. Gibbs—I think you told me thet you
were a gentleman who practised at the Ud
Bailey, 3 you now practise here, or have you
lett off that practice ?~-1 have not left it off.

You now practise at the Old Bailey?—f
have not for some time.

How happens that ?---Not this six months.

Your reason for not having practised is,
that no business has been brought to you, I
presume ?-—Certainly, you are right there.

Did you or not think it necessary, at
Meeting, to attend to the particular persoms
from whom the conversation that you are
now stating, proceeded ?---At that time I was
a total stranger almost to every one in the
room.

You did not endeavour to distinguish what
was said by one man from what was said by
ancther?---I did not in conversation.


You say the language was universal suf-
and anoual parliaments ?—-Yes.
an you tell me who used that language ?
—I cannot, it was the gencral language.

Who used it you cannot tell?—No I cannot.

Tlow many people might there be there ?—
as many as the room could contain, and it
was a large room; I should suppose if I said
four hundred people, I should speak within
bounds.

You cannot recollect any one particular per-
son who held this language you have been
speakiug of ?—I cannot: we were in two
rooms there; the first room we were in
broke down, which occasioned us to go up
stairs.

You were afterwards at Chalk-farm, I
think you say ?-—I was.

Tbere you went under the same employ-
ment, and for the same person ?---Exactly so.

You seem to have fixed yourselfa good deal
upon Mr. Thelwall ?—No, Mr. Thelwall fixed
himself upog me,

It was involuntary then?—Quite so, for
st that time I hardly knew Mr. Thelwall.

You would rather have declined it !—-No, I
did not say that; that is going too far; he
and I were standing at the door, in Store-
street, together, when there were not above
ten or a dozen people there, and then the
paper being stuck up, that the meeting would
- held at Chalk Farm, he said, “ come

eng.”

Was that the first time you had conversed
with him?—I had conversed with him se.
veral times.

Did he know who you were ?~-I do not
believe he did.

He had no previous knowledge of you ?---
He had none of me, nor I of him.

Had ‘ae any introduction to him ?—None.

You had yo previous knowledge of him, nor
he of you, no introduction to him, no common
friend who told each that he might trust the
other ?--No, I do not recollect that ever such
§ conversation passed between me and any
man in the world.

But all this that he said to you was volun-
tary?—What passed between him and me
was in going to Chalk-farm, which was the
first time in my life I ever spoke to him; it
was voluntary. .

I think you say that at Chalk-farm there
was aclamour that spies were there ?-—Cer-

y. ,
And Mr. Thelwall was for admitting them
?..-He was, and desired them to hear;

snd, I believe, I may add something further,

now you have brought it tg my, recollection :

hesaid,it would give the minister the power of

te ging of their proceedings and their num-
13,

- You said so before. I believe you yourself
made this cry against spies, did not you? you
said you thought there were spies

.Smong them?—O yes! I did say that, and
thought myself very justifiable in so doing.


Yes, yes, that was a scheme you had learned
in your practice certainly; you were the person
then who suggested that there were spics
from the Treasury there ?—No, I was not;
there was a person present, was asked if
I knew him; I said, yes, I did.

Did you say you knew him to be a spy?-—~
I was asked who he was, and what he was, and
I said, I did think he was a person employed
by government.

Who was he?—IIis name was Walsh,

And you seeing Mr. Walsh there, said, you
thought he was a person employed by govern-
iment?—I was applied to by several to know
whether it was not Mr. Walsh; I said, it was,
and that I believed he had some employment
about government; and I believed Mr.
Walsh did not wish to conceal it, for upon
his buttons there was, I believe, the King
and Constitution, so that he did not wish to
conceal it.

Because Mr. Walsh came there with King
and Constitution upon his buttons, you chose
to say that you thought he was a spy, was
that so?—That was not the reason, because
he had the King and Constitution upon his
buttons, for that might have been put on.

Well, seeing him there with King and Con-
stitution on his buttons, you chose to say
that you thought he was a spy from the
‘Treasury ?—No.

Then do tell me how the fact is?—The fact
is, I was applied to by two or three to know
ifI knew Mr. Walsh, I said yes, and he was
pointed out to me; I said that is Mr. Walsh,
certainly; somebody made answer, who I
cannot say, he is just come from Ireland,
where he has becn upon soine government.
business; I was asked if I knew any thing of
his being employed by government, I said
immediately, I do believe he is.

Did not you me hiey believed he was a spy?
—I do not think I did

Will you swear you did not say, that you
believed he was a spy?—By my saying that I
believed he was employed by government, [
meant to say, that he was a spy.

Then you do consider that the term spy, is
to be applied to those employed by govern-
ment?—If you take it by implication that a,
man employed by government Isa spy, it is so.

No; itis your own interpretation of the
words ?—Then you have it that way, I confess
it so far.

Then you did say you thought he was a
spy ?—Yes, so far as giving information.

tt wasafter that, that Mr. Thelwall said he
was for admitting all spies ?—Certainly, Mr.
Thelwall did say so. . ;

This was a very large mceting, was not it?
—It was large. .

Had you no apprehension for your friend,
Mr. Walsh, saying, you thought he was a spy,
at such a mecting ?—Ie is no friend of mine.

He was nota man, I suppose, whom you
wished to have torn to picccs ?—No, nor any
man in the world.

«

Were not you a little apprehensive of hold-
ing him out asa spy, a man youknew nothing

ot?—No; Iwas for admitting all spies too, |

and to let them remain there unmolested.

But though you might be for letting spies,
that were there, continue, I want to know why
you pointed out a particular man as a spy ?—
I did not pvint out a particular man, I was
applied toif I knew him, and I was taken to
one end of the garden to look at him, and I
said that is Mr. Walsh, certainly.

Did not you say you believed he was em-
ployed by government ?—I did.

Employed by government to be there P—I
did not say that.

But was not that your meaning?—I did
mean that.

Then why are you fencing with me?—I
am not fencing.

You represented him to be a man sent there
by government, in the same way as yourself?
—-Yes,

What induced you to point out this man?
~-I was desired to point him out.

Did you believe him tobe so ?-~I did.

I want to know whether you, going there,
as what you call yourself, a spy, how you
came to point out to the people, that were
there, another person whom you also believed
to be a spy?---There was good reason for that,
because, it I had not said he was sent there
as aspy, I should have been suspected myself:
the fact was too notorious to be denied, and if
Mr. Walsh was here he would not deny it.

With King and Constitution upon his
buttons ?-~I think there was at that time.

What number of people do you think were
there at this time ?-—-I should think between
two and three thousand; there was a vast
number, I believe, that were there out of
curiosity, but, as far as I am able to judge,
there were not above eight or nine hundred of
the London Corresponding Society there.

You say, that sitting down to eat some
bread and cheese, there was something that
you called little instruments taken out, and it
turned out that these were French knives ?---
Yes, in the shape of French knives, made in
this country I presume, as many of them are,

I know they are very common things ?—-
As common as any thing certainly, and I be-
licve a great many people use them for safety
to their hands.

You went to Mr, Green’s in Orange-street,
you say ?~-Yes,

He told you he had sold two or three hun-
dred of these, but told you to speak very low as
the parlour-door was open, and his wife was
a damned Aristocrat ?---Ile certainly used
those words. .

You are positive to those particular words,
that he said his wife was a damned Aris-
tocrat P---I am, and we both of us laughed.

What did you laugh at?—At the lady’s
being an Aristocrat.

I think you told me you were at the dinner
on ie 2d of May, at the Crown and Anchor?
—165.


How many people might there be there?--
TI should think there must be five hundred in
all.

You went there in the same character, I
suppose ?-—Assuredly.

You say there was some piece of news
brought---a newspaper brought in ?---I do not
know whether a newspaper was brought in,
but there were accounts brought in that some
of the Allied Powers had received a very
great check.

You do not know whether there was any
newspaper brought in?—I do not; I must
add this, that I was very much surprised
indeed when I went into the Constitutional
Society---I there saw a number of most
respectable gentlemen.

Then at this meeting that you are speaking
of, there were a number of very respectable
gentlemen ?---Indeed there were. .

How did you get there?—-I have told you
by a ticket Mr. Hardy brought to me; I
offered to pay for it, he said they were not to
be paid for.

What number did this meeting consist of?
—-I dare say near five hundred; [ think three
hundred and fifty or four hundred sat down to
dinner.

You are not sure, I think you say, who was
in the chair ?——I am not, but if I may a
sume to think upon the subject, it was Mr.
Wharton,

You must not presume to think ?—Then I
am not certain, and I will give you the reason;
we went into the room, and there was a little
bustle, and who was put into the chair I
cannot say, butI consider Mr. Wharton to
be inthe chair; but whether it was him or
Mr. Horne Tooke, I cannot tell.

Whichever it was, I suppose he sat at the
head of the table?—-There was a row all
along, and they sat at the head of the table.

Then I think you say Mr. Tooke madea
speech, in which he reflected upon the House
of Commons ?—Yes.

. You say he called the House of Commons a
sink of corruption ?—He called the House of
Commons a scoundrel sink of corruption.

He spoke of there being a junction between
the two parties ?—He called them a scoundrel
opposition,

I do not want you to repeat any offensive
expressions that he used against individuals,
but I think in speaking against the hereditary
nobility, he spoke generally of a particular
person ?—He did, and he spoke of more than

one.

I believe he spoke highly of the hereditary
nobility of the country ?—He did. .

He spoke highly of the hereditary nobility
of the country as contra-distinguished from
adventurers?—Most assuredly, he paid the
hereditary nobility of the country every com-
pliment that'a man could pay. .

I believe he observed, likewise, that this
hereditary nobility, of whom he spoke so
high, had lost their influence in the state, by


the introduction of adventurers?—I do not
know that the word adventurers was made
use of.

By the introduction of those then who were
not the hereditary nobility? —The new
nobility.

He had before been declaiming against the
House of Commons, certainly, using an im-
Proper expression, however, calling them a
sink of corruption ?—Yes.

Did he not say, likewise, that those new
nobility were introduced into the House of
Lords by means of those people whose conduct
he was finding fault with in the House of
Commons ?-—I think his sense was the same ;
T have no hesitation to say that his sense was
the same.

Did he not also speak highly of the office
of the King in the Constitution ?-.-I am very
clear he did, because he said, that the new-
made peers, or those lately introduced into
the House of Lords, either had combined, or
were combining for the purpose of amusing
that poor man, the king.

Did he not mention it as matter of com-
plaint, that the king had lost his due weight
In the constitution, by means of this corrup-
tion that he had been complaining of before ?
-—I understood him completely so; I do not
know one word that Mr. Horne Tooke said
disrespectful to his majesty.

Did he hold out any thing as matter of
complaint in the now existing constitution,
except that there was a sort of people intro-
duced into the House of Commons whom he
disapproved of; and by their means likewise
asort of persons introduced into the House of
Peers, whom he disapproved of; and that
they, acting together, restrained the due power
of the crown ?---I believe that was the object
of all his conversation.

Mr. John Gurnell called again.

Where did you find that paper?—In Mr.
Hardy’s house.

was the Society’s Resolutions, and Address to
the public at large.
’ Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—-What date has
that address ?.--I do not immediately recol-
fect; but if one was handed to me, I could
recognise it; but I think it is in March,
1792,

Is this one of the papers?-—-It isa larger
pamphlet than that.

Upon receiving that paper, did you give any
intimation of any kind to the master of the
house?---Yes; I told him I believed it was a

eighty people. :

as the prisoner at the bar one of them?
--Yes. we

In what character did the prisoner appear
there ?-—As secretary, I understood.

Who were the delegates at that meeting ?—
Being a young member at that time, I had
not made myself informed: of the names of
the delegates, nor the-oumber of the divisions.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Was this a

of the division, No. 2.

Mr. Bower.—Did Mr. Hardy, while you

passed that night?—-Yes; the delegates had
received letters from the Manchester and
Sheffield Societies, approving of the Londap
Corresponding Society’s Address to the
French Convention---Reported that two thou-
sand and upwards had signed it at Nor-
wich—-The Ctown and Anchor approve of it,
but would send one of their own ; thinking
the more addresses that were sent to the Con-
vention the better. .

Who were present besides the prisoner ?—
A great many.

Who communicated the letter from the
Manchester society ?---The mode of conducting

the divisions is thus: the delegate of the
division attends the business that has been
transacted at the committee of delegates, and
he makesa report of what letters and what re-
solutions were brought forward and agreed to.

That was the mode of doing the business?
—Yes. .

Was there any thing more passed at that

made any memorandum of.

Do you recollect any thing more, or do you
not?—That is all I recollect at that meeting.

Who made that report that you have been
speaking of at the last meeting ?—I cannot
charge my recollection who it was, and there-
fore I would not speak. The next meeting
was of the division, No. 12, at the Crown, in
Newgatc-street, on the 31st of October.

Who was present at that meeting ?—Mr.
Hardy was not present.

What was done at that meeting ?—At that
meeting the address to the French Convention
was reported by the delegate that was brought
forward on the 27th of September at the
Unicorn.

Did any thing more pass there?—I have
made a remark of nothing more than that; 7
fancy there was nothing of any consequence.
The next meeting was at the Rainbow, in
Fleet-street, on the 2nd of November.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—What division
was that ?—I have not got the number of the
division, and I do not immediately recollect it.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—It was not your
own division, No. 12?—No, number 12 was
the division I entered into; it was not that,
but another division; tothe best of my recol-
lection it was No. 11.

Mr. Bower.—Did any thing material pass
at that meeting ?—The delegate reported, that
the company at Stockport had wrote to Shef-
field of their approbation of the different
meetings. The editor of the Sheffield paper
wrote to the delegates, that it would be a
good plan to send London delegates down
to teach the farmers politics. A letter from a
Meeting just formed at Nottingham, addressed
to the delegates—I am inclined to think that
letter was not read. The next report was,
that there were six honorary members ad-
mitted at the Crown and Anchor.

Admitted to the Constitutional Society, do
you mean ?—Yes; that is the whole of that
Meeting. The next, division, No. 12, at the

Crown, Newgate-street, November the 14th.

Mr. Bower.—I will prove by the paper in
my hand, that Mr. Hardy was the delegate of
division, No. 2; because your lordships will
have a goud deal of evidence of what passed

in the division of which he was a delegate.

Lord Chief Justice Hyre—You said you
did not know who was the delegate ?—I will

not take upon myself to be certain, but believe
Ishould be right if I said that Mr. Hardy was
delegate at that time, for that division.


[Mr. Lauzun called again.]

Mr. Bower.—Did you find that ever sow
ing it to the witness] among Mr. Hardy’s
papers ?--I found it in Mr. Hardy’s house,

Alerunder Grant.---I believe that is Mr,
Hardy’s hand-writing.

[It was read.]

« London Corresponding Society, at the Uni-
corn, Covent-Garden, Monday, October
1, 1792.

“ Resolved, That Thomas Hardy, division
No. 2. be appointed our delegate to the stand-
ing committee of the several divisions, and to
continue in office for three months.

(Signed) “ Atexanvrer Lownie, chairman.”

Indorsed, “ Division No. 2, delegate,

: Thomas Hardy.
“ Number of members, 120.”

Mr. Bower, to Lynam.—Whether the per-
son who made the report at that meeting, on
the 29th of October, at the Unicorn, was the
delegate ?—Surely so.

Mr. Bower.—Now go on from where you
left off.

Lynam.—The next meeting was at the
Crown, in Newgute-street, on the 14th of
November.

What passed at that meeting ?—Nothing
material | tanev; I have no minute of any
thing.

Pass on to the next.—I return back again
here to a meeting at the Unicorn, November
12th.

Of division, No. 2. ?—Yes.

What passed at that division?—There was
read a letter, written by Mr. Barlow—his
address to the Convention, very inflammatory,
and there were very loud plaudits at the
reading.

Who made the report that night?—The
delegate reports, the reportis always made by
the delegate. .

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Was thata letter
addressed to the division, or communicated
by the delegate as coming trom the committee

[766

| of delegates ?—As coming from the committee

of delegates, and it was Barlow’s Letter ad-
dressed to the Convention of France. The
next is a report by somebody to the meeting,
that the London Corresponding Society in
London, in number, was six thousand; that
the division, No. 14, meeting at Spitalfields,
was increased, and would soon be equal in
number to all the rest of the divisiuns of the
society. The first mecting of the London
Corresponding Society, I was informed, was
at Mr. Robert Boyd’s, No. 11, Exeter-street,
and that he had the first resolutions of the
socicty ; I was shown one, dated the 2nd uf
of EAinbureh he does not approve of the
Address to the Convention, but was framing a
paper to inform the public on politics, and

would serid one svon to the society.

How was that letter conveyed ; was that to
the division, No. 2, at the Unicorn?—Yes ;
the London Corresponding Society’s address
received by the National Convention, and
ordered to be published and sent to the
eighty-three departments.

Is that a report of what had been done in
France?—A_ report by the delegate, of their
Address to the National Convention of France
being received, and that by the Convention it
was ordered to be published and sent to the
eighty-three departments in France :—The
society at Sheffield sent up their Address to the
Convention to the delegates, who had for-
warded it; that is the whole at that meeting.

Had sent up their Address to the committee
of delegates?—Yes, and they had forwarded
it to the Convention.

Is that the whole of the minutes you have
of what passed at that time?—It is. The
next mecting was at the Crown, in Newgate-
‘street, No. 21, division No. 12: It was at
this division mentioned, that there was a talk
of a congress to be held in Scotland. The
next thing that was done, was to read judge
Asbhurst’s charge to the grand jury. Re-

rted, that a society at Norwich wanted to

now, if we meant to come into the duke of
Richmond’s plan, or to rip up monarchy ; they
suspected that this was to draw them into
some unguarded expressions, and declined
answering. Reported, that the delegates had
wrote to the society at Sheffield, and at Edin-
burgh. The next is, the branching off of the
new division, from No. 12; the branching off
was on the 21st of November, and this new
division took No. 23, and met at the Ship in
Moorfields, on the 27th of November.

Were you a delegate of the new division, or
did you continuc in the old one?—I was
chosen delegate of this first meeting on the
27th of November; it was recommended to
inform the public that we were not levellers,
and it was recommended to avoid riot or re-
sistance to the laws.

__ Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Were the reasons
for that recommendation stated ?—There was,
at ,the time, but I did not make any memo-
randum of it, but it was on account of the
magistrates interfering with their meetings,

some of the publicans had been threat-
ened to have their licences taken away; in
‘consequence of that, this was a recommenda-
tion of the division.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Was this a re-
commendation to re from the ‘committee of
delegates, reported by your delegate ?—It was
a conversation—it was a recommendation of
the division that it should be carried by me to
the committee of delegates. Reported, that
in Edinburgh, the first characters belonged to
the cause, had formed themselves into a
society, and called themselves a Convention of
Delegates, and it was resolved to subscribe for
the defence of any prosecuted member and
his family.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—You do not


mean a regular repdrt, but that this was con-
versation?—It was conversation. The next
remark that I have got, is—a meeting of de-
legates at the Sun, in Windmill-street, on the
29th of November; it was agreed to change
the house weekly.

Were yon present at a meeting of the dele-
gees that day ?—Yes, there were twenty-two

elegates met.

Wus any paper, or any proposal brought
forward there?—The division, No. 11, had
received twenty visitors {rom Islington; a
society was intended to be formed there—
The sub-committee brought forward their
answer to the Crown and Anchor, but it was
referred back again to that sub-committee.

What Crown and Anchor declaration was
that referred to?—The meeting of delegates
must have had a letter from the Constitu-
tional Society, which must have been read,
and answered before I became a delegate ; so
that what it wasI cannot tell.

Mr. Bower.—When you talk of the Crown
and Anchor, do you mean the Society for
Constitutional Information at the Crown and
Anchor ?—Yes ;—there was one presented by
counsellor Vaughan, a visitor from the Con-
stitutional Socicty; he offering an answer, it
was read and approved with some alterations;
there were some parts of it that were objected
to, and these words were——

Lord Chief Justice Eyre-—Was counsellor
Vaughan present?—Yes; he was a visitor
from the Constitutional Society; the address
that he brought forward was approved with
some alterations, a part of the alteration was
“ die in the cause.”

Putting in or taking out those words ?—
Both.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Did you mean
that you struck out, or added those words ?—
Struck them out;—but, however, there was
something there said in justification of those
words, by something that passed in Crom-
well’s time, about a brewer being made a
colonel—It was agreed that this should be
put in the Sunday’s paper if possible, and five

undred large bills printed and stuck up about
the town, that we are not levellers, and onc to
be sent to each division, —Mr.Vaughan most
strongly recommended good order and _peace-
able conduct.

Mr. Bower.—You say you do not know
what the paper was to which this was an
answer, or where’ it came from ?— I did not
see that; hut this answer, that was read that
night and approved of, was brought forward
by counsellor Vaughan, and these words were
erased out, but were attempted to be justified.

Do you know from what society at the
Crown and Anchor that came ?—The Consti-
tutional Society.

It was an answer to something reccived
before you were a member ?—Yes;—if our
funds were low the Constitutional Society
would print for us. .

Who said that ?—Mr. Vaughan said that;

q

1 it was then reported that many enemies to the
[ society had endeavoured to into the
pent At this meeting it was reported that
five divisions had been scouted, that is pre-
vented meeting at the pent where they usually
, had met.—Maurice Margarot made a motion
to write to Mr. Pitt and the attorney-general,
' that if our meetings were illegal he would
surrender himself';—this was over-ruled, and
it was agreed to support all prosecuted mem-
bers, and recommended to all the divisions. —
Mr. Erskine.—You wrote this down at the
time ?—Yes.
Mr. Bower.—Did you receive that note from
the prisoner Hardy ? [showing a paper to the
witness.j ?~-Yes, I did.

[The paper read.]
“ December 4, 1792.
“Citizen Lynam, you are requested to
meet the Special Committee this evening, at
seven o'clock, at the Nag’s-head, Orange-
_ Street, Leicester-fields.--I am your fellow citi-
. zen, “ Tuomas Harpy.

* Please to inform any of the delegates near
"you that you kuow, but no one else.”

Addressed “ To Mr. Tyas No. 31, Wal-
brook.”

Did you in consequence of this notice goto
the place where that note required you to go?
—I did; but have no memorandum of any
thing that passed.

Have you apy recollection of what passed?
+I have not.

Were you present at a meeting of any of
the divisions, upon the 11th of December?—
¥es: Division No. 23, December the 11th.

At what place ?—I fancy it was at the
Brown- Bear, in Moortields, but I have not got
it down.

What passed at that meeting ?—It was re-
ported at that meeting that the London Cor-

responding Society’s rules were introduced
gmong the soldiers.

Have you read as far as you have taken

minutes of the 11th of December, at the
Brown- Bear, in Moorfields ?—There were no
new members admitted.
. Was any thing material done there?—
It was reported that colonel Dalrymple, of
‘Edinburgh, was determined to have a parlia-
mentary reform; it was reported likewise,
that the Irish were scouted, as we had heen;
that they had applied to the council, who had
decfared their meeting to be legal.

To the council?—Yes.

Was it explained what council ?—The privy
council in Dublin. A motion was then made
that as the finances of the divisions are low,
as they. Seuties pot the Address, the divisions
are recomme: to subscribe. Three mem-
bers of this division declared, at that time,
that they would stick them up about the
town.

‘W hat address was it that they were then
talking about ?—I famcy that must have been



the Address to the Constitutional Society, but
I have not got the memorandum, whether it
was that, or what it was.

Was it the address that was produced by
Mr. Vaughan ?—I rather think it was. There
was a report here, that Baxter, who was
a delegate of the division, No. 16, was
at the meeting at Shoreditch Church, that
he opposed the meeting, and that he was
laid hold of; and that in consequence of that,
seeing he could not resist, he put his hand
into his pocket, and pulled out many of the
society’s addresses, and threw them with
a good deal of exultation among the people
assembled there, and he complained that he
was very ill used, his coat torn, and he struck
several times in the church- yard. i

What meeting was that?—That was at
Shoreditch Church. .

What time are you got tonow ?—The 11th
of December. ,

Do you know what that meeting was for P—
It was a meeting to support the constitution
of the country. ‘

Now come to the 13th of December?—Fhe
next meeting was at Round-coyprt, in the
Strand, on the 13th of December; that was
a meeting ef the delegates.

How many delegates were at that meeting?
—Eighteen.

Was the prisoner there ?—He was there.

What passed at that meeting?—It was
there reported that the magistrates were after
Littlejohn, and that he is now going to Scot-
land. That has nothing at all to do with it,
that is not of any consequence—a Mr. Field
was chosen assistant secretary. A motion

from the division, No. 4, that a letter should
be wrote to the common council of London,
to be wrote bythe secretary, to whom it was
referred. Mr. Ridgeway was to publish Mr.
Margarot’s letter to the secretary of state, and
the receipt from the post-office ; that receipt
from the post-office was to be taken in my
name, and in Mr. Field, and Mr. Bell’s
names.

What letter are you now speaking of ?—
Mr. Margarot’s letter to Mr. Secretary Dun+

das. :

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—What was that
about the receipt from the Post-office?—It
was directed that the letter should be carried
to the post-office by myself, Mr. Field, and
Mr. Bell. oa ,

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—What letter was
to be carried to the post-office ?—Mr. Marga
rot's letter to Mr. Secretary Dundas.

Mr. Bower.—-Were you to take a receipt
there to show you had carried it there?---
Yes; if Mr. Bell had any objection to have
his name in the receipt, the reccipt was ther
to be inthe name of three of the delegates of
the London Corresponding Society. :

Is that a copy of Mr. Margarot’s letter to
Mr. Dundas?—[Showing it to the witness. ]-->
This is the letter. :

_ Lord Chief Justice Eyre.--Where was Mar-

3D

garot at that time ?---He was at this meeting.

Mr. Bower.-~It was put into the General
Post-office, though the party was in London
at the time?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.--Is that a com-
mon thing ?---It was done at the request of
Mr. Margarot, that the society might be sa-
‘tisfied that this letter was sent; and, there-
fore, instead of sending it down to Mr. Se-
cretary Dundas’s office, it was determined to
put it into the General Post-office, and then
there was no doubt but that it would go safe.

[The letter read.]

“ London, 4th December, 1792.
“ No. 10, High-street, Marybone.

“ Sir ;—Honoured with, and happy in the
confidence of a number of my countrymen, I
have their request to transmit officially to his
majesty’s ministers, two addresses jomed in
one, and containing together the reasons why
we have associated for a parliamentary re-
form, and the legal and peaceable methods hy
which we hope to maintain it.

“So sanctioned, I must also inform you
that this letter, and these addresses, equally
speak the sentiments of some thousands of
industrious citizens, in this capital; and of a
far greater number dispersed throughout the
island, there not being a single-corner of it
(Rotten Boroughs excepted) but cries aloud
for reform.

« Contig in the justice of our claim, in
the merits of our peaceable demeanour, and
our ready obedience to all the laws of our
country, we imagine ourselves clear from all
charge or imputation of sedition, rebellion,
conspiracy or treason ;. and that in pursuing
what no one can deny to be our right, we are
entitled to every protection and support of

vernament.—I therefore, in behalf of my
lellow citizens, this day call upon the king's
ministers to protect and uphold us in the pur-
suit of our constitutional rights; and ire,
that in future, our lawful and.well re lated
assemblies, may be no more disturbed or in-
terrupted by the saucy interference of usurped
authority, by men unnamed, working with
threats upon the fears of uninformed publi-
cans, and boasting of szcrer orders and war-
rants—as though Britain was fallen under a
despotic government, and liable to be ruled,
not by laws, but ions, and to be
subservient to ministerial dictates, written on
a drum head, and proclaimed by the mouth
of the cation.

“« Equally known by his activity as by his
knowledge of the ned an honest i irate,
whose spies had well informed him of the na-
ture of our meetings, has acknowledged that
they were peaceable, innocent, and consritu-
Tionat, and further admits the necessity of a
reform :.-—at your hands, sir, I therefore, de-
mand justice and protection for the society
@gainst all ruffians, who, let loose on the
pate have dared, or shall henceforward dare,

the satellites of ancient sanguinary ty-


[772
rants, assume to themselves the double office
of making laws and executingthem. Certain
that such an iniquitous system cannot origi-
nate ina British cabinet, we exclaim, may
perdition light equally upon such vile miscre-
ants, and upon their employers !

“Were we, according to the hackneyed
custom, to recur to precedents, we should say,
that Mr. Pitt, and the duke of Richmond, have
themselves traced out the path which we
now yates that they themselves have as-
serted the rights of Britons, to a fair, equal,
and adequate representation in parliament—
that they, themselves, had invited us to asso-
ciate and discuss our rights; and we might
add, that in so doing, they spoke, they acted
like honest men——they were not then in
office. | ‘ *

“But the Rights of the People being ever
the same, such precedents and such support-
ers are superfluous. However, as things seen
through the medium of power, have a very
different aspect from what they wore when
those worthy gentlemen were on the other
side of the question, it is not altogether im-
probable that severities may be bad recourse
to, to quell that desire for reform which they
themselves have raised.—-Should that be the
case, I beg it as a favour, or rather, peng 5
the foremost rank, claim it as my right,
the attack may commence upon me. When-
ever extraordinary measures may be adopted,
I earnestly wish to be the first of the society
in feeling the effects of them, and shall deem
it not a proud, but an honourable Gay, in
which I shall be called upon to plead the
cause of my fellow citizens against oppres-
sion.

“ Claiming protection, I have a right to
your answer, either to refuse or to it it—in
either case it shall be made public-—as shall
also “ed silence, should you not attend to
this letter, expressing the request of many
thousand citizens. Our country shall then
judge us both.-—I am, sir, your very humble
serv:

with the societies formed at Ipswich and at
Woodbridge, the answer was, no. Mr. Mar-
tin recommended not to publish any thing,
the times won't do; he says that you cannot
oppose the treasury. Then Baxter brought
forward a motion from his division, No. 16,
for the delegates to consult and to determine

parliamentary reform—agreed that Margarot
-do draw it up against the next meeting. There
came forward a petition from William Carter,
who was employed to stick those bills‘up,
that he had lost a place of twelve shillings a
week. :

Doany directions appear to be given in
sepnsesucnce of that ?—He says he was con-
fined three days and two nights, but Martin
“says only one day. .

Mr. Bower.—-You have omitted there some-
thing respecting Carter, look back to your
minute of the 20th of December?~-No, I have
not—it was referred for a month. Martin
‘was employed for the defence of William Car.
‘ter, and there was a subscription then made
for that defence; at that time division, No.
12, subscribed a guinea and a half; No. 18,
fifteen shillings ; No. 11, five shillings. There
‘as an intimation at that time that Ridgeway
would publish any thing the society should
send to him---he mentioned the duke of Rich-
mond’s letter, and said that he would print
that or any thing they sent.

Information from whom ?—Some one of the
delegates. Baxter’s business was brought

forward again; Martin informed him that

his recognizance was not entered at Hick’s
Hall; he was ordered to withdraw his recog-
nizance himself, and then he could not
held himself again to bail in that action, but
there was not any thing done in that ; it was
then said that Mr. Fox had

more honest than others, and think he has
been forced to avow himself so strongly in the
House, and it is necessary to have a lies

Necessary to have a head for what ?—To
the plan that was carrying on—it alluded to
the whole.

Mr. Erskine.—Have you any note of that

last observation—who made the last observa-
tion?—Margarot. Gay, a printer, belongs to
the society, but he denies it; he em loyed
William Carter to stick up the large bills in
the morning, instead of the evening, which
was thereason why he was taken up---this was
reported at that time by Martin. The next is
No. 31, Compton-street, 27th of December, a
meeting of delegates.

Was the prisoner present?—-He was pre-
sent. It was then recommended that each

delegate take the opinion of each division of

the propriety of admitting soldiers, and upon
what terms. 3

One of the Jury.—Was this a meeting of

delegates ?—Yes—The next meeting was a
meeting of delegates, No, 31, Compton- street,
on the 3d of January, 1793: Margarot, chose
president; Hardy, secretary; Field, sub-se-
cretary.

Was any thing done there ?---It was
proposed that each member should pay a
penny each night if he introduced a visitor, to
pay at the division he attends, and then to be
discharged, paying at his own division. Mr
Durant, a stranger, acquainted us. of Thom-
g0n's distress,


‘one as far as we

Who was Thomson ?—A mah that lived by

Coventry-street, I forget the name of the
pce: He was go oto Franc thet tine

think. .
His distress upon what occasion ?—-The

wife’s distress, in uence of his being
obliged to leave London, olay one belonging
to this society, a very violent man, and he was

therefore sought after; it was represented

that the rent was not paid, and that she was
quite distressed with three children, Thomsoa

—Mr..Harvey, an attorney of the

‘emple,
her friend-—sixteen delegates met, and col.
lected in the whole 12s 6d. for her, and it was
to be recommended to each division, but as a
body they do not assist any body—There was
a motion came forward then, for a declaration
to the public, but objected to by two divisions,
saying, power supersedes the laws, or, as it
suits them, leaves those lawsdormant—sather
have a constitution without a king than a king
without a constitution. .

A declaration of what ?—I have not got it
down here, and I do not recollect what it was:
it was some declaration to the public—rather
have a constitution without a king than s
king without a constitution :—This we say,
if reduced to be republicans.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre —Who proposed to
publish that declaration? —This was a matter
that was brought forward by some one of the
delegates at the meeting, upon every thing of
that sort that was proposed, the opinion was
taken of every delegate, one after another,
and in the course of taking that opinion, there
were two of the divisions, or two of those de-
legates, that objected to it. ;

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Did that stop
it ?-—I do not think any thing was done in it.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—-Was it according
to the course of the business, that if two di-
visions objected, the measure was stopped for
the time?—-No, only by the majority—-Mr.
Margarot then reported, that we had had no
letters for two months, except one he had re-
ceived that day, but the seal was opened and
it was sealed again; it was then mentioned
there were five delegates from the Roman
Catholics, that they were of the same mean-
ing with us, and it was agreed to try and see
if we could not settle a correspondence with
them.

Mr. Bower.—Five delegates present that
day?--No-—it was reported that they were in
London, Irish: Roman Catholics. .

Delegates from Ireland?—Yes, then in Lom
don—The next is the meeting of the division
No. 28, January 8; I have it down here, that
the declaration, which is, I suppose, the de-
claration mentioned before; that division met
at No. 38, Crown-street, Moorfields. ,

Was the prisoner there ?—No; I have get
down here, that the declaration ; it is
opinion of this division that it should be re-

jected—it was agreed, likewise, not to address

the king at all.
 |


|

| ts that a declaration of the principles of the

| society?—The declaration mentioned in the

| last meeting, I cannot tell what it was ; it was
said thet Mr. Grey would not bring forward
his motion for a retorm, unless petitions Lig
sent to parliament ; ed to petition parlia-
ment by all means, af not to address them.

Mr. Erskine.—Repeat that ?—Unless the

} several societies petitioned.

| Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—And they agreed

| to petition by all means ?—Yes—The next is

j} a meeting of the 10th uf January 1793, at

| No. 31, Old Compton-street, seventeen dele-

} gates attended; the declaration was ordered
to lie upon the table; then it wasagreed upon
that no written papers should come to a meet-
ing of delegates but by a delegate, or through
the treasurer or secretary ; carried unant-
mousy.

Mr. Bower.—Was Mr. ardy there ?—Yes ;
Ido not remember Hardy being absent one
night; Mr. Margarot then reported, that the
country correspondence did not shine.

What do you mean by shining ?—That there
were but very few letters—He reported that
he had sent a letter to the Friends of the
People at Free-Masons’ tavern; the answer
was read on the 15th of December, accepting
our correspondence, that a reform by perse-
verance will be obtained

That is the answer from Free-Masons’

tavern?--Yes; and that they revered the
constitution for protecting persons and pro-
perty, and recommending us to be careful not
to mix foreign politics with home politics, and
to avoid foreign correspondence, by which
means they would prevent the imputation of
levellers, and would 1 prove that we are other.
wise inclined ; signed, D. Stuart, secretary,
No. 52, Queen-street, Dean-street: it was
then remarked that this society never had
brought forward their principles, and it-was
determined not to correspond with them;
Mr. Bell, one of the delegates, in consequence
of the remarks that were made upon this
letter, made this observation :---Our addresses
to the Convention of France, prove, that we
mean their laws here.

Was that assented to or dissented from, or
what was the conduct of the committee upon
it ?—It was not objected to; it was approved
by all the meeting.

Recollect whether any person present made
any observation upon that?--Mr. Margarot
said, no doubt; but there was not any Body
else that objected to it; it passed with the
silent assent of the rest of the company.

Did Mr. Margarot say any thing clse as to
what should be the conduct of the society ?---
At that time they were under a good deal of
difficulty, being disturbed in their meetings,
and avast deal of very strong language had
been held both then and at former times, and

atterwards too.

You do not recollect whether he said any
thing more than that?—-Not particularly; it
was observed by some one of the delegates,


that Mr. Pitt’s plan to add a hundred mem-
bers to the House of Commons would not do,
for wat alld al give them mes advan-

» an us from: a proper reform; Mr.
Gani tisen ast ‘he knew a person of the
name of Dolon, who was secretary, and one
of the Irish delegates too, and that he was
ee off to Ireland ; that he knows his ad-

8; he explained to him our endeavours, of
which he approved, and he proposed to cor-
respond with him; he said the Catholics had
succeeded entirely; Bell had a friend that he
knew, whose name was Devereux, one of the
delegates, and he agreed to correspond by the
post—however, that was said to be dangerous,
as no letters go through the post-office—That
is the whole of that meeting. The next is the
14th of January at Mr. Hardy’s—-Mr, Hardy
had sent fifty of our addresses, and twelve of
Keirsant’s specches.

Keirsant’s speech where?-—In the French
Convention.

Who told you Mr. Hardy had sent them ?-—
He said himself that he had sent fifty of oor
addresses, and twelve of Keirsant’s speech in
the French Convention, to different corres-
pondents in the country.

When you speak of addresses, what do you
mean ?—I mean of the original address of the
society, .

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.~-This was a con-
versation at the prisoner’s?—-Yes,I called upon
him; this I had from him at hisown house in
conversation. The next is a meeting of dele-
gates on the 17th of January.

How many attended ?~-I fancy I shall come
to it afterwards.

Where was that meeting?---At No. 31,
Compton-street ; it was then reported, that
nineteen of the divisions were kept up at that
time ; it was then agreed upon to debate, and
to consider whether or no the age ot eighteen
or twenty-one was the most proper age for
allowing of voting for a member of parlia-
ment, and one reason given why eighteen was
the proper time of life to have a vote, was, it
was mentioned that they were liable at the
age of eighteen to be militiamen—A motion
was made by the delegate of division 18, to
appoint a committee and report Carter’s case,
and his family, and of the money necessary
for their support: division No. 12 recom
mended to consider of a public meeting to
discuss a perliemearayy reform, but that was
referred back again; the delegate of No. 15
recommended the society’s addresses to be

iven, five to each member, forthe purpose of
Seliverin them out to the public; the dele-
gate of division No. 4, made a motion, that.
the thanks of this society be conveyed to the
mayor of Glasgow, a society at Durham, and
a society at Dundee, for uniting with us in
our intentions, and that it be recommended to
correspond with them ;---sixteen dclegates
met; a petition from Carter presentcd---he is
sentenced to six months imprisonment, to pay
a fine, and find sureties; it was a remark of

Mi t’s, that it was supposed it would be
for life; a committee appointed to inquire
into the opens of his defence, and the man-
ner in which it had been conducted by Martin;
a motion then was made, for all the delegates
to meet every Saturday evening for public
conversation, paying a-penny each for the
room-:-agreed to, and to be when Carter’s
business isdone; this public conversation was
to discuss politics for the purpose of inform-
ing themselves of the situation of the then
times, and what steps were pursuedain the
House of Commons. The next is January the
17th.---A letter from Norwich, that they ad-
mired our spirited conduct very much—that
they wrote to Mr. Grey on the 11th instant,
and to the Friends of the People---the Friends
of the People propose a mild reformation---
they want to know if they are friends~-that
the societies are numerous, and in the count
the magistrates prevent their increase ; signed,
Blake,---that is, the letter received was signed
Blake :---Benjamin Hobhouse,* esq. at Bath,
had formed a society agreeable to ours; he
advised us to point out a conveyance, and he
would inform us how they went on-—it was
agreed to send a letter by the post—-if it was
not answered, then to send to a Mr. Richards,
hookseller, at Bath ; then it was recommended
to correspond with the Societies at Norwich,
through the means of the Bell Society.

What is the Bell Society ?—Some society,
I believe it was at Norwich :—January ath,
No. 31, Compton-street, there were two gen-
tlemen came with a petition, which was drawn
up, as it was supposed, by Mr. Harvey of the
Temple—one of them was a delegate, who
formerly had been delegate for No. 11, saying,
Mr. Thompson's house had been searched m
the dead of the night—Mrs. Thompson relies
upon our sopra as promised—it was then
determined that no such promise ever had
been made to her—she wanted assistance to
go to France—Hardy said, he had given her
2d. 15s. 6d. on the 5th instant, and then she
thanked him—Martin thought it should be
rejected, but it was agreed to—Martin then
reported, that he had an er-officio from the
atturney-general, and he might be as much
an object of the support of the delegates, and
of the divisions, as she; upon Martin's exa-
‘mination, he.drew up a long brief, and showed
‘it to Mr. Vaughan, who had no objection to
.defend it—dfterwards he said it was indelicate
to defend it, it being his own writing, and he
wished it not to be known—it was recom-
“mended to apply to Mr. Erskine, but he de-
clined it—then Mr. Garrow was applied to,
he was found averse—then it was recorm-
mended to Mr. Fielding, he declined it—then
Mr. Warren undertook it—Martin said, that
Grant was the sole cause of Carter's punish-
ment, he had got the manuscript of the bill,
and he declined looking for it—Martin wanted
-to see it destroyed—it was then determined

* In 1812 created a baronet,


that Field, the sub-secretary, should apply to
Grant, and if he did not give it up, thal be
should be expelled the society, and then he
would be expelled as our honorary visitor at
the Crown and Anchor tavern. :

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—What manuscript
is that?—The manuscript of the bill, which
was stuck up by this Carter, which he was
imprisoned for: it was mentioned then that
Littlejohn, likewise, was an honorary member,
and that he would also be expelled; Martin
then said, that he had seen Carter, who said
that he had got in his pocket that which
would do for the delegates—It was them de-
termined that he should not receive his
guinea a week after this, unless he asked
pardon, and the manuscript was given up by
Grant.

Mr. Bower.—Who should not receive a
guinea a week ?—Carter should not receive 3
guinea a week which he was allowed by the
society. Motion from division 16, to address
a letter to the Friends of the Liberty of the
Press, for their exertion at the Crown and
Anchor, the same people as met there under
Constitutional Information. A letter from
Norwich to be answered, but it was not
A letter from Richter, saying he dare not at-
tend us, but that we may depend upon his
being a friend: he carried the to
Grant. The delegates are to meet next Thurs-
day, No. 8, Queen street, Seven-dials. The
delegate of the division (I think No. 5) is
going to France, and he has got some copies
of T. Paine’s works; he received a letter on
Tuesday night from a friend at twelve o’clock,
saying, “a hint to the wise, you will all be
taken up.”

Was Hardy present?—Yes. The next is a
meeting of selegeiea on the Sist of January.
A motion brought forward by the delegate of
division No. 16, which was Baxter, wishing
that six-pence may be paid only to the society,
and the other seven-pence to go towards the
expense of their room, it was agreed that this
might be a very proper measure to be adopted
for pos divisions ; it was particularly re-
marked that at that time the people round
Spitaltields were exceedingly numerous, and
supposing that they should come to any open
resistance these were divisions that ought

| particularly to be encouraged.

Mr. Bower.—Repeat that slow ?—A motion
was brought forward by the delegate for No.
16, Baxter, wishing that six-pence (a quarter,
it should be) may be paid only to the society,

-and tbe other seven-pence that was paid, to

go towaris the expense of their room ; it was
agreed that though this might be very proper
in all poor divisions, it was remarked at that
time, and it was assented to by the whale
Meeting of delegates, that supposing there
should be an opposition, or that the two
parties in fact stooald come to an open de-
claration, an open rupture, that it was abso-
lutely necessary to give encouragement to the
divisions meeting in Spitalfields, for that they
 OO


in youl were very poor, and very numerous,
and it was very necessary to keep them toge-
ther. There was a good deal of conversation
upon the necessity, and the propriety of it.

Have you all that in your minutes ?—It is
from recollection that I speak this-—but this
is the meaning of what was agreed upon b:
all the delegates that met at that time, but it
was particularly first of all mentioned by
Baxt

t

er.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---How much of it
have you a minute of ?---I have got no further
than that it was agreed by the delegates that
this might be very well in poor divisions, the
other is recollection which I remember per-
fectly well; I have made a remark before of
these divisions, that they increase so fast, that
they were well satisfied that, in these divisions
alone, very shortly they would have as many
in number as there were in number in all the
other divisions besides, A motion was made
by the delegate of division No. 7, that Mr.
Law's letter to Mr. Reeves, giving his reason
for withdrawing himself from them, be pub-
lished, to show the infamy of their proceed-
ings, that the society was falling away very
fast; but this motion was rejected, and in-
stead of that, to publish extracts from “ The
War, or who pays the Reckoning?” deferred
the selection for one week. Our letters to the
Friends of the People, are directed to Mr.
Byng, chairman of the committee, they have
directed their secretary to answer it—their
answer is to keep from foreign politics, to

One of the Jury.—Whom is that from ?--
This is only giving an account to whom our
letters were directed when they corresponded
with the Friends of the People, there is an
sumer at oe ame wherein it advises us to

eep from foreign politics, to kee
order, and by petition we may socket in
‘was answered by Maurice Margarot, saying
‘we mean to proceed orderly, but you are not
explicit.

id Margarot say any thing, make any ob-
secralion as to the committee of delegates ?
—Yes. ,

LordChiefJustice Eyre.—Does your minute
purport that that reply was produced at this
meeting of delegates, that it was produced
upon that day ?—-I will not be confident of

that.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre-—Go through your
minute and see what it is?—It was answered
by Maurice Margarot, saying, we mean to pro-
ceed orderly, but you are not explicit.

Mr. Erskine—Do you mean answered in
writing ?—In writing; there were several let-
ters that were wrote by Margarot himself

-without being shown to the delegates, and
after he had wrote them, when lic came to
the meeting of delegates he reported that he
hhad wrote such a letter, and he gave the heads
of such letter. He said to that society, but
you are not explicit, and he requested that
t

ee -


they would be more particular; your concur-
rence will assist us, but we want to know how
far you mean to po in the design ; then a re-
mark was made that we are very apprehensive
of creating a breach between them, as is the
case between them and the Constitutional
Society; there was a good deal of conversa-
tion in consequence of that letter, that the
Society of the Friends of the People did not
go so far in their idea as the London Corres-
ponding Speiety and the Constitutional So-
ciety did, for-all along it was held as an in-
variable idea that eventually it must come to
a struggle.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.— You are not
speaking now from a minule?—From my re-
collection of what was often repeated.

Mr. Bower.—Do you recollect Margarot
saying any thing after this reply that he had
sent to the Friends of the People ?—Margarot
stated that there was a disunion between the
Constitutional Society and the Society of the
Friends of the People; but I cannot say I
recollect exactly what was the reason of it.—
There were thirteen delegates met that night.
—A letter from Sheffield of the 1G6th’.of Ja-
nuary, 1793, signed, David Martin president,
Horsefall secretary, recommending a commu-
nication with all the societies in the kingdom,
to form a constitutional meeting, and all to
agree upon the same thing—asked how far we
mean to proceed at this time—A reform nuga-
tory, unless universal right is established, and
they advise a general petition to the House of
Commons, on the present inadequate repre-
sentation—they want to know if the Friends
of the People are true friends—Margarot says
we are getting on too fast again, and that pe-
tition was not the mode.

Was that an observation he then made, or
your own observation to the delegates ?—His
observation to the delegates.—Margarot said,
petition was not the mode; but at the same
time it was agreed upon by him and the rest
of the delegates, that petitions should be pre-
sented for the sake of Reaping. the public
mind agitated with a reform. It was then
recommended that all the divisions should go
to No. 52, in Frith-street, and sign the ad-
dress of the Friends of the Liberty of the
Press ;—that is, every delegate wus to recom-
mend it to his division, at the next meeting.
—In the course of the mecting, Margarot
made a remark, that our address to Mr.
Reeves was not liable to any punishment, or
he and Mr. Hardy would have been taken up,
Margarot said, he meant to invite sir Samp-
son Wright to his division, or any one that
he might send to the divisions, to show the
legality of them; thatis, the whole of that
meeting of delegates. The next that I have
is only reports at the divisions made by
members at different times.—On the 5th of
February, in Crown-street ; this is——

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Did you attend
no longer as a delezate?—Yes; this is a
meeting of the Division No. 23,—Bambridge

read a minute that there are sixty friends to
the cause, who decline at present meeting the
society; but they are good friends, and sin-
cerely wish them success; and some of them
say, if they want money, they are ready to
contribute.—He says, there are certain reli-
gious societies in the kingdom, almost in
every town, whose sentiments lead them
strictly to republicanism ; they are numerous
in Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Bristol,
Manchester, Hull, Derbyshire, and particu-
larly in London. The society in London are
just now beginning to organize themselves
agreeable to the principles of France—their
meetings are Mondays and Thursdays.—It
was then suid that Tom Paine’s Works had
been published in Sweden.—The next meet-
ing was on the 7th of February, of Delegates,
No. 8, in Queen-street, Seven Dials.

Was the prisoner there?—He was. At
this meeting it was proposed that the surplus
of the quarterage of the different divisions, if
there should be any, should go towards paying
the deficiency of Baxter’s division, No. 16,
for their room. We must preserve the divi-
sions No, 25 and 16, being poor, they will be
of great service if we go to war.—This was an
observation from Margarot at that time.

. No. 25, and No. 16, were, I understand,
the Spital-fields divisions? — They are the
two Spital-fields divisions.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre —Was the expres-
sion, war ?—Yes.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Was there any
explanation given of that expression ?—The
explanation that was given was this—It was
understood:

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I did not ask
how you understood it, but whether there
‘was any explanation actually given in words,
at that time, by any body, of what was meant
by war f—That the country would rise against
the present government.

Mr. Bower.-—Who said that?—Margarot.

- Did Margarot say that the country would
rise against the present government, or did
he use the word war, and you understood that
‘he meant by that, rising against the govern-
ment of the country ?—He made use of the
‘term war.

And you understood he meant that ?—Yes;
and it was mentioned by several of the dele-
gates, that it was eventually expected that
there would certainly be a rising in the
country. :

Was there any conversation of that kind at
the time when Margarot made use of that
expression ?—Yes ; it was taken up and spoke
to by several of the delegates that night.

Mr. Erskine.—Have you any note of this?—
I have not; but I remember it perfectly —A
letter sent to Bath has been gone fourteen
days, and no answer.—No letters received
this week.—A Sheffield letter of the 16th of
January, 1798, by order of the Society for
Constitutional Information, conveyed to all
societies, they request to know how far they


mean to go—it is their opinion that we should
be of one opinion to petition parliament this
season—it will give strength to the cause.—
The restoration of the right of election not to
be under twenty-one—by doing this we shall
know how far we can support Mr. Grey’s mo-
tion this season—no time to be lost—Hardy
proposes a delegate from each division of the
society, tu agree how to proceed—Mr. Fox
has said in the House, the people have aright
to alter the government when they please-—
the Scotch have done it, and the Irish.—The
London Corresponding Society was first formed
to send a delegate to all the other societies,
to determine the best way of reform.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—You said that
Hardy proposed a delegate from each divi-
sion ?—That is, to agree how to proceed ; thal
is another thing—next follows Mr. Fox’s ob-
servation in the House of Commons.

Mr. Bower.—Who states that observation
of Mr. Fox’s—I do not know; it was cb-
served; and the same with regard to this, I
do not take upon me to say who particularly
said this.

What is meant by first formed ?—is it de-
scriptive of what was the intention of the so-
ciety when first formed? or what is the
meaning of it?—It is simply an observation
that was made from one of the delegates,
saying, that the principles of the society first
of all-—the intention—was, for arefurm in par-
liament.-The Friends of the People in the
Borough yet exist; and it was determined to
communicate our letters to them and all other
societies, and inquire their intentions.—It
was then agreed that a circular letter should
be sent to all the socictics in London, to meet
two or three from each, and come to some
determination.—-The question to be debated
at each division, was, what is the best way
of proceeding ?—This is to be done by adver-
tisement in Saturday, Sunday, and Monday's
papers, that it will be discussed the next
night at each division, and that there are to
be six advertisements—fifteen delegates met
-~It was then determined to write to Sheffield,
and to inform them that we will answer them
very shortly, how we mean to proceed.—The
next is the 14th of February, 1793, division
No. 19, met at Mr. Godfrey's, an attorney, in
Fore-stréet, and chose him for delegate ; but
we rejected him, being lord George Gordon's
attorney, and agreed to reject connected
with him.

Why did they reject him on that account?
~—They were determined to have nothing at
all to do with any person that had any con-
nexion with lord George Gordon; * and the
division No. 12, had a n of the name of
Watson, supposed to be secretary to lord
George Gordon, that attended them; and it
was intimated that lord George Gordon was
by some means acyuainted with what was


joing on; that he made use of this Watson
f; way of bringing forward different things;
{ they conceived he would be very troublesome,
j an that if his name was connected with the
{ Corresponding Society, it would make them
disrespectful in the eyes of the public; they
then rejected him.—Division No. 12 to meet
next Wednesday evening, at the Crown in
| Newgate-street ; but if refused at the Crown,
to go to Robins’s coffee-house in Shire-lane,
who would take in any of the divisions.—To
be considered next meeting, whether you pe-
tition parliament—that will engage the public
attention for the present.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Does it appear
whether there was any delegate chosen, or
not?—There was no farther proceeding upon
' this, than just remarking, that it would be
* necessary to come to a determination at the
' next meeting of delegates, whether it was
' agreeable to the differcnt divisions to petition
' parliament.—This was a meeting of the de-
' Jegates.

' Lord Chief Justice Eyre. Whom was

Godfrey rejected by ?—by the delegates, or by
his own division ?— By the delegates.— Agreed
to demand a conference with the Constitu-
' tional Society—they are drawing up the state
of the representation, and are going as far as
us.—The Friends of the People do not go so
far.—The Borough Society do not go so far.
—The Holborn Society say they are for re-
publicanism.

Mr. Bower. What is become of the Iol-

born Society?—It is broke up; and the
greatest part of the members have joined the
Corresponding Society since—The Aldgate
Society is now called the Bother’em society
—that society is since broke up.—There are
about six societies in London to confer
with.—tThe Friends of the People have not
yet answered our lJetter.—A letter sent to the
Constitutional Whigs at Sheffield, saying, we
are about a general conference, and shall write
to them.—There are two societies at Norwich
united — the Constitutional Society wrote
them to continue, and assured them we are
firm, and mean to collect the general opinion.
~—Three questions for consideration in the
divisions, whether they shall petition the king,
,or the purliament, or call a convention.

Was that contained in your letter to the
society at Norwich? —This is what was
agreed by the meeting of the delegates, to be
sent by each delegate to each division, to con-
sider what they should do at that time; and
it is statedas three questions—frrst of all whe-
ther you will petition the king, or whether
you will petition the parliament, or whe-
ther you will call a convention, to be sub-
mitted to the delegates. It was remarked
that it might be as well to decline coming to
any resolution till the whole nation are
agreed.—Then Margarot says, neither pe-
Lition nor remonstrete, it would be unconsti-
tutional-—that finishes his observation. —-Then

1% is reported that the Aldgate society hadthank-



ed Mr. Fox for his speech, saying that the

people may alter the constitution without

giving their reasons for it—that is the society

that were got together, and called the Bo~

ther’em society.—The next is a meeting of

division No. 23, on the 19th of February, ia

Crown-street — {t was agitated there, upom
the question, which was the right age for

election, eighteen or twenty-one—there wasa
great difference of opinion in the meetiag—

one was for eighteen years, ten for twenty-one,
and one for neither, unless householders.—
Printed copies of the petition to parliament
to be distributed amongst the public—that
means that they had come toa determination
to petition parliament, not to petition the
king, nor to call a convention.---Field met
the division No. 12, at the Crown in New-
gate-street—they were refused meeting---they
then went to Godtrey’s, and re-chose him #
delegate.---I do not know whether I have
mentioned that this was a delegate meeting,
on the 21st of February, at‘No. 31, Compton-
street--this last matter Godfrey rejected —bee
ing re-chose, he insisting on his rightof being
deleguie and insisting upon staying in the
room, there was no other way of getting rid
of him but by adjourning to No. 57, Charles-
Street, to meet on the Saturday evening.---It
was reported that a great number of delogates
were in town from Scotland, upon a reform.
—A letter from Southampton, approving of
the plan, and want our addresses to forms
society, and wanted us to correspond witbr
them.—A letter to be sent to them by divi-
sin No. 28.—The Constitutional Society
have adjourned till the 15th of March, sup-
posed to see what Mr. Grey does in parlias
ment.~Agreed to write to all the societies,
both in town and country, to send a petition
to parliament—no time to be lost—ours to be
drawn up immediately; and we are certaim
that twenty thousand will sign it--if they are
all rejected, write to them to continue; and
then will be the time for all to unite, and to
petition the king.—This is a report likewise
—that the Friends of the People approve of
Mr. Grey’s remonstrance—it is a leading
feature-—Reported that the serious stoppages
from the bank’s refusing to discount, will
assist the cause, from the failures.which must
follow. “

Mr. Enskine. Is that @ report, or what
somebody eaid ?—I mentioned it as a report
—it was reported by one of the delegates, at
the meeting of delegates—net that it came
from any of the divisions.—A letter was read
from T. Farley, esq. upon the illegality of
imprisonment for debt, saying, he had
been five years writing a treatise on it; and
he wants us to subscribe to it—it was agreed
that we could not give him that support'that

we supposed that he wanted ; but, however ex-

tracts might be made from that book, so as to

be serviceable.—A letter from the Friends of

the People, dated 15th of February, in answer

to ours of the 1st of February, signed by

 \


E. Jeremiah Carter, chairman, saying, verysoon
their plan would come forward to reform all
the abuses existing —Mr. Reeves’s society is
unconstitutional, their society is to create an
organ to speak to the legislature—they will
not give up their power of action to any so-
ciety—but they say the time of action may
not be very distant—this is a letter from the
Friends of the People.

Mr. Bower.—Where at?—I rather think it
is from some country correspondence—I have
not got down whence it comes—it is signed
E. Jeremiah Carter, chairman.

How is it introduced in your minute? as

mane from whom ?—A letter brought and
read.
« Where did it come from?—From the
Friends of the People, signed E. Jeremiah
Carter, dated 15th February, in answer to ours
of the 1st of February.

Mr. Bower.—We have read the letter—he
has put it down Carter—it should be Curteis
—itts published, folio 64, in appendix E. of
the Report.

Lynam—They will not give up their power
of action to any society ; but they say the time
of action may not be very distant—it is some-
thing to this purport.

: Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—That is your no-
tion of it—your extract /—Yes.

_ Mr. Bower.—Did you hear the letter read ?
— Yes, it was read —Answered the Norwich
society, that we think that the Friends of the
People are friends to the cause.---Twelve de-
‘legates met—to write to the Bath society.—

.Purpose—and that the London Corresponding

Society are going to petition, and write toa!

cause the subject to ie agitated every week—
no time to be lost—and say that we equally
lament the war.

Was there any letter prepared in’ come.
quence of that ?—The London Correspondirg
Society have drawn up a petition, which as

resented Mr. Gerrald, who said he

ad applied to Mr. Mackintosh, who said he
would go with him to get Mr. Fox to present
It.

Were there any letters prepared, in come
quence of this agreement that they should
write to Sheffield, by Margarot or “ other
person ?—~Margarot wrote this letter of course,
the substance of it was this—————

Mr. Bower.—That is in appendix to the
Report, page 6?—we have read it already—
What is your next?—March 7th, 1793, Ne.
31, Compton-street, fourteen delegates met.

Was Hardy there ?—Yes,—Read the pet
tion to parliament, and refer it to be consider-
ed by each division—the title of the petition.
The Inhabitants of London, Westminster and
their Vicinity.—The discussion of that took up
the whole of the evening.—That new dele-
gates should be chosen on the 28th of March.
The delegate of division No. 1, moved that
the Essay wrote by Mr. Frend,® of Cambridge,
on the war, and published in the Manchester
paper, be printed and delivered to all the div+
sions. Mr. Frend, of Cambridge, is tryin
now ; and it is supposed he will be exclud
the College.---The remainder of the evening
upon the petition—the petition to be mace
out upon rolls of parchment, and each dele
gate to have one, to try what coffee-houses
will take it in to lie to receive signatures.—
March 21, 1793, No. $1, Compton-street—
Baxter reported that, some constables had
been at division No. 16, to disperse them, but

February, saying, as you meet to overturn the
constitution, you have warning that warran®

Hardy, the Ictter was requesting to corres
pond, to strengthen the love of the humea
race, and to restore the representation of the
people—-it complains of the venal mode of

-election—the poor's rate, tythes, and the

dearness of provisions~they are determined te
think and speak for themselves—to petitoa
parliament—speak, unite, and it will be done
—those are the heads of it as I gathered: ths
letter was not directed to Piccadilly, but
the house that Mr. Hardy lived in before be
went there.—There was a report that the
Friends of the People had received two hettess

ae as +



from Sheffield, directed to Mr. Stuart; there
was no notice taken what the letters were—-
Grant and Littlejohn discharged from the
London Corresponding Society, and to write
to the Constitutional Society, and to ask
for other honorary members to represent
them.

What was Grant discharged for ?—For
withholding the manuscript formerly men-
tioned.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre..—Was it said
where these two letters came from to the
Friends of the People?—I take it for granted
from Sheffield; but I have not put it down.
Litdejohn was discharged for the neglect, I
believe, of his division; he was gone down
into Scotland.

Mr. Bower.—--Did you minute what Grant
was discharged for?--In consequence of a
former resolution, that if he did not deliver
up the mapuscript he should be discharged ;
and now they were discharged. A motion
was made by Margarot to print a thousand of
Trend's Address to Republicans and Anti-
Republicans, to make extracts frum it by a
select committee, with some strong remarks
thereon by them.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.-—What was the
tile of Mr. Frend’s boak?---An Address to Re-
publicans and Anti-Republicans; there were
six to form that committee, and to meet in
Paternoster-row, at Stifi’s house. The next
meeiing was the 28th of March, at No. 31,
Compton-street, a meeting of delegates. It
was agreed to bring all the quarterage next
Thursday, the Patriotic Society, in Holborn,
joining the division No. 29,

Was this Patriotic Society the same you
mentioned before, that broke up, and the
greatest part joined the Corresponding So-
ciety ?--The same. The report was of the
number of signatures to the petition; the
whole was seven hundred eighteen on the
five skins. A select committee chose to
make laws for the society, and to submit
thein to each division, to meet every Thurs-
day afternoon at five o'clock; any three to
proceed to business; other delegates allowed
to visit.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---Have you any
minute of any debates upon the subject of the
necessity or the occasiun of proposing this
committee ?—-I have no minute of any debate.
I see here is a mark made here—the commit-
tee to make extracts from Mr. Frend’s Ad-
dress to Republicans and Anti-Republicans,
they are to meet on Sunday evening—four-
teen delegates met on the 4th of April, in
Compton-street—the select committee to con-
sider of their future regulations, first of all for
the society at large—the general rules and
vate regulations for the admission of mem-

—the week’s payment— admission of
8—vote of exclusion—the number of
constituents before you branch off—the sum-
Monses sent to each night’s meeting—that is


regulate—the next is, the constitution of ge--
neral principles—committee’s laws relative
to themselves—the said delegates private re~
gulations—laws relating to the society election
of chairmen and of door-keepers.

Mr. Bower.---It is not worth while to state
this; go to your next meeting.—The next is
the 11th of April, at No. 31, Compton-street.
The report was that two thousand had signed

| the petition: resolved to thank the Friends,

of the People for their impartial state of the
Tepresentation. It was then said that the.
Constitutional Society at Shefheld had done
it, and had requested them to publish it ina
cheaper manner. In their lelter they say the
pape are sleeping too long; the ignorance,
of the people is the cause of the continuation
of the corruption of the senate—resolved to
write immediately to every society again, and
request them to petition directly ; small bills
to be stuck up in the night, informing the
public where the petition lies for signatures—
fourteen delegates met—Mr. Francis to be
réquested to present the petition—recom-
mended by division No. 2, to advertise a ge-
neral meeting at some tavern, and we may
get a good many signatures there-—already
signed, 2,519.

You may go now to the 29th of April; T
do not see any thing material till then-—-the
anniversary dinner of the Constitutional So-
ciety at the Crown and Anchor,—were you
present at that dinner ?~—TI was. .

Did you make a minute of what passed
there?—-I made this minute---that many of
them talked very boldly, and laughed at the
fears of the public---they are sure that a re-
volution will take place in this country.

Who was in the chair ?---Lord Sempill was
chairman--.the next that I have got is the
sentiments that were drank---The rights of
man---May we never be ashamed to assert
those principles we wish to enjoy—May des-
potism be trampled under the hoofs of the
swinish multitude---May the world be our
country, and doing good our religion--- Freee
dom to France, and peace to all Europe---
Thomas Paine.

Have you any remark upon that ?—TI have
senesced here that Horne Tooke requested
him to be given a second time---may the
temple of freedom have the earth for its basis,
and heaven for its dome—may governments
soon cease to be a conspiracy against the few,
for the rights of the many. .

Is not that reversed ?.—No; I have it so-—
by lord Daer, John Horne Tooke for his vigi-
lant opposition to despotism—The victims of
despotism, and may the people of Great Bri-
tain have courage to redress them, lord Sem-
pill, Mr. Fitzgerald, &c. Those are the toasts
that were drank. The next is the second of
May, 1793, a delegates’ mecting, at No. 31,
Campton- street. r, Fox wrote to Mr,
Hardy, at nine o'clock at night, that our say-
ing a radical reform would be understood uni-

‘be part of that committee's cousideration to | versal suffrage, which he was not a friend to,

but would present the petition if we desired
it: in consequence of this it was determined
to get Mr. Francis to present it, and to write
to him on Saturday morning ; the petition to
be presented on Monday, unless Mr. Grey
debe off his motion—two of the Sheffield de-
legates that brought up their petition made
honorary members—agreed to meet on Sunday
evening at Compton-street, and bring in a!l
the skins.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Did not you say
that there was a resolution that there should
be a new clection of delegates on the 28th of
March ?—Yes.

Lord,Chief Justice Eyre —Was there a new
election of delegates ?—Yes.

Lord Chief Tiatice Eyre.—Were you re-
elected ?—Yes ; on the 25th of September.

Mr. Bower.—You have got a minute the
16th of May, have not you?—I have mislaid
that by some means or other.

Do you remember any thing passing upon
the 16th of May respecting the war and the
addressers?—No.

Mr. Edward Luuzun called again.

Mr. Bower.—Look at that paper. Did you
find that among Mr. Hardy's papers ?—Yes.

[It was read,]

© South-street, Ind of May, 1793.
 " Sir;—I am to apologize to you for not
having sooner answered your letter, but I
have been very much engaged in business
for some days past. I will certainly present
the petition if it is desired, because I would
not decline presenting a petition for any of
my constituents; but I confess I think it
might with more propriety be presented by
some other member, because it is generall
understood that the radical reform, which it
recommends, is universal representation, to
which I have always been an avowed enemy.

“—I am, Sir, your most obedient and most

bumble servant, C. J. Fox.”
[No aeidreas
Indorsed, Charles James Fox, M. P.

received 2nd May, 1793.

Mr. Bower to Lynam.—As you have mis-
laid your minutes of the 16th of May, I will
not press you upon it.—I have the minutes
of May the 16th here--No. 31, Compton-
Street.

Was the prisoner at that meeting ?--Yes ;

e was,

What passed there?---A motion from the
division No. 7, to draw up a remonstrance
against the war; it was then said that Mr.

lardy had received an anonymous letter,
saying that, as the late petition lay at your
house, I look upon it you are secretary; and
he says, being a friend to man---something---
and the salutary rights; he very much ap-
proves of the petition and the thanks to the
minority; he submits it in his letter, that if
& petition against the present war is brought

forward, it will refute its being a lar one;
then he goes with regard to the subscriptions

and the expenses of the society.

Mr. Bower.—-You had better pass it over if
you cannot make it out well.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre —Was any thing
done upon that anonymous letter ?—it does
not appear that any thing was. The next was
a meeting of the delegates on the 23rd, at
No. 31, Compton-street ; it was then pro-
posed to calla peneral meeting, which would
be an irrefragable proof of our being legally
assembled, and would take away those reflec-
tions upon us, and dissipate the fears of the
public: this was to be agitated at each divi-

sion.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.--Who made that
proposition to call a general meeting ?—I can-
not tell. There were twelve delegates met;
a letter from R. Littlejohn, dated 18th of
May, in which he says, he was surprised that
he was excluded the society ; his attachment
is not to be bought or sold, and he would not
give up the cause but with death ; this is what

collected from that letter. Committee for
drawing up an address to the public, &c.;
then it was observed, that Le Brun’ letter to
lord Grenville has altered the step; on that
account it would appear as though we had
some communication with France, therefore
we ought to wait to see if any notice is taken
of it. It was thought proper to refer the ad-
dresses to the public at that time, and it was
referred for a week.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre-—-What did you
say it might be thalety to do ?—It would ap-
pear as though we had some communication
with France. The next meeting was on the
30th of May. I do not find any thing more
than Mr. Hardy’s intending to make a mo-
tion that we should b: up for three
months.

What was done upon that?—It was not
carried, but the society continued ; for I have
areport on the 6th of June, in consequence
of it. The next was a meeting of delegates
of the 6th of Jume, 17938, at No. 31,
Compton-street---there were three divisions
that wished for Mr. Wharton’s motion in the
House of Commons to be printed.

Was any thing done with respect to Mr.
Wharton's motion ?---I have no remark that
any thing at all was done, notwithstanding it
was so recommended. A public meeting was
then talked of; to advertise five for six
o’clock,

Lord Chief Justice Eyre. -— Advised ot
agreed upon ?-—I shall come to that presently.
I forget whether it was determined upon at
that time, but there was a meeting which fol-
lowed afterwards; this is the beginning of
it; it was agreed to admit every division.

Mr. Bower.-.-What was the proposition?
To advertise a public meeting; and that it
should be advertised to meet at five o'clock,
but the intention was to meet and begin upon
business at six; a motion from division No. 8, —


of Mr. Wharton’s speech correct—Mr. Mar-
garot will get one thousand for us.

Have you any thing farther of that meet-
ing ?—Nothing more.

"about this time did you for any period cease
to be a delegate? Was there any division
upon what you have been last reading?—I do
not recollect that there was.

Mr. Erskine —Do you mean to say that

uu recollect there was not }—My answer is,
if there had been any thing of the sort, I
should have made @ memorandum if any
thing particular; I do not recollect that there
was any thing of a division, but I remember it
was said by Margarot-—————

Mr. Erskine.—Is that in your note No;
Iam going to tell you my recollection. He
said he would get a thousand for the London
Corresponding Society ; but I have no minute
of that; if you mean to put that down as

that the thanks of the committee be given to
Mr. Wharton for his motion and speech.

Mr. Erskine.—-Mr. Wharton the member
of parliament?.—Yes 5 and it was agreed to be

inted, and the thanks to be published in
Fret papers, the Courier, Chronicle, Gazet-
teer, and Ledger.

Mr. Bower.—Does it appear by your mi-
nutes whether it was only to be published, or
have youany farther entry respecting what was
to be done besides publishing?—I have this me-
morandum, that it was to be put once in each
paper; that is to say, that it was to be adver-
tised four times; it was likewise agreed that
there should be some comments made upon
it, and a special committee, to draw it up, of
five of the delegates; it was to be an open
committee, and to meet at six o’clock on
Monday—A letter from Leeds, a delegate
meeting, May the 30th, 1793, a societ lately

society, to correspond with all societies, and

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Was this a
meeting of delegates > Yes.

Mr. Bower.—it is all at meetings of dele-
gates, unless I shall mark it as some other
meeting.

‘Lynam.—Resolved that thanks be given to
the twelve men that voted with Mr, Whatton
the 6th of June—The Constitutional Society
for information have published ten thousand

from one of the division of a gentleman that
lives at Walworth, who is going to join the
Jondon Corresponding Sociely : and it is at
the same time observed, that he wrote the
offensive play-bill, the guillotine, his name is

evening, in the information that they endea-
voured to bring forward of different circum-
stances, it was stated in that way, and it was
followed up by a remark from the same:per-
son, that many people supposed that he was
employed by the Convention in France.

Were any other papers brought forward ?—
It was reported that there was a petitian to
the king brought forward at the last meeting
of delegates; but that itwas declared treason-
able by Mr. Vaughan, in consequence of
which auother was to be drawn up.

When you say it was treasouable, do you
mean to say that that was Mr. Vaughan’s
opinion ?—It was reported by several that Mr.
Vaughan had given that as his opinion.

Was any thing done upon that ?—That is

all.

Did the delegate report any thing farther,
after it was found that that petition was sup-
posed to be treasonable ?—Only that another
was to be drawn up.

Was there any thing farther done at that
meeting ?—I have no memorandum of any
thing else.

Or have you any recollection? if not, go on
to the next meeting, which was on the 7th of
October.—The report of the delegate was,
that there were eighteen new members made
that week.

That was at the division meeting?—Yes,

the same division meeting, Oct. 7th, that a!

Mr. Bell, who was at Brighton, was going to
Ireland, and would introduce a correspon-
dence with the societies there, from the Lon-
don Corresponding Society. At the last
meeting of delegates a petition was brought
forward, or agitated, was brought forward,
discussed, I suppose, against the war, nothing
more.is said of that. Hvdgson was chose
president, and Hardy was continued secre-
tary; the next is November the 5th.

Before you go to November the 5th, were
you present at any other meeting, at Hackney,
or any other place ?—Yes.

At what time was that—it has indeed been
proved to be the 24th of October ?—I do not
recollect the day of the month that that
meeting was, but it was to elect two delegates
to send down to the Convention at Scotland.

Were two delegates elected at that mecet-

a FW
ho were they ?—Margarot and Gerrald, I
think.

Who appeared as president of the society
at that time?—Llodgson. :

Where was this meeting?—At a house in
Hackney-road, the election was ina garden
behind the house.

Was Mr. Hardy at that meeting in Ilackney-
road?—I think he was, but 1 will not be
positive.

What meeting were you aton the 5th of
November ?—Division, No. 3, the delegate
reported, that Hodgson had resigned, and

‘that Baxter was chosen chairman; he then
reported that Margarot and Gerrald went to


Scotland, the 80th of October,.-and that the
fund was very low, the subscription not equal
to the expenses.

Where was this?—At the same place ncar
Bunhill-row; the next report was that a
second delegate should be chose from each
division, to furm a sub-committee, to revise
the constitution, and to meet every Friday, at
No. 31, Compton-street; the next. report was
of a new society formed at Bristol; the next
that colonel Macleod, and Mr. Sinclair, were

one as delegates to Edinburgh, from the

‘onstitutional Society; the next meeting was
November the 12th.

Before you get to November the 12th, were
there any reports made upon the 5th of No-
vember, respecting F, low ?—I have no
memorandum of that.

Do you recollect any thing stated about
Franklow, upon the 5th of November ?—I
recollect it being said, that there was going to
be an association formed at Lambeth, for the.
purpose of learving their exercise.

Recollect all the circumstances that youcan,
respecting that.

Mr. Gibbs.—Let us understand that you
have no memorandum of this ?—No.

Mr. Bowcr.—Do you recollect any other
circumstance that was to attend that meeting?
—I understovd that they were going to form
themselves into different societies.

Of whom were those societies to be com-
posed ?.--I was going to say a plan was
forming for those societies to learn their
exercise at different places all over London,
| and that it was to be confined to the Landon
| Corresponding Society. :
Do you recollect any thing farther being
; said about the plan?—Not partheaarly.-

Afterwards it _was more particularly broug
forward; but I have not, to the best of my
recollection, any thiug more.

The plan was not at that time completed?
—No, the forming of the society, and how
they were to meet, to carry it on, was not at
that time mature to the best of my recollec-
tion, but this was said, that there was a variety
of people that did intend to learn their exes-
cise, but this at Lambeth was the only one
that was mentioned.

There was no association formed Lut the
Lambeth?—No, but it came out afterwards,
and probably, it will not be improper to men-
tion it here, that there were members of the
London Corresponding Society, that had a
desire of introducing the exercise among the
London Corresponding Societies divisions oa
different nights, from the night that the divi-
sions met on different evenings.

Was that agreed to or otherwise ?—It was
rejected at No. 23, but this is only antiei-
pating it.

It will come better in its order by-and-by;
who was president of this society, on the 5th
of November, chairman of the delegates, and
so on?—The report of that division meeting
wag at the first committee night of the dele-


s, Hodgson had resigned the chair, and
ter was chosen chairman.

Were you present at any meeting upon the
28th of November? — That is a division
meeting.

Of which division ?—No. 23.

Where was it ?—At the same place.

What was done at that meeting?—Read a
letter from Norwich, signed W. Cole, from
all the societies there, approving of the Con-
vention at Edinburgh, and requesting a con-
stant correspondence; finances are very low,
they want to get a second subscription in
order to support the delegates in Scotland.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Do you mean
the finances at Norwich or of your society ?—
From Norwich, and then here seems a kind of
instruction to the delegates, requesting them
tovisit all the societies in Scotland.

Mr. Erskine.—Let me take that down in
your own words; there seems a sort of in-
struction from the delegates requesting them
to visit all the societies in Scotland ?

. Lord Chief Justice Eyre—How do you
state that?—The finances are very low, in
order to get a second subscription, in order to
support the delegates in Scotland, the instruc-
tion is with regard to a letter that has been
sent to the delegates requesting them to visit
ail the societies in Scotland,there is something
that I gathered from the delegate, reporting it

the committee of: delegates.

Mr. Bower.—That was the regular way of
making these reports ; the common ordinary
course of the society #

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Is this that you
state about the instructions part of the letter,
or what was done by the society upon the
letter?—Done by the society.

Mr. Erskine.—It must have been some-
thing, he says, but we have not heard what it
must have been?—It was reported that the
finances were very low, and they want to get
@ second subscription to support the delegates
in Scotland,

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—That was part of

the Norwich letter?—I thought so at first,
but Jooking at it again I rather conceive that
this is the report of a delegate from the com-
mittee of delegates.
_ Mr. Erskine.—There seemed to be a sort of
instruction,
gunered from a delegate, who collected it
from the committee of delegates, I thought
it was the Norwich letter first, but looking at
At again, I rather conceive—what do you con-
ceive ?

Lynam.—That the finances of the Corres-
ponding Society were low, and that they
wanted a second subscription to support the
delegates in Scotland. -

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Then what was
Meant about instructions?—The instructions
were in a letter that had been sent, but by
whom I have no memorandum here,to the de-
legates to visit all the societies in Scotland.

td Chief Justice Eyre—Do you mean
*

concerning something that I |


that there was an instruction sent to them in
a letter ?—I do; it was reported by the dele-
gates, that there was goihg te be a second
general meeting to be held at Edinburgh, but
afterwards it was altered and intended to be
held at_ Glasgow instead of Edinburgh.

my Bower.-—This is the 12th of November?
—Yes.

When were you re-elected, if ever you were
re-elected, a delegate from any of those divi-
sions ?

Mr. Bower. —-We have the letter which has
been read of the 8th of November, from the
prisoner, to the delegates in Scotland.

Mr. Gibbs—Have not you some notes you
have gone through ?—Yees, I have put them in
my pocket. :

Mr. Gibbs.—I desire to look at them?

The Witness delivers them to Mr. Gibbe,
saying,—1 presume you will give them me
again.

Mr. Gibbs.—What reason have you, sir, to
suppose that I will not give them to you
apes Te you mix them, it may be impos-
sible for me to arrange them again.

Mr. Gibbs—You have given me these
papers, mark them 1, 2, 3, 4.

Mr. Bower.—I bey to go through my exa-
mination; do not be marking apers while I
am examining you; put them in your
pocket till we have done. You were elected
a delegate again at what time?—The first
meeting I attended of the delegates, being
re-elected, was on the 2d of January, 1794.

Was Mr. Hardy a new member, when
you attended as a new member?—He was
secretary.

After you re-commenced a delegate ?—Yes,

Now go to the ed of January, 1794?—-The
first is the election of delegates I believe, I
need not read them over; the first resolu-
tion was to remove the committee rvom to
No. 8, New Compton: street; to remove the
meeting of delegates to No. 3, New Compton-
street; then a resolution was passed, that no
person but what had belonged three months
to the society, was eligible to be elected a
delegate; it was agreed to draw up a hand-
bill, approving of the conduct of the delegates
in Scotland, anda censure on the magistrates;
to distribute one thousand in Edinburgh.

Was this a delegate meeting ?---Yes, to cen-
sure the conduct of the magistrates; to dis-
tribute one thousand in Edinburgh, and they
were to be sent down immediately.

How soon were they to be sent down?---
To the best of my recollection the urgenc
was explained to be very great; and I thinke
they were to be sent down the following
night. A letter was read from Shefiield,
signed William Brown Broomhead, chairman,
recommending some spirited resolutions to
be adopted to support the delegates imme-
diately. i

Mr, Erskine.-—-Read that again?---A report
read from Sheffield, William Brown Broome
head, chairman ; it recommends some spirited

resolutions to be adopted to support the dele-
gates immediately, and it likewise says, that
at this meeting there were about two thousand ;
T believe that is all at that meeting ; the next
J have is the 9th of January, at No. 3, accord-
ing to the resolution at New Compton.- street.

At which meeting I believe the prisoner
‘was not present, was he?---I am inclined to
think he was there, though I have not got
his name down, I have the names of a variety
of delegates and other people that were to be
stewards for a meeting that was to be held on
the 20th, I think.

What passed at the meeting ? if you find any
thing to enable you to say that the prisoner
was there, we will take it down; if not, we
will take it that he was not there?—-A general
meeting to be at one o’clock, on ths 2vth in-
stant, to meet Mr. Gerrald, and havea dinner
at five o'clock, at the Globe-tavern im the
Strand.

One o'clock, on what day 7--On the guth
of January, a sub-committee was formed for

management of this matter; the sub-
committee that undertook the management
of it from the 9th to the 29th, were Thelwall,
Franklow, and Stiff; the names of the stew-
ards are, Sohn Thelwall, John Agar.
- John Agar, have you the christian names at
full length in your minutes ?---I may be mis-
taken in the christian name, which has some-
times happened, but I have it John Agar, and
Srewart Kydd, barristers, John Lovett, H. F.
Harrison, T. Stiff, Bartholomew Peacock, J.
Philip Franklow, Thomas Harris, C. Sinclair,
J. Powell, W. Williams, Thomas Mitchel,
John Pearce, Matthew Moore, Wm. Moffatt,
and J. Martin, attorney.

Did you see Wm. Moffatt —Wm. Moffatt,
it was said was a delegate of the convention
at Edinburgh * Agreed, that tickets for the
dinner should be five shillings, those that
dined were to pay five and sixpence, and those
that did not dine, paid six-pence for those
tickets.

Have you any minute of any sub-com-
anittee ?—-a sub-committee to draw up a letter,
and send to all the socicties,to unite them all
in one general sense in an address to the
public, on their invaded rights by the pro-
ceedings of the magistrates at Edinburgh. It
was mentioned at that meeting, that they
should discuss the conduct of the right
honourable Mr. Dundas, respecting the trials
of the delegates in Edinburgh.

Who were to be the sub-committee for the

ses of Wrawing up this letter, and dis-
cussing his conduct?—-I have not got down
the names of the committee.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Was it a different
sub-committee, from the sub-committee that
was to man the dinner?--Yes; the next
minute that [ have got, is of the 20th of
January, at the Globe-tavern.

_ * See the Minutes of the British Conven-


case there is a dance,

[800

Mr. Bower.-—Have you no farther minutes
of the business of the 9th of January; you
are not yet come to the sub-committee; is
that a minute of that day, or of the 20th
of January?—It is on the same day a sub-
committee to be chosen.

Does it appear that any sub-committee was
chosen on that day?--.There was a sub-com-
mittee chosen, but 1 have not got down their
names.

Was there any plan agreed upon to be pro-
posed, on the 20th of January, respecting the
proceedings of this sub-committee?---1 have
read over what I have got down, and I recol-
lect nothing more.

You stated, that you ceased to be a delegate
from Midsummer, to near Christmas, how
came you to cease to be a delegate during
that time ?—I ceased to be a delegate, in con-
sequence of one ef the London Corresponding
Society, making # report some time before,
that I was a spy upon the society, and I was
tried in consequence of it, I think on the 13th
of June, I was tried by the committee of
delegates.

What was the result of your trial ?—I was
acquitted by a very eee repaid:

aving been acquit a majority, you
then wis sn a dele te, before the
time you have last been speaking of ?9—I was
re-elected, the next meeting I attended was
the 2d of January, 1794.

Mr. Erskine.—When was it that you were
reported to be a spy, and were tried?—I think
it was the 13th of June.

Mr. Bower—Now come 5 the 20th of
January; were you present at the meeting at
the Globe-taveth, apa the 20th ef January?
—Yes, a meeting the 20th of January, athe
Globe tavern, J "Martin, president .

What time did you go to the Globe-tavern
that day ?—I went to the Globe Tavern, be-
fore the company had assembled, or business
began, but I do not recollect precisely the
hour they were assembling, so far I havea
very clear recollection, in the one pair of stairs
room, and that in the course of their consulta-
tion, and talking with each other, that the
floor of the room gave way, and created a vast
deal of confusion.

In consequence of that, I suppose, they did
not stay in the room; after the floor gave
way, where did they go next?—To the room
above.

Were you there at any time in the after-
noon ?—I was there before the business began,
and I was there till the business was finished,
and the resolutions at that time were read,
indeed I have a report of it here.

After the floor of that room had given way,
and it was necessary therefore, that they
should adjourn, and they had got into the
room above stairs, where did the chairman, if
there was any, place himself; what was the
situation of the chairman?—There is a place
for the musicians, at the side of the room, 0

A sort of balcony, oF gallery ?---Just so, Tell us what passed?—It was recommended

chose on that night, but I have not got the
names of them, for the purpose of watching
the parliamentary proceeding, but the sub-
delegates part was not carried ; it was propo
sed that that committee should be made per-
petual, but I have no memorandum whether
that was carried or no.

Was any proposal made for printing any
thing ?—I have mentioned, it was proposed to
publish the names of those who had given
evidence against the patriots.

You do not recollect any thing else ?—I
have not got memorandums of any thing else;
it_ was recommended that hand-bills should be
stuck up, saying, what grievances we BUS-
tained.

You do not recollect any thing else ?—No.

Jere you present at any delegate mecting
upon the 30th of January ?—Ycs, January the
goth, No. 3, New Compton-street.

Was Mr. Hardy there 2—Yes—Division No.
11, recommended to divide the metropolis into
divisions, and to open the divisions to all

arts, and to request of all those who do not
Belong to us, to subscribe for the delegates ;
this was referred to the constitutional com-
mittee.

What was meant by opening the divisions
to all parts?—The opening of those divisions
was, to endeavour to have meeting houses all
over London, of different divisions of the so
ciety, those that lived nearest to a place of
meeting, it was recommended to them to at-
tend at the meeting nearest to them, for the

urpose of collecting friends round about near
that place where that division met, and so all
round London.

Were any number of persons stated or

agreed upon to compose these several meet-

in the same room, however I will not say that
positively, but 1 did not dine with the large
company; I was in an adjoining room with a
few of the company who could not get seats ;
I came into the large room after I had dined.

‘Was the prisoner in the room that you

came into after you bad dined?---Yes.

Was Mr. Thelwall there ?--Yes, he was

chairman at the dinner, but Martin was presi-
dent at the meeting.

What passed when Martin, and Thelwall

were there, after you came in ?—Alll the re-
ort IL have got is the toasts after dinner.

Were there any resolutions at any time

made in reference to the generat objects of
the society, proposed by Thelwall, and agreed
to by the meeting, there assembled ?~-1 have
ot a memorandum here, that after Mr. Ram-
sey’s report of Mr. Margarot’s trial, that next
was read andcarried, the "address to the Nation,
which is dated at the Globe-tavern, although
it was drawn up prior to that—-If I were to see
it, I should know what resolutions were passed
at that time, that is the only remark have

t made of it; then follows the dinner ; there
wyere several people in the course of conversa-
tion that 1 did not know, but conversation
was kept up by different people thdt got toge-
ther; I have made a remark, that there was
very bold language made use of.

Mr. Gibbs.—this was a meeting, not com-
posed wholly of the members of the Corres-
ponding Society. . .

Mr. Bower.---Hardy was present.

_ Mr. Gibbs.—But he is speaking of conver-
sation that passed from people there, whom
jhe cannot name.

Mr. Bower.-—Were you present at any dele-
gate roeeting, any where on the 30th of Ja-
muary? No, I must beg you to go to the 23rd
of Jauuary, I must not pass over that?—No. 3.

it should branch off, and then have a new
number ; but, however, that was a matter that
was very little attended to.

No particular number were to your know-
ledge proposed ?—No; the division Nu. 13 re-
commended that the delegates be instructed to
advertise, and request a many spirited friends
that do not belong to us to come forward and
subscribe to the support of the delegates.

How muchwasto be subscribed ?—As much
as they could prevail upon them to subscribe.
Division No. 8, in Rotherhithe, wished to
know if they shouldremove into the Borough,
having had a constable with them, many
have lost their business,and are afraid of press-
Bangs. The next was the call of the house.

hat do you mean by the callof the-house ?
-—The delegates attended the call of th
house, ‘ ,

Go on to the next after that?—A motion
‘was made by Thelwall that there should be a
Permanent committee of delegates to consider
of measures to be pursued during the present
posture of affairs, and to be a secret one ; those
of the feat committee of delegates chose,
to be filled up by other delegates, and they
were to be invested with a discretionary power
to report to the committee.

To what committee —To the committee of
delegates; but the committee of delegates
had a power to dissolve them when they
pleased. :

‘Was it mentioned of whom the secret com-
mittee were to consist ?—They were Martin,
Baxter, Williams, Thelwall, and Moore; that
was carried unanimously.

Was there any secretary appointed to the
secret committee ?—None,

What was to be the. power of the secret
committee?—The secret committee was to
consider of what measures were necessary to
be adopted at that time, and so long as they
should sit, according to the measures that
were adopted in the House of Commons.

What were they to do, were they them-
selves tocarry any measure into effect, or how
were they to act?—The secret committee was
to have a power to call the general committee
of delegates together when they saw it was
Necessary, and at any time, or at any place.
This was agreed to also.

What was the next thing that was carried?
——A sub-committee of three to consider of the
best mode to increase subscriptions for the
delegates in Scotland ; this was referred to the
secret committee with full powers,

What was the next thing done ?—There
was.a letter from Margarot,.but I have no
memorandum whether it was read or not.

Nor of the substance of it, have you?—No.

Then go on to the next.—It was proposed
by Thelwall that a committee of two, as a
committee of exigence, should report tothe ge-
neral committee.

How was that committee of exigence to be
formed, two from all the societies, or how to
be formed ?—I have it down herewA com-


mittee of two as a committee of exigence to
report to the general committee, but not to
publish any thing: but this was withdrawn—
T have here a letter dated the 28th of January
1794, from Old Friends New Revived, that
they had collected as many friends as pussible,
and would publish their sentiments; that
they are increasing the Bristol Society for
Constitutional Information. .

Old Friends New Revived ?—They describe
themselves so in the letter.—On the 6th of
February there was a meeting of delegates.

Was Mr. Hardy there?—Yes, he was.—
The first thing that was mentioned there wa
that a letter was received from citizen |
with respect to his going down to Rotherhithe,
on account of the society established there
being disturbed.—Motion from the permanent
committee to nominate others in their places,
it being a secret committee, and those that
are to appointed are not to be known.
This was brought forward by the secret com
mittee, eaying that being a secret commit
tee they had found out that it was danger.
ous, and therefore they applied to the com-
mittee of delegates to dissolve them, and
give them power to choose another commit
tee in their place; and they likewise requested
that they might not be compelled to name
the names of those persons that were to form
the new committee, Division, No. 11, recom-
mended the committee to consider of the s-
tuation of Hodson and his wife, he was os
among the felons, and deprived of seeing his
friends: this was sent back on account of the
lowness of our funds, being obliged to support
our delegates. ;

What delegates ?—Delegates in Scotland—
Motion from division 29, that the names of
those who haye subscribed for the distressed
weavers be printed, and to be posted up; that
was not carried. A letter was received ins
parcel from Sheffield from Margarot to Hardy,
dated the 7th of January. _A letter from Shef-
field, dated the 30th of January, Joseph
Scofield the bearer, recommended to spend all
histime inthe societies. A letter was receiv-
ed from Gerrald, recommending them to send
down a short-hand writer to take his trial.

The delegate of division 18, made a motion
to reprint the Rights of Swine, and ordered it
to be printed by Pearce,—Motion by Pearee,
that a committee of seven be appoints to re-
vise the new constitution, an sn
Thursday evening. Resolved, that fifty thov-
sand hand-bills of lord Stanhope’s speech re-
specting the foreing troops be printed ; to re-


turn him thanks, and to engrave the doctrine : directed myself to the business, I shall answer

upon our hearts, and transmit it to our pos-
terity.

After this time you ceased to be a delegate,
or shortly afte: ?—Yes.

This is the substance of what you collected
during the time you were a delegate /—Yes.

How became you a member of this society?
—By mere accident.

tis your business?—An ironmonger,
and in the commission line.

How did you become a member?—I was
at the sign of the Mansion-house, when the
division No. 12, had a meeting there ; I knew
nothing at all of it, but the landlord had one
of their printed resolutions given to him, and
I. requested the favour of looking at it, and
upon seeing it, my remark to him was, that
it was a society formed for overturning the
constitution of this country, and I advised him
by no means tosuffer them to meet there any
more, for if he did, he would certainly have
his licence taken away.

Then you made yourself a member of the
society; how did you get admitted ?—I went
up to the society the same evening along with
two other gentlemen that were there. I un-
derstood that any person might go into the
poom ; there had been two or three had at-
tempted it, therefore they appointed a door
keeper to admit none but those that were
members ; one of the society endeavoured to
turn me out, however I went in, and had some
conversation with the president, whose, name
was Watson, and who was at that time sup-

to be secretary to lord George Gordon ;

we were chi a iyeerpune the com-

> Las lon of the society, saying,

Paid not mean to do any thing of the kind,

but understanding the society was on a public

, I should much obliged to them

for one of theirresolutions, and then I should
leave them to their own deliberations.

Then you were admitted a member in con-

uence of what you had observed ?—Yes;
the following night, in Newgate-street.

George Lynam cross-examined by Mr. Erskine.

Mr. Erskine.—I have very little to trouble
you with, for Mr. Bower has very kindly put
the questions to you which I was disposed to
put; I think you say you are in the commis-
sion line?—what sort of commission line?
—Both in the Birmingham and Sheffield.

At this moment are you ?—Not now.

How long is it since you were in this com-
mission line P—I have been in the commission
line, and am in the sada line now. >

I thought you said a moment ago, not now
—I have aaanority to sell by commission from
different people, but Ido not keep, or have
any stock left with meby any manufacturer at
the present moment.

I should think you have hardly leisure to
concern yourself with those sort of transac-
tions, have you?—TI have certainly leisure,
and if I am to answer you how it is that I have

you in a very candid manner, and tell you,
that Iam making an application for a busi-
ness in the East-India line ; thatis, to attend
at the coffee-houses to take orders from the
captains and mates, and different officers on’
board, but I dothat business on my own ac-"
count.

How long is it since you first conceived
this plan,—it certainly is a reputable one, and
I don’t find fault with it ;—how long is it since
you set yourself to this inquiry?—In a small
degree I have done it for I suppose these
seven years.

Taking orders for captains and mates, and
so on, ina small degree?—Yes; till the last
season.

How long is it since you did any business of
that sort ?—The last season. .

And the season before, and so on, for the
last seven years?—I never did so much as I
did the last season.

You were an ironmonger originally !—Yes ;
I was brought up to that.

Where might your shop be ?—I first of all
had a warehouse in Wood-street ; I removed
from oe house in Wood.street to another, and
from thence to Walbrook, where I have been
ever since.

Lm keepa shop open there now of course ?
—Yés. :

You do?— Yes.

You have always kept your shop open then
notwithstandiag this collateral business at the
East-India house, in the commission line ?—-
I have always kept a warehouse for wholesale
business ; 1 have never been in the retail
way since I left Shrimpton and company.

You were very much alarmed for the safety
of the constitution of the country upon reading
a paper I think that your landlord had shown
you?r-—Yes.

spauld you know that paper if you saw it?
—Yes

It isthe “ Resolutions” I believe?—Yes; the
resolutions and address. It is the address
that was brought out after the original one I
stated in the month of March 1792, that was
too small; afterwards it became more volu-
minous, and it has been made use of from that
time to the present.

Mr. Attorney General.---I should suppose
it was that of the 2d of May ?---No; it was
the 24th of May, 1792.

Mr. Erskine.—[(showing a printed paper to
the witness] is that the paper?—Yes, it is,

You were alarmed, and immediately said to
your landlord, that this was a society which
would bring on the destruction of this con-
stitution, and of course, asa good subject, you
immediately set yourself to inquire into it,
and to become a member for that purpose ?—
Yes.

I need not ask you, because it follows of
course, that in order to on that plan, it
was necessary that you shopld seem to think
as they did?—Yes.


You were elected a delegate ?—Yes.

And you contiaued a delegate until the
48th of June, 1793 ?—Yes; as near as I can
give you any intelligence.

Then you fell under suspicion, you were
oo and were acquitted by a majority ?—

es.
And pray, sir, if I might so far inquire into
the forms-of your trial, was the trial upon evi-
dence, or were you acquitted upon any decla-
ration of your own?—I was tried upon evi-
dence ; I was tried upon evidence that was
brought forward at the meeting of the dele-

ates.
8 Were you asked whether there was any
foundation for that charge or no ?—There
were four or five gentlemen brought forward
to the committee of delegates to prove that I
was nota friend to the society ; it took up a
long consideration, and it was verv late before
we parted, and after hearing all that they
could say, and from whence arose that sus-
picion, I was honourably acquitted. I have
got down the names of my accusers, in the
course of my minutes, but I did not take any
kind of notice of it, not thinking it necessary.

Then being honourably acquitted, you con-
tinued to attend the society regularly? I was
discontinued as 4 delegate; I believe I served
out for that quarter, but in that month I
went down into Staffordshire,and into York--
shire, upon business, upon an order that I had
from America.

At what time did you first communicate to
any magistrate that you were in the course
of this inquiry, and whether you furnished
them, or any particular magistrate, from time
to time, with the notes you have been reading
in court ?—I consulted with a friend, and in-
formed him that there were such and such so-
cieties about London.

Iam not asking you what you informed a
friend #—It is necessary I should state it; I
should be sorry for saying any thing that is
wrong, and I wish the world at large should
know my reason for doing it ; I did not do it
of myselt, but by advice ; it was a gentleman
that I had received friendship from at the
west end of the town; he recommended me
by all means to make a report of it; I did
make a report of it, and have done.

y And you have done from time to time?~
es.

When was the first of those reports made?
+I believe the first report that I made must
be in the month of October, 1792.

‘I shall not at present ask you who that
person was, and whether the report you made
was to any person entrusted with any public
station or merely to a private friend, to any
person invested with magistracy so as to
act upon it?—I do not know how far I am at
liberty to answer this question; I made my
reports toa person ina quarter that I was
well satisfied that a proper knowledge would
be had; whether it is by a magistrate, or
whether by any body else, it makes no differ-


ence, I was satisfied ia my mind that these
societies would be known by those reports.

If you had told me that it was any body
vested with any public magistracy, 1 would
not have asked, but having said it is nota
person in that situation, Lask to whom it
was ?—I have nat said so.

I wish then to repeat my question ?—I said
I would answer it in the best manner I possi-
bly could, and that is, whether it was a ma-

istrate or any other person, I was satisfied

om the quarter I gave my information to,
that it was well known that there were these
societies.

Did you hear my question ?—Yes.

Then surely you could not consider that as
an answer if you did; I put this questioa—
was the person to whom you communicated
your reports in the month of October 1799, 3
magistrate of any species or description, from
a justice of the peace to a secretary of state?

Lynam.—tIf 1 am by your lordship’s di-
rection to answer this question directly, I cer-
tainly will.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I think you mav
say that it was or not toa magistrate ?—It
was not to a magistrate.

Mr. Erskine.—Then to whom was it ?

Mr. Attorney General.—l object to that
question being put ; the principle which ad-
mits that it ought not to be asked if it were
to a magistrate, admits that it ought not to be
asked as to any body else ; for my part J cannot
see what it has todo with the justice of the
case. 3

Mr. Erskine.—I am surprised at this ob.
jection; is this man to be let loose for seven
hours with written papers, and am I not to
be permitted to try bie credit? when he says
that in the month of October, 179@, he in-
formed a person of these transactions, am
T not to be permitted to ask him who the
person is to whom he made those reports?
if he answers it was to such an individual,
may I not call that individual in order to show
peradventure, that these reports had no exis-
tence at that time, or that he did not show
them to the person named? I shall be per-
fectly satisfied with whatever judgment the
Court please to pronounce upon this occasion,
but I certainly think it my duty to insist upen
the question.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—It is perfectly
right that all opportunities should be given to
discuss the truth of the evidence given against
a prisoner; but there is a rule whieh has
universally obtained on account of its impos-
tance to the public for the detection of crimes,
that those persons who are the channel by
means of which that detection is made, should
not be unnecessarily disclosed: if it can be
made appear that really and truly it is neees-
sary to the investigation of the truth ef the
case that the name of the person should
be disclosed, I should be very unwilling to
stop it, but it does not appear to me that it is
withia the ordinary ceurse to do it, or that

nally put, your lordsbips will permit me first
to state what was the fact at the time that
this objection arose. My learned friend asked
the witness, whether the person to whom he
made the Communication was or was not a
magietrate? As 1 understood the answer of
the witness, it was to this effect; that he

ghere is any necessity for it in this particular |
case; all that this witness say6 is, I did this
upon advice; I did from time to time com-
municate with @ friend for the purpose of its
being communicated to & magistrate, and in
that manner it was that I eame to know these
transactions.

If there is a rule that the channel by which
those communications are made should not
be disclosed, that rule I think will extend to
this case: I rather think that we have this
day determined that there is such a rule,

I cannot satisfy myself that there is any sub-
stantial distinction between the ease of this
man’s going to a justice of the peace, Or oing
to @ magistrate superior to @ justice of the

watched by those whose duty it was to attend
to it, The question immediately put upon
that was, ifit wasneta magistrate, who was it?

Now I know I ought tostate with great dif
fidence, any opinion of mine upon a question
of evidence, not having for years
any of the courts of law, not knowing what
the practice of the courts is at thie day, and
not being therefore able to state from princi-
ple what rule is to be deduced from that
practice ; but in the course of the early period
of my life I have had a good deal to do with
this sort of business in the courts of law, and

sense of duty founded upon what I think the
clearest principle of duty to every individual
who forms a part of the community—I state
this—that after the witness has distinctly said
that he mentioned this to a person who was
to communicate it to those who would neces-
sarily take care of the interests of society, in
consequence of that information being com-
municated, that that channel of communica-
tion brings the name ofthat person within the
tule the Court has laid down. :

Mr. Justice Buller.—Did the witness say
he mentioned it to this friend for the purpose
of its being communicated to a public officer?

Mr. Erskine.—No.

Mr. Justice Grose.—“J am satisfied that
from the quarter where I gave my information
the societies would be known;” I believe
those were the words.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I have it thus:
“ He made a report to one, who, he was
certain, would communicate it, but not toa

istrate.”

r. Gibbs.—I think he said before that,
“ T consulted with a friend who recommended
it to me.”

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—He did so.

Mr. Erskine.—The manifestation of inno-
cence is as great a principle in the administra-
tion of justice as the punishment of crimes.

Mr. Attorney General.— Most surely.

Mr. Erskine.—I will go back again, with
the permission of the Court, in my examina-
tion. You told me that in the month of
October, 1792, you made a report; by making
a report, do yuu mean that you showed that
book to any body in November, 1792, from
which you have been now reading?—I did:
not. Your original question was, to know
how it was that I gave a communication;
there has been a misunderstanding, how it
was that I did give any information; I told
you I was advised by a friend to give a com-
munication, and that from him I was recom-
mended to give that communication, and I
gave it in a quarter—I believe these were the
express words—I gave it in a quarter that I
was well satisfied that it would be known,
that there were these sort of societies in
London; the mistake that has been_ made is,
that I ial rare d communicated with this
gentleman that I first of all consulted: I never
saw that gentleman afterwards, but the chan-
nel, the dearer that he directed me to, I
pursued all the way through.

You were advised by a triend, to whom, no
doubt, you had communicated what you knew,
to make that communication to a person
whom that friend recommended ? —Just so.

Was that friend, who advised you to make
that representation, a magistrate '—No.

Then who was that friend?

Mr. Attorney General.—I really must object
to the question.

Mr. Erskine—My question is not—who
the person is to whom his friend recom-


mended him to make the’ communication,
because he has said that the ee he went
to, by the recommendation of his friend, was
a channel from whence government was
likely to be informed; therefore I did not
mean to put any question in the teeth of what
the Court have resolved: but I have only this
to say, that I was not present in the morning
when your lordships determined it. M
juestion now is, who was the friend (which
riend was not a magistrate) who did advise
the witness to make the communication to
“Tord Chief Soatce Fagre-tF the pein

Gone because the disclosing who the
iend was that advised him to go to a magis-
trate, is a thing which puts-that friend-in a
situation into which he ought not to be put,
and into which it is inconvenient to general
justice that he should be put.
Mr. Erskine.—-Supposing, for instance, that
T were in possession of evidence, .but which I
could not pocetly proteas to contradict this
witness, that he made no such communi-
cation to any living being at that time; that
this is all an invention and fabrication (I state
it only for augument’s sake, which I have a
right to do), baw aki yeenble I should do it, if
I cannot allo to extract from the
witness who the person was to whom he
made the communication, and who advised
him to give information to some other person?
It will be asked, is it an honourable thine?
Is it to be ai that, in this country,
law and the liberty of the suede I
trust, that the law and the liberty of the
subject will always go together, and I hope in
that the time will never arrive when the
huzzas of popularity shall be against the
vernment and administration, but that
government and administration shall be so
conducted as to carry along with them those
huzzas of popularity which always attend s
government well administered—if that be so,
all I want to know is, that which can expose
no man to contumely, namely, that he has
advised a person, who tells him that he has
discovered something, which, erroneously or
otherwise, he conceives to be a conspiracy
against the public, and, he says, go to a magis-
trate

Suppose I were to advise any man who
told me he had discovered something which
he thought the public were interested im
knowing; I be id say, Iam bert Tam no
magistrate, I advise you to go to the secretary
of state, and tell it; should I think I was at
all brought in question for having given an
advice i could stand to in the face of
the whole world? how then can the public be
affected by it, if I was to go on to ask him
afterwards, who is that friend to whom you
made that communication ? Ifit were not for
what the Court has already pronounced, I
should say, that the same argument will even
go farther, namely, that if I were to call upon

the man to whom he made the communica-
tion, I could not extract from that man any
thing he said, but I could ask that man, did
the witness make the communication to you?
Su the witness says, I communicated
this in the month of November, 1792, to Mr.
White, the solicitor of the treasury, should
not I have a right to ask the solicitor of the
treasury, whether that fact were true or no?
I could not go on to ask Mr. White what he
did communicate to him, but I could ask him,
whether, in point of fact, he did communicate
it to him? And if he were to say, I never saw
the man in the month of November, 1792, at
all; I got the communication from another
channel ; I never saw his face till I saw him
in this court, would not that shake the credit
of the witness with any man of understand-
ing? I apprehend it would.

It seems to me, therefore, with the greatest
submission to the court, that the public is
guarded by that distinction; and, in the
course of the discharge of my duty at the bar,
I hope I shall so distinguish the cases, that,
in preserving the lives and liberties of those
who are to be tried, the law and constitution
of the country may thrive along with them ;
and they never can thrive unless they thrive
together. I think there is wholesome justice
init. All 1 propose to ask this witness is the
first question ; L cannot ask the second, be-
cause I will not attempt to ask what the
Court has decided must not be asked ; I sub-
mit he must state the name of the person to
whom he communicated it; then have I not
a right to subpcena that person? I will then
ask, when did you tell it him? at what place?
who were present? Then I ask that person,
is it true? But if I were to go on farther, and
ask, what did he communicate? in order to
try the truth of this writing, there your lord-
ships would stop me. I apprehend that is the
distinction.

Mr. Gibbs.—I submit to your lordships
whether this is not the distinction: That
where an informer in the Exchequer pro-
ceeds upon an information of facts—commu-
nicated by another person, that he should not
be called upon to disclose the person giving
him the information: But it is perfectly new
to me, I confess. I have no doubt it is my
ignorance, I mean blameable ignorance, be-
cause I ought to be better informed in my
profession; bat I never have met with an in-
Stance in which it has been objected to ask-
ing a witness, upon cross-examination, who
the person was to whom he communicated a
fact that he states, because it happens that
the person to whom he did communicate that
fact, did advise him to communicate it far-
ther to a magistrate. I know it is established
in the court, in which your lordship long
presided, that where an informer has commu-
nicated facts to a person, and that person has
acted upon the communication of those facts,
they cannot ask who brought those facts to
his kyowledge ; but ;"= you ask a witness


whether he has communicated it to any other

rson, and he tells you he has, whose name

e does not mention, because he says that

person advised him to communicate it toa

Magistrate. I think it never has been held,

in a court of justice, that that was an objec-
tion to the question. .

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—There is some
doubt in the court how the fact stands; whe-
ther, in consequence of the first advice that
he received from his friend, he
disclosed those circumstances to the same
friend, by whom he supposes it to be commu-
nicated regularly to some magistrate; or
whether he applicd to some other person. I
understood him that he applied to some other
person himself.

Lord Chief Baron Macdonald.—My reason
for wishing him to be asked, whether the
person, to whom he originally made the com-
Munication, was a istrate or not, was
exactly upon the same principle as my lord
chief justice now states. I could wish it to
be distinctly known, whether the person to
whom he first mentioned it was the person
who communicated it to a magistrate, or a
person who simply advised him to communi-
cate it to a magistrate. ay. .

Mr. Attorney General.—I wish to have it
understood that the objection I now take is
this: That Mr. Erskine has no right to ask
the witness who it was that advised him to

ive the information to a person who stands
in the situation of a magistrate; for, I say,
the person by whose advice the information
is given, is to all intents and purposes, the in-
former. I wish to explain myself; who this
person was, and what effect it may have in
the evidence, it may be impertinent to sug
gest; what it is intended to prove, really I
not know; but your lordships will recollect that
I stand here as the prosecutor for the public ;
if I were in my own cause I could sacrifice, at
my own pleasure, principles which appear to
me to be the principles of public justice ; but,
in the situation in which I stand, I do not
know how I can regulate my conduct better
towards the public, and towards the | paca
than by acting upon the principles of law, as
Iunderstand them, admitting at the same
time, that no man is more likely to be mis-
taken: but this I will say distinctly, that I
would not trouble your lordship with the ob
jection that I am now stating, if I were not
rfectly convinced, upon the best judgment
Pax form, that the question cannot be put
to the witness; and 1 mean, according to
my duty, and with very humble deference to
your lordships, to beg to have your lordships’
opinion. —

I know very well that it may be strongly
argued, as it is very strongly argued by my
learned friends, why, how are we to find out
whether a witness does or does not speak
truth, if we cannot ask him this sort of ques-
tion—who advised you to do so and su? Sup-

pose he says Mr, White, the solicitor for the

treasury, should not I call upon that gentle-
man?—not, says my learned friend (and i
wish your lordships to try this reasoning), not
to ask what were the particulars of the com-
munication, but to ask the fact, whether this
person did or did not advise with him in the
year 1792? Now what is the reason that you
cannot ask the particulars of the advice? The
vety same reason why you cannot ask to the
fact, whether he advised with him or not,
videlicet, that im the given case it supposed a
principle of public justice, which overbalances
the private mischief that happens in the case
stated.

In the Court of Exchequer it unques-
tionably happens every day, that a witness
says I received an information that there were
run-goods at such a place, I went there, and

found them. There it is impossible to deny

that the reasoning is just, which says, that
the credit of a witness may be tried by ask-
ing bim, whom did you receive the informe-
tion from? where ; under what circumstances ?
andif the man were bound te answer to those
questions, and he had spoken falsely, with
respect to the when and the where he had re-
ceived it, er under what circumstances, if it
- rested upon his evidence, wher you had fal-
sified it with respect te the preceding perticu-
Jars, yow could not believe him. gs to the sub-
sequent particalars, and the defendant must
be acquitted. Nobody will deny but that it is
a case, but it has become a settled rule,
beeause private mischief gives way to
lic convenience ; and it is an hardship which
occursin particular cases, in consequence of the
Necessities of public justice.

same; and yet it is quite clear that that di-
rect question, who gave you information, in
consequence of which you prosecute for those
penalties which are to ruin the defendant?
could not be asked. Then I ask this, whe-
ther, in common sense, and upon principle,
the man who advises him to inform, is not
substantially and really the inftormer—and
whether the principle ot law, which has said
that you cannot ask this question, because the
consequence of asking the question will be,
that those who may not have nerves so strong
as nvy friend and. myself, who would not care
a@ farthing if our names were mentioned ; but
great numbers of persons in the world would

- not choose to have their names mentioned on
such occasions; and with respect to that


feeling, call it fear, or imprudent reserve, n
is a substantial principle in Jaw, that aman
shall not have his name disclosed.
I have thought it my duty thus to state the
grounds of my objection. I have made it,
ecause I am convinced the objection is
right; when E state that, your lordship will
easily believe, I do not mean to contend that
it is right, because I am convinced it is right,
but because I cannot, I think, discharge my
duty to the public without stating my objec-
tion as I feel the objection; and in cases of
this great weight and importance, and indeed
in any case, I do not know how the attorney-
general of the country can proceed more
safely than according to his own notions;
they may be mistaken ones, but according to
his own notions of what the rule of justice is.
Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I, for my own
part, adhere to my opinion. I think we must
stand upon the principle, and that when
we tun into very nice distinctions upon
@ principle, we get into difficulties from
whence I never know how to disentangle my-
self, or to relieve my mind. The question is,
whether, if it be opposed, any of the channels,
by which this information and discovery comes
to the officers of the crown, should be une-
cessarily disclosed? Isay unnecessarily, be-
cause it is no part of this fact at all whether
this man did or did not mention this circum-
stance to this friend of his, or whether this
friend of his gave him any particular advice.
The only way in which it is permitted to be
asked, is, because it may enable the defendant,
by drawing out circumstances collateral to
the fact, to establish a contradiction to the
witness upon those collateral circumstances,
and so to affect his credit. Now that would
be true of every question that the wit of man
could suggest; yet, undoubtedly, there are
many questions which, even upon a cross-
examination, a counsel is not permitted to
ask. My apprehension is, that among those
questions whch are not permitted to be asked,
are all those questions which tend to the dis-
covery of the channels by whom the disclo-
sure was made to the officers of justice ; that
it is upon the gencral principle of the conveni-
ence of public justice not to be disclosed ; that
all persons in that situation are protected from
the discovery; and that, if it is objected to, itis
no more competent for the defendant to ask
who the person was that advised him tomake 3
disclosure, than it is to whom he made the dis-
closure in consequence of that advice—than it
is to ask any other question respecting the
channel of communication, or all that was
done underit. I never can distinguish, formy
own part, the oases; if my brothers are sa-
tisfied there is sucha distinction, I shail be
glad to submit to their opinion; but I think
the principle extends to this case ; for, un-
doubtedly, an immediate answer to the ques-
tion puts the person who gave this advice,
into the situation desccibed by Mr. Attorney
General, of being, in substance, the imformer
 817]

to government of this transaction which this
man discloses. I am of opinion, therefore.
within the general rule upon this subject, the
question ought not to be asked.

Lord Chief Baron Macdonald —Iit seems
you are agreed now with respect to this
tact, namely, that the person, to whom the
witness says he made the first disclosure, was
neither a magistrate, nor any person con-
cerned in the executive government of the
country, and that from that person he received
advice no longer to apply himself to him,
because that was of no use, but that he
should apply himself to some person, either
in a magisterial character, or in some way
concerned in the government of the country.
There is no rule more sacred, undoubtedly,
than that you ought not to ask any witness a
question by which it should be disclosed to
what magistrates or officer of the executive
government he gave communication; and
were I satisfied that the friend, to whom he
disclosed this matter, was in.any way a link
in the communication, or a channel truly and
substantially in the communication, I should
certainly think that rule applied to him. On
the other hand, it scems to me that upon a
cross-examination it is material, when a per-
son at a distance of time gives an account of
transactions, to know whether it was then
for the first time that he gave that account,
or whether he gave that account recently
after the transaction, or when he gave it, as
that is a matter from whence important in-
ferences may arise for the defendant.

I think that that question should be asked,
unless there should be a very great public in-
convenience on the other side, which renders
it much better for public justice in general,
that the defendant should Jose _the benefit of
that question. In the particular instance it
does appear to me, that a person not executing
magistracy is in no situation to make it
dangerous. A mere private peree simply
saying,:do not come to me, but go to some
person that can be of use, I think—as no pos-
sible disadvantage can arise in a case of that
kind—it is a fair question to be asked, in
order to ascertain huw a matter of this sort,
alarming him, and attracting his attention,
was or not revealed by him. I mean to draw
the line distinctly in this way, that this person
not being connected either with magistracy,
or the executive government, it does not seem
to me, in point of fact, to fall within the rule,
which rule I hold sacred.

Mr. Baron Hotham.—The witness has said,
he communicated this to his friend, under an
impression and full persuasion that through
him the intelligence which he gave was to he
conveyed to a magistrate; that he has dis-
tinctly said. Now the question, as it seems
to me, does turn upon the principles of public
policy. I confess, for my own part, that upon
those principles E cannot see any distinction
between making a disclosure to the magis-
trate himself, or making it to any person who




is to communicate that disclosure to the magis-
grate; the principle is, that public justice de-
mands, in many cases, that sort of secrecy,
without which government could not be car-
ried on. There are many cases, we all know,
where it is of the last importance to us all, that
such secrecy should be observed; and it is
admitted on all hands, that if the communica-
tion is made to a magistrate, you shall not
oblige the witness to disclose who that ma-
gistrate is; that is for the purpose of public
justice to the country. Now here this man
has communicated to his friend for the pur-
pose, and under the persuasion of his going
directly to a magistrate, being advised by him
to do what he did. I cannot myself, I confess,
distinguish the situation of that friend from
the situation of a common informer-+-and we
know very well that it would not be Permintat
to ask that question of him—here I consider
this (I am sorry to differ from my lord chief
baron) as a link of the same chain; I do con-
sider that it makes no sort of difference whe-
ther the intelligence is directly conveyed to
the magistrate, or by more indirect means;
the purpose for whieh it is disclosed to this
man is, that of being conveyed to the magis-
trate; and I think upon principle that public
justice would be defeated if such a thing was
allowed.

Mr. Justice Buller —Cases have been alluded
to respecting offencescommittedagainst the re=
venue laws, and therefore I paid the utmest at~
tention to what has fallen upon this subject
from my, lord chief justice, my lordchief ba-
ron, and my brother Hotham, because they are
better acquainted with those cases than I am.
The principle, as taken from them, I should
be dencseh to pay the utmost deference to,
and I think I do not differ from my lord chief
jastice in the principle he has laid down:
perhaps in the application of it I shal) differ
only a little, and I fancy my brother Hotham
and I differ in the application of the law,
rather than in the application of the facts.

My lord chief justice, and my lord chief
baron, both say, the principle is, that the dis-
covery is necessary for the purpose of obtain-
ing public justice; and if you call for the
name of the informer in such cases, no man
will make a discovery, and public justice wil}
be defeatcd. Upon that ground, therefore, it
is, that the informer for the purpose of a pub-
lic prosecution, shall not be disclosed. This
principle goes to exclude the question respect-
Ing the second person, that is, the person to
whom the witness, after having consulted his
friend, went to disclose all that passed; but
the material thing to be considered here is,
whether the witness should answer the first
question. Now let us see how that fact
stands. I agree with my brother Hotham, if a
middleman is made the channel of communi-
cation, he ought to receive the same protec-
tion as the first person to whom it is men-
tioned; but upon the fact of this case I take
it to be quite otherwise, because the witness,

3G

according to the evidence he has given, does
fot comnninicate to another man, for the
purpose of prevailing upon that other man
to go to a magistrate to make the disclosure,
but consults him merely in the character of a
private friend, reserving in his owu breast to
determine afterwards whether he should or
not make that discovery, which should er not
draw the attention of any person in office,
Now if his first conversation was merely
with a private friend, in order to make up his
mind whether he should or not make the dis-
covery to some person atterwards, for the pur-
ose of inquiry or prosecution, and reserving
in his own mind whether he should or not
follow the advice of that private fricnd, it
scems to me the case is different, and this is,
1 think, an answer to the arguments Mr.
Attorney-general has used; he has ably and
ingeniously put it upon this ground, that the
person who gave the witness the advice is, to
all purposes, to be considered as the discoverer.
I cannot agree to that, because it never was
the intention, in the communication made by
the witness, that his friend should be the dis-
coverer; he only asked him some questions
for the purpose of making up his own mind
whether he, the witness, should make the
discovery or not; therefore I cannot consider
that person who was merely consulted as a
private friend, as being the discoverer.. My
opinion upon the whole is, that he ought to
answer the first question, but not the second.
“Mr, Justice Grose.---In this casc, it seems
to me, that we all agree about the principle,
the question is, who is right in the ap-
plication of that principle; for we do most
perfectly agree in this principle, that the
name of the informer is not to be disclosed :
that isthe law stated; that is the law agreed
and argued upon by the counsel on both
sides. Then the question in this case is,
whether this persun, whose name is asked,
ig to he considered as the informer. Now
the evidence is this; I consulted witha friend,
who advised me what to do, and to make a
teport. I did so, and I have done it from
time to time. Then in consequence of whose
advice is it that this isdone? In consequence
of this man’s advice, whose name is now
asked. If it is in consequence of his
advice, I must confess it does seem to
me that, essentially and substantially, and
according to every idea of good sense, he must
be considered to be the informer: But it is
very true that, perhaps in the course of this
investigation, the name of some other person
may be inquired, whose name it may not be
competent to ask, and the reason may be this,
that in the course of this business there may
be more informers. than one, aad ine yume
rinciple that applies to one, will a of
Lely to the cthlerss and when I find bat
the evidence is, that this man advised the
witness what to do, I must confess that the
witness having acted in consequence of that
advice, he seems to me tu be as essentially

a pe I
nm


the informer as any one person can be in-thie
case, because if it had not been for his advice,
non constat, that this would have been done,
I therefore, however unwilling I am, and [aps
always exceedingly unwilling in a case where
life is at stake to shut the door of evidence,
yet where a point of great constitutional law,
that which is to affect the public justice of
the kingdom is in question, I must decide
upon it as my conviction tells me is right, at
the same time lamenting that there should
be such a difference in the Court as there is
now, because I am very willing to confess,
that it has not been the habit of my prace
tice, never having sat in that court, where
those questions most frequently arise, to de-
cide upon those questions; but however the
little ability I have I must employ upon the
subject; and taking the rule and the principle
to be that the name of the informer is not to
be disclosed, I can only look to whether this
person, whose name is referred to, is the
informer or not; he appearing to be essen-
tially the informer, I think, according to the
tule of law, the question ought not to be put.

Mr. Erskine.—Did you communicate any
other part to this person from whom you re-
ceived that advice ?—-No.

Was that before or after you had been at
the society ?---After. ;

How long after ?——I communicated it in-the
month of October: immediately after I knew
that there were societies of this sort, I com-
municated it to this friend of mine; he is s
gentlemen of very considerable property-—

Let us have nothing about him. Now you
know it is not legal to name him, you are

ing to give me a description of him?---

tis advice to me was, to give information :
this was after I was acquainted that there was
such a society as the London Corresponding
Society; in consequence of that advice I gave
information immediately, which was in the
samme month of October, 1792, and I continued
it to the month of February.

Did you communicate your reports ip
writing from time to time ?—In writing.

Did you givecopies of them ?—-I gavecopies.

You have nothing else, have you, in your
book, except that which relates to this bus»
ness?-—-I do not immediately recollect---I
believe I have some,

In that book from which you have been
reading most of the day ?-~I have two of them

Ts there any thing that relates to your pr
vate business in either of them?—I have some
private memorandums.

Fold them down, if they are loose; we do
not want to concern ourselves with your
affairs, or any thing that does not relate
to this business. Did not you appropriate
ee books for this sort of information?}—I

id.

What leads you then to apprehend tbat
there are any other matters riluve to your
other business in them ?—-I have this reason,
because I had a communication, and had in-
 |
| ,

formation from different gentlemen; and, oc-

« casionally, I made a memorandum ofthat
communication, and I should not wish for
that to be seen.

Look over your book.—It is impossible for
me to de it in this light ; I will look the book
over; I have no objection ; I will go into any
room and look it over, andI shall give you
ae book with the greatest pleasure imagin-
able.

Tam not asking any favour of you, or wish-
ing for any thing that I am not entitled to

' have.—I do not wish, by any means, to report
eny thing but what is absolutely the fact;
nor would I wish to withhold any thing that
Ido not think is right to be withheld. I
know there are some private memorandums,
and it is impossible for me to look them
through now, while 1 stand here.

Then take those out, and let us have the
pot to-morrow.—I am very ready and wil-

ng.
hr. Attorney General.—You will attend to
what the gentleman says?—I1 am pertectly
willing.

Mr. Erskine.—You have some papers that
are not mixed with any thing of that sort ?—
Iam not sure that there are no memoran-
dus of that kind on them. .

Was it the custom at these meetings of the
delegates of the.Corresponding Society forthe
members to take -notes of all that passed ?—-

‘That was always a regular rule.

For every delegate to set down every thing

that passed ?—Sometimes there was a com-
munication which has been conceived by the
chairman not proper to be communicated to
the divisions; and Margarot has said, you
must not communicate this; and as to this
book that you are asking for, the delegates
were allowed to take reports or information,
whether from the chairman, or any of the de-
legates, either with regard to a letter, or any
other matter. The chairman has said, though
you are informed such a thing has been wrote
or has happened, though you are allowed to
take a minute of it, we tell you it is not fit it
should be communicated to the divisions;
but that notes were allowed to be taken at all
times is true.

I am not asking what was allowed, but
whether it was the practice?—It was the
practice every nignt.

It was the practice for other members to do
as you have been doing, to sct down in a
loose paper, or in a book, all the transactions
that then happened ?—It was.

And the substance of what every body
said ?—I have heard of some reports made by
other people ; this circumstance might strike
me, and another circumstance might strike
another, which I might not take particular
notice of, or think it worth while to put down.

You do not profess that what you have
been reading is a regular account of the most
material facts that occurred; but that they
were such as were most suitable fur your pur-


Pose to set down?—I do not know howto
answer that question, as you put it, I do con-
ceive that a delegate being sent to know what
business the socicty was transacting, that he
should take the best account of it that he
possibly could. ‘

That was when a man was really a dele-

ate, but you were not there as a real

ond fide delegate, but for the purposes of
justice ?---I was elcoted a delegate, as I statcd,
in the beginning of November, 1792, and
continued so till the month of June, 1793.

T do not seem to make myself understood ;
did you set down every thing faithfully that
passed, or only select such matter as appeared
most material for the public to know?—-I put:
down every thing I possibly could; but I did
not put down every thing that did pass, nor
was it in the power of any of the delegates to
do so; but it was the invariable practice of
the delegates to-make minutes cither upon
paper, or.in books, for the purpose of commu.
Dicating what had been transacted at the
meeting of delegates at the next division, at
their meetings, on different nights, from
Thursday to ‘Thursday.

Then those are the very reports that you would
have made, had you been bund fide a delegate,
and dving your duty as such to that society?
—I made these notes as a real,bond fide dele-
gate to No. 23. I made those reports at that

jLvision.

Have you been in no other way of dealing,
but an ironmonger, and in this commission
way? have not you kept a china shopi—
Never.

When you communicated to this person,
who, you thought, would go and communi-
cate it toa magistrate, did you rest satisfied
that your friend wonld do so; or did you at
any lime go toa magistrate yourself ?—I in-
formed you, when you asked me that question,
that the information was not given to a ma-
gistrate : I tuld you that it was by the advice
ofa friend, who confirmed my own opinion,
entertained at the first. When I found this
society at the sign of the Mansion-house, it
was absolutely necessary it should be known;
he recommenced me to that quarter, which
quarter I was persuaded was that of a cer-
tainty.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—You are asked a
simple question; did you yourself go to any
magistrate ?—-I went to no magistrate; but
was advised to go to another quarter, and I
went to that quarter.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I wish you would
not overpower the counsel or me with words.
You are asked a simple question, whether you
did, or not, go to a magistrate ?--I did not.

Mr. Erskine—Did you learn from your
friend, whose name I do not ask, whether he
had, in point of fact, laid from time to time,
the communications before a magistrate, that
you laid before him for that purpose ?—I gave
that information myself, .

Did you deliver yuur reports, from time to


time, to that quarter ; or did youdeliver them
immediately to some magistrate ?—I sent them
to that quarter.

When you say that, you mean you sent
them ta that person, to whom your friend
recommended you to send them ?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—He never said
that his friend advised him to a particular
person ; if he did I have mistaken him.

Mr. Erskine.—Did your friend advise you
to lay them before a particular person ?—He
xecommended me fo a particular quarter.

A quarter; was ita man or a woman?-—
That I cannot answer.

Mr. Erskine.—Not whether it was a man
ora woman.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Certainly not.

Mr. Erskine.—Was it to any particular pet-
son that you were advised, by your friend, to
make this communication or did he only ad-
vise you generally to make this communica-
tion, to somebody ?--The best way of expla-
nation is to say, that the person he recom-
mended me to, recommended me to a third

erson, and to that third person I gave the
information, and continued it all the way
through.

Mr. Justice Buller.—Mr. Erskine, you can-
not pursue that question farther.

Mr. Erskine.—How long was it after the
time when you were tried and acquitted, be-
fore you came to the society again?—-I at-
tended the society all the way through, though
not as a delegate—I was a delegate to Febru-
ary, 1794.

1 observe you do not take down who it was
that made use of any particular expressions ?
——In the course of the memorandums that I
have made, I have got names.

I know you have—in general in your book
you do not profess to have taken down the
words, but only the substance ?—Yes.

Ifa person delivered any opinion, which
opinion might be at some length, you made
the best abstract of it that you could, merely
to say that that was his opinion or his argu-
ment?—It is so; names are put toe some, and
not to others.

If any individual reported a paper, made an
observation, or made an argument, you took
down just an abstract of that, in your own
language ?—I did.

vere they taken down, bond fide to be re-
Ported as a delegate, or were they they taken
down for the purpose for which we have had
them here?—They were taken down for the
purpose of reporting as a delegate, and for the
other purpose too. :

Then it was perfectly boné fide, with regard
to the society, and, ut the same time, loné
fide with regard to the public?—Just so.

Have you made any alteration in your mi-
nutes since the time you made them ?~-I
have not; but I was going to say this, there
are some private memorandums that are in
this book, which do not belong to the society;
those private inemorandums are wrote at the


back of the society’s minutes; those are such
as, I think, it would be very impropor for me
to deliver up, and therefore I wish to know
what I am to do in that case.

Cannot you paste something over them ?--
I could do it, if I were allowed time.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—lIt is always
usual, and very reasonable it is, when a wit-
ness speaks from memorandums, that the
counsel should have an epee nity of looking
at those memorandums, when he is cross-ex-
amining that witness. If there is any thing
that you say, upon your oath, does not relate
to that subject, but some other subject, to be
sure it is impossible that it could be asked,

that that should be seen; how to arrange
that in a very long evidence, like this, is
among the difficulties of so ex i a

case as this is; we must struggle with it as well
as we can; whenever you are at’ leisure to go
through the subject with him, if he holds bis
yarers in his hands, you can ask him, as to
is minutes, if they could be separated by
pasting over, or if, with safety, by obliterat-
ing those parts——_—_— .
ynom.—lI could obliterate them with 3
pen sont talk, Dus these is no erasure, to my
nowledge, as they stand now. '

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Could you obli-
terate those memorandums which concern
other people, witha pen and ink ?---I could.

Lo Chief Justice Eyre.—Have you any
objection, Mr. Erskine, to his obliterating his
other memorandums with ink, you a
of him, upon oath, whether he has obli
any of those articles to which he spoke, when
he gave evidence?

r. Erskine-—None.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—In a common
case, it is the usual course, for the ceunsel to
take the memorandums in-his hand, for the
cross-examination, but, in this case, I do not
see how it is possible to do this ; this is a his-
tory, an im tt and material history, to be
sure, of the different branches of this society
as it is formed into divisions, aime by com-
mission of delegates for the whole; it has
so happened, that here are the transactions
both of the divisions, and of the delegates,
that are now laid before the jury ; of courseit
must run into great length; I cannot say into
more length than its importance requires ; we
are ready to do all that we can to assist yes,
consistently with not obliging him to discover
what does not relate to this cause.

Mr. Erskine—Am I to understand you
(and this is the only em I shall put wD
I see these minutes) do you mean to re-swear
that what you have read to-day, as minutes
taken at the time, are the same minotes
which you would have, bona fide, taken as 3
delegate, had you not had this otber view
which you have before described?—I will
swear that. ‘

And the other delegates were in the course
of taking similar memorandums *—Yes.

Lord Chiet Justice Eye. —I understood

him to say, that he did, in fact, make his re-
ports from these minutes; if he did not

make his report to the division from these |
minutes, he must have had another set of |

notes, for he must have made some, from the
nature of the thing; for they were to report
to the division every thing that passed among
the delegates, that did not come under the
head of secrecy, on the next day of holding
that division mecting ; therefore it must be
from some materials; consequently, if he has
dealt fairly with us, these are the minutes.
Mr. Erskine.—I shall only desire to look
at them in the morning ; perhaps I shall not

put any questions.

pier | Chief Justice Eyre—I should, if I
were in his case, put the book into your hand,
without any difficulty, stating the parts that
do not relate to this cause ;—then he will
take his minutes, and obliterate those parts
that do not relate to this cause against to-
morrow morning.

Mr. Maclean called again.

Mr. Attorney General,—Did you find that
paper [showing it to the witness] any where?
— Yes; I found it in the house of Mr. Adams.

[It was read.]

Extract of a Letter, dated Sheffield, 18th of
October, 1792, signed, “ The Editor of the
Patriot,” addressed to Mr. Andrews, secre-
tary to the Society of the Friends of Univer-
sal Peace, and the Rights of Man, at Stock-
port.

“It only remains then for us, secing the
great and innumerable difficulties we have to
encounter, to cast about for the most likely
and proper means and weapons by which to
detend ourselves, and to forward and support
such measures as it may be necessary to pur-
sue; and on this head, my good sir, permit
me to impress it on the minds of your society,
that reason, imperial reason, must ever be our

eneralissimo, or commander in chief; when
Tay this, I beg leave to add, that art must
be second in command ; by the word ‘ art,’
I do not mean craft or cunning, but that
mode of application of our reason and argu-
ments on different men, and on different oc-
casions, which only a considerable degree of
study, and practical knowledge also, of men
and manners, can ever furnish us with, so
as to make us proficients. .

“ Allow me then to observe to you, sir,
that 1 perfectly coincide with you in opinion,
with regard to the different societies appoint-
ing delegates to go into the different villages,
and country places, for the purpose of in-
forming their minds, and rousing them from
the lethargy in which they seem plunged. I
have already communicated the same idea to
the London Constitutional and Corresponding
Societies, and to those of Norwich and Man-
chester, and I hope it will soon be universally
adopted by every one. But the grand object


to. be attended to, on this head, is the chdice
of men to be appointed; a neglect of this
kind had iike to have had very awkward con-
sequences in this neighbourhood, and, if not
immediately checked, would have injured the
cause of freedom very greatly; infinite care
and circumspection will therefore be necessary
on this head.

“As I am on the subject, permit me to
suggest to those members of your society,
who may undertake this arduous, but ho-
nourable and praise-worthy task, that they
cannot be too cautious in their mode of
ceeding. The minds of men, for the wisest
and best purposes, are formed by the great
Creator as various and unlike each other as
their faces, and their passions reign over each
with the same uncertain and variegated
sway: and in the same manner that sir Ro-
bert Walpole (one of the elders and fathers
of corruption) very justly observed, that every
man has his price in the way of being hought;
so we may fairly apply the same maxim to
mankind in general, in the article of persua-
sion, and the dextrous method of bringing
them from wrong opinions they may have
formed, or prejudices they may have imbibed,
by anattentive observation of their mtellectual
faculties, and that leading passion of the sout
which governs the main spring of their most
material actions. For example, the generality
of farmers in this county and Lancashire, are
as ignorant as the brutes they ride to market,
and so absorbed in the sordid idea of getting,
that, provided they can keep up the prices of

rain, cattle, &c. so as to answer their land-
lords, and pay their taxes, however enormous,
they are too sluggish and indolent to thmk
about reforms, or any thing of the kind, yet
there is one string about their hearts, which,
being skilfully touched, will make them
dance to any time, and move to any measwre,
This is the subject of tythes ; why does
it touch them? Why sir? Because it is
within the scope of their limited capacity.
Ignorant as they are in other matters, they
see and pungently feel the weight of this
baneful and unjust devourer of all their im-
provements in agriculture and husbandry ;
and I believe, did every tax operate in the
same visible degree which this imposition
does, I fear there would be an end to the idea
of taxation being submitted to at all. Indeed,
as taxes are laid on, at present, by those who
do not represent us, the taxation is neither
more nor less than a robbery; a submission
to it, slavery.

“But to return to my subject. In the
same manner that a farmer may be roused by
the mention of tythes, the shoe-makers may
by the excessive dearness of leather, the inn-
keeper by the numerous and unnecessary
standing army, and all by a temperate and
dispassionate relation of the immense num-
ber of sinecure places, and useless offices, in
which the corrupt and prostitute favourites,
agents, and dependants of the rich and great,

riot in the spoils and plunder wrested from
the sweat of the brow, and continual labour
of the body of the husbandman, the mecha-
nic, the labourer, and the artificer. It is by
no means a difficult matter to raise general
indignation at the idea of so small a compa-
rative number of useless, idle, and profligate
drones, sucking and squandering away the
honey potincd by such immense numbers
of hard-toiling and industrious bees. If you
(for I am certain you will be one of the most
active of these-delegates) meet with men who
have violent prejudices in favour of any abuse
or party, never attack those prejudices directly,
for that will only inflame and confirm them
the more; pass them over fur the present,
and engage their attention towards something
else, in which they will listen with a less
degrce of apprehension of being attacked in
a favourite point; once gain their good api-
nion, and open their eyes to one evil, they
will be more ready to hear you on others;
till, at last, the favourite object by which
their cyes were jaundiced, will appear in its
true colours, and fall before your arguinents
like all the rest.

“ There is one thing above all others which
requires to be particularly attended to, and
that is, to endeavour to undcceive the mass
-of people, with respect to those falsehoods
which have been industriously propagated by
the enemies to a reform, in order to blind,
delude, and terrify all ranks of people: who
are any way independent, or possessed of
Property: One of these falschoods is, “ that
* the advocates of reform wish to introduce a
“levelling scheme, or an equal partition of
© property,’ This alarms the farmers, and
indeed all classes of men, who, by their in-
dustry, or other adventitious circumstances,
are possessed of the goods of this world. So
many vile ministerial prints as have propa-
gated this doctrine, aided and assisted by the
private representations, or rather misrepre-
sentations, of the clergy, and other tools of

overnment, and of privileged orders, have

da very wonderful and baneful effect on
the multitude, and have stamped a dread of
reform on the minds of many that I know,
whose situations in life would induce one rea-
sonably to suppose it impossible, so com-
pletely to impose upon them; however, it
always has been the case, that falsehoods,
boldly uttered, may prevail for a time, but
must be overwhelmed, in the end, by the
bright and sacred energies of truth.

“To explain this matter, and many others
properly, will require great coolncss, modera-
tion, and patience. I have found the tollow-
ing method answer best: ‘ Do you know
“such a gentleman?’ naming sume one of
large property and good character in the
neighbourhood, who is known to be a friend
to a reform; ‘ Yes.’—‘ Well, and do you sup-
* pose that he would promote a scheme that
€ would occasion and oblige him to part with
‘ property he possesses, in order for it to be di-


‘ vided amongst strangers whom he never saw
© or heard of ?’ ‘No’—* Why then should you
* suffer yourself to be imposed on by such aa
‘idle tale fabricated and calculated for the
‘purpose of raising a dread in you against
“those more enlightened of your fellow-citi-
“zens who wish for a reform, as yeu would,
“did you see its necessity; a dread which
“may cause you to shut your eyes upon op-
‘ pressive excise and game-laws, exorbitant
‘ tythes, an unnecessary standing army, kept
‘ on foot at the expense of two millions and a
half, for the purposes of influence and cor-
‘ruption; .a pension-list, which is a disgrace
‘to the government, and a stigma and re-
‘proach on the spirit and prudence of the
“nation ; sinecure places, for the mere pos-
“sessing of which, hundreds of individuals
‘receive thousands a year each, for duing
‘nothing at all, either for the public service
© or their own; in short, such an enormous
‘accumulation of taxes, and so prodigal an
‘ expenditure of their produce, as no nation
‘on the earth ever heard of or submitted to
* before. To make you shut your eves, and
‘continue blind to these enormities, those
‘idle and futile tales are villanously dispersed
“abroad ; but believe them not, consult your
© own reason, and it will show you that there
‘is a palpable lie on the face of every one of
‘them?’ Then explain the nature, aim, and
end of your society, mvite them to attend it,
and to judge for themselves: If they do so,
they will soon aid and assist you, by adopting
similar ones in their several neighbourhoods,
till, in time, they will overspread the whole
surface of this sca-girt isle.

* At present, sir, I will not trouble you
further on the subject, which 1 now quit tw
return to the conduct and regulatian of your
own society, and all others which may arise
hereafter; and as to them, I think the ina-
keepers in Stockport, Manchester, &c. have
given you a hint and lesson, for which you
ouglit to esteem yourselves for ever obliged
to them. I own their insolence and auda-
city in proceeding as they have done, is be-
yond example, but only deserying of con-
tempt; as such, leave them to themselves ;
public-houses were never worthy of receiving
such guests, whose sacred and important
duty require and demand to be performed in
mansions more dignified and respectable;
your meetings should be at the houses of one
-another in honourable rotatien ; and, to pree.
vent inconvenience frum too great a number,
not more than ten or twelve at the most
should compose a primary or district meet-
ing; more members may be admitted in each
district, till they reach twenty or twenty-four
according to the number fixed on—but thea
immediately should divide into two district:
meetings; the several districts should send
each one member, by election, to a meeting
of delegates, and this meeting of delegates
should elect out of their own body a certain
nuigber, which is to compose 3 select com:

mittee ; this select committee to manage the
correspondence, and every other important
concern for the whole of the districts in any
town or parish, subject always to the revision
and approbation of the districts; the dele-
gates and select committee to be chosen only
for a limited time, before the expiration of
which, others to be elected as betore, from
the districts, to supply their places, by which
rotations every member would in time be-
come qualified to be a delegate and a select
commnittce-man, though he might not be soon
his first entrance as a district member. These
are only hints on which you may improve or
enlarge as much as you please.”

Mr. Attorney General.—We will now read
a draft of an answer to this letter, which was
found likewise in the possession of Mr.
Adams; it has nodate; it has two hand-
writings init; I may, perhaps, trouble your
lordships, in the course of this cause, with
evidence to prove whose hand-writings they
are, but that is not necessary to enable me to
read it; 1 wish todraw your lordships atten-
tion particularly to the two last paragraphs.

Mr. Maclean.—\ found this paper at Mr.
Adams’s house.

[It was read]

“Gentlemen ;—The Society for Constitu-
tional Information have been favoured with
two letters bearing the signature of the editors
ofthe Patriot. The first of these letters, dated
June 11th, related particulars concerning the
publication called the Patriot, accompanied by
some of the first numbers. It required our
opinion, and our public approbation of the
work, with hints for its continuance. It like-
wise narrated several interesting particulars,
relative to the friends and foes of” liberty, their
various habits and propensities, and added
conjectures on the means by which those
habits and propensities might be turned to the |
advantage of freedom.

“ The second letter, dated October 15, con-
sisted of a complaint of neglect on the part of
our society, a farther statement of facts simi-
Jar to those contained in the first letter, and
an account including letters of the proceed- ;
ings of asocicty at Stockport.

. © All these letters have been read by the
society for Constitutional Information; and
the manly spirit in which they were con-
ceived, their honest zeal, and the love of free- |
dom by which their authors were animated, \
were highly grateful to chat society. It was
no fecling of superiority, no intentional disre-
Spect, and assuredly no wilful mark of insult,

at occasioned the silence of the society. We
were required to perform that of which we
were incapable ; to pass judgment on a pub-
lication which none of us had read, and to
correspond with persons in the dark, who had
not thought fit (for reasons which they no
doubt held to be prudent) to trust us with
their names, What could be due? We

t


admired both the talents and the intention of
our correspondents (or correspondent); but
we are simple, honest men, wanting the
priestly gift of intuition, and could not predi-
cate good or ill of that, of which, not having’
read, we could have no knowledge. Several
weeks passed away, and still the members
could give no opinion of the Patriot ; for men.
must individually act by their own judgments ;
itis the very essence of freedom that they
should be lett thus to act; they will read the
book first that happens most to attract their’
notice ; and you, gentlemen, are too liberal,
too just and too manly, to require them to
approve what they had not read, however de-
serving they might suspect it to be of appro--
bation. Of the purport, however, of your un-,
dertaking, the ardour with which it is con-
ceived, and the perseverance with which it,
appears to be pursued, the socicty finds no
hesitation in both approving and applauding
most zealously. ° F
“ You candidly ask the society for hints ;
but the detail of your letters convinces us you
are yourselves proficients. Honest men, how-
ever, advise, asked or not asked, whenever
they imagine that by advising they can do:
good. Perhaps, gentlemen, you may have
read and one a publication, by the
late father of his country, Dr. Franklin, called
poor Robin's almanack ; in which, with cha-
racteristic simplicity of language, he descended
to the feelings, wants and understandings of -
the lower order, and, in proverbial, jocular'
wisdom, conveyed truths to them of the highest:
importance, truths that prepared them for the
subline efforts to which they were soun to be‘
roused; truths that led them onward to the
avenuesof treedom, while their sight was too
feeble to endure the splendor of the temple
itself. A certain number of such proverbial
axioms, which men of your genius would-
easily invent, arranged at the beginning or
end of each of your publications, and appeal- -
ing to the real wants, grievances, and affeo-
tions of the people, of which you appear to be
perfectly masters, could not fail of producing
an effect. j
“ We rejoice with you in the increase of the
membersand societies of freedom : our bosoms »
glow with the same sentiments. Weare bro-
thers in aflection, with you, with the freemen
of Sheffield, of Stockport, and of the whole
woild.—Freedom, though an infant, makes .
herculean efforts ; and the vipers, aristocracy
and monarchy, are panting and writhing
under its grasp. May success, peace, and hap- -
piness attend those efforts. .
“ Permit us to add, that ‘the Society for
Constitutional Information will gladly receive -
or communicate intelligences, and for that .
purpose be happy to correspond ‘either with
other socicties or with individuals, that make |
the great and common cause of an equal and
real representation of the people in parlia-‘
ment, and the other grand objects of freedom, ;
their end. Information on such: subjects,
: \

will, to this society, at all times, be peculiarly
acceptable and gratifying.”

knife, which he meant to keep.

What was he to do with the rest P—I_ had
four back again.

_ When did you get those back ?.—I do not
recollect exactly the time.

How long was the whole package in the
prisoner's possession ?—I do not know exactly,
it was a very little time; 1 knew Mr. Hardy,

I bought shoes of him; I never booked them,

not many weeks.

He had them in his possession some weeks
then, had he ?—It might be two weeks; but
I cannot recollect.

Did you Nadu back before, or after he
was appre ended?—Just after he was appre-
hended. PP

Did you ever apply for them back again

had not been that way; and for that reason I
did not call to see whether he had made
choice of one, or not. a

different knives in this package?—I do not
know a material difference; they run nearly

about to shops, to show samples of particular
goods: this man called upon me; I gave him
an order for the goods; he sent them ac-

3H ; :

eorslng'y — Here are the bills of parcels for
hem,

How did you know he had knives of this
construction ?—He showed mea pattern; and
not only of that in particular, but of other
articles: I had seen the knives before, in
ditferent shops about town.

Where?—In the Strand; they are to be
seen at different public shops about town.

Did you apply to the prisoner to sell him
one, or did he apply to you to buy one ?—He
applied to me to buy one.

How did he know you had them ?—I do
not know that.

ing at Chalk Farm?—I was.

Were you at Chalk Farm meeting ?—I was,
part of the time.

I remember eating my supper, at Compton-
street with onc; and I remember one or two
making remarks upon it.

What were the remarks?—That it was a
very useful knife.

Did you see any more there?—I saw ano-
ther, which I looked upon to be a better
knife; that was in the hands of Mr. Pearce;
it was a better finished knife.

Did he tell you where he got it?—No, not
that I recollect.

Did he say any thing that he could do with
it ?—Not that I recollect.

Thomas Green cross-examined by Mr.
Erskine.

If this is worth pursuing, I would ask you
whether you have one of these knives here?—
Yes; I have one in my pocket—Here it is
{producing it.] .

Mr. Erskine.—Is this all?—Yes; I have
had one of the kind seven years, and used it
in my business.

And you sometimes cut a bit of meat with
it ?—Yes, and cheese, or any thing.

You had no intention to cut throats with it,
I hope ?—Never.

Mr. Attorney General.—How many of these
knives have you now ?—I have twenty left
out of three dozen.

Mr. Erskine.—Were those the same sort
of knives that you said you had seen in
various cutlers’ shops about town ?—Yes,

I think there is hardly a cutler’s shop in
town that has not such knives?—Very few
that are any thing of a cutler’s shop.

Are those knives any new discovery in the
ingenious age in which we live, or have they
been in use all your tims ?—They are no new
discovery ; I have used them seven years.

I ask you, upon your solemn oath, whether
there is any thing but what is common about
these knives, or whether you did not use them
in the common course of your trade, and
whether Mr. Hardy did not buy them as a
common customer ?—Yes.

And he happened to be taken up hefore
you got them back again?—-Yes,


It is a very useful knife; and I will buy
one of them the next time I see you---Do you
know Mr. Groves ?---I do, .

Had you ever any conversation with Mr.
Groves, about your having sold knives of that
description ?-—He came to me to purchase 3
knite at my shop, among other things; he
purchased several other articles at the same
time; he remarked the utility of the knife;
he said it was a very useful knife. ‘

Did you tell Groves that you had sold two
or three hundred of them ?---No.

You swear that?—I did not mention any
particular number; I remember he madea
remark in this kind of way, whether I had
sold a number of these knives, whether it was
a saleable article or no?---I said, yes.---No
man in business would tell a person that it
was not a saleable article; they would not
purchase it, if he did.

Did you tell him that you had sold two or
three hundred, but desire him to speak low,
because the parlour-door was open, and your
wife was a damn’d aristocrat—did you say so?
---I_will make oath that I did not make use of
such an expression as that.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---What was the
expression you did make use of?—-I do not
know exactly what, but not such a one as
that; no man has ever heard me swear an
oath in that kind of way these seven years;
I might make use of an expression in this
kind of way, when he asked me if it wasa
saleable article, and if I sold a uantity of
them, I might say yes, it is a saleable article,
or to that purpose, but I did not say that I
had sold any particular number.

Mr. Erskine.—Did you say any thing
him as if there was any thing improper in
selling the knives ?—-No,

Did you desire him to speak low lest it
should be heard by others, that you were selh

ing acommon article in your shop?—Not at

You swear that?-~I do.

I think it right to inform you, that Groves
has thought fit to swear you told him to speak
very low, for that your parlour-door was open,
and your wife was a damn’d aristocrat, and
that you did not want her to know that you
you were selling these knives ?—I swear I said
ho such thing; these knives all lay open in
my shop, so far from hiding them from my
wife, or from any man in the parish, thatthey
lay openly in the show-glass, and in the win-
dow for sale.

Would you have sold a knife of any sort or
description, to any man that you had the
least idea was intended to be made use of il-
legally or unjustly ?—Not if I knew it was
intended to be made use of for that purpose.

Did you bespeak these knives for the purpose
of selling them to mischievous people, or in
the ordinary course of your trade?—In the or-
dinary course of my trade. .

‘Then I understand you to swear positively,
it is not true what Groves has sworn concer;

ing you?—What he has sworn I do not know,
‘but that Idid not make use of such an ex-
pression, I swear positively.

Thomas Green re-examined by Mr. Attorncy-
‘ General.

To be sure, it is not a polite thing to call
one’s wife a damn’d aristocrat, what did you
“say about her?—I do not recollect that I said
a word of the kind, or throw out any such
hint.

- Did you say any thing about your wife?—I
do not recollect, to the best of my knowledge,
that I mentioned any thing about my wife.
“Did you mention any t ing about aristo-
crat?—No, I do not know t at I said any
thing about aristocrat, or my wife.

_ Mr. Erskine.—Did you wish to conceal sell-
ing these knives from your wite?—No.

Edward Hodson sworn.—Examined by Mr.
: Law,

Look at these papers—were they printed by
you?—I beg leave, with submission to the
Court, to know, whether I am bound to ao-
swer that question ?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—lt depends upon
what the nature of the paper is; you are not
bound to answer any question that may tend
to criminate yourself.

Mr. Law.—Certainly it is a paper of a
seditious tendency—it was opened by Mr.
Attorney-General, as @ description of the
Ins and Outs, advising the people to pro-
vide themselves with arms. Without saying
whether you published it, did you receive
from any body, any application or any re

uest to print a paper of those contents?—I
fo not ask you whether you did print it or
not.—I had.

From whom?—A person of the name of
FPiodgson.

- Where doos he live?—I never was in his
hhouse—I was informed he lived at Westmin-
ster.

‘When were you applied to ?—I presume it
must be about the month of March last.

Mr. Law.—Hodgson has been already prov-
ed to bea member of the Corresponding So-
ciety.

[od Chief Justice Eyre.—What was it he
brought to you, a printed paper, or a manu-
script?—A manuscript.

Mr. Law.—A manuscript copy of that paper
which I have now shown you ?—Yes.

[The printed paper read.]

© The Ins tell us we arein dangerof invasion
from the French.

“The Outs tell us that we are in danger
from the Hessians and Hanoverians.

Tn either case we should arm ourselves ;
get arms, and Jearn how to use them.”

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Can you fix the
time when it was brought to you ?—I presume
about the month of March.

Edward Hodson, —cross-examined by Mr.
. Gi ‘

ibbs.

_ Were you a member of either of these so-
cieties?——-A member of the London Corres-
ponding Society.

How long have you been a member of it?
—I presume I was a member about three
months—then I ceased to be a member.

When did you cease to be amember ?—Im-
mediately upon the report that the society had
improper objects in view.

‘At what time was that ?—About the month
of April, on the first apprehension, I believe,
of the prisoner and Mr. Adams; I never went
to the society afterwards.

Have you any reason to think, during the
time you were a member of the society, that
they had any other objects but a parliamentary
reform ?—Never.

You never had ?—Never.

In what House of Parliament ?—In the
Commons House of Parliament.

Had you any idea that it was any part of
their plan to attack the king ?—Far from it.

In any sd seh lessen his authority in the
state?—Far from it; I never heard any thing
of the kind started directly nor indirectly.
Had you any reason to suspect that they
meant to displace the Lords from any autho-
rity they possess in the state ?—None at all ;
I am sure I should not have continued with
them a moment longer if I had.

Did you cease to be a member of the socie-
ty from any thing that you observed yourself, or
was it from Mr. Hardy and Mr. Adams being
taken up?—Intirely from Hardy and Adams
being taken ups and the reports in circulation,
that, under the pretence of a reform, they
were pursuing other objects.

Did you attend the society often?—No; I
did not by any means, for my business would
not admit of it, and a part of the three months
that I was a member I was indisposed and
confined to my room.

However, during the whole time you did
attend it, this was what you collected to be
their object ?—Exactly.

They have been ta king of a convention ;
had you any idea in the society, or did you
hear from any of the society, that that con-
vention was to take upon itself the function
of legislature, was to make laws ?—At the
time 1 was in the society, I always understood
when they were talking of aconvention, as a
thing by no means determined on; that they
wished to take the sense of different societies
in the country, whether such a measure was
adviseable, the assembling a convention.

But had you any idea that any body of men
were to be called together, who were to take
from King, Lords, and Commons, the power
of making laws, and were themselves to make
laws for them?—Oh—by no means, there
was not the least shadow to form such an opi-
nion from.

Did you ever hear any conversation from

any ofthe members, tending that way ?—Ne- |

ver in my life.

Had you any idea from any thing you ever
heard, that there was an intention in this, or
any of these societies, to introduce the anar-
chy of France into England ?—No,

You had not ?—No; I had not.

When was this hand-bill brought to you ?—
I believe in the month of March or April; I
am not accurate as to the time; it must be
about that time, for I did not become a mem-
ber of the society till the month of February,
I believe.

Edward Hodson re-examined by Mr. Attorney-
General.

You did not know what passed at the Globe
tavern then ?—No.

All you know is, what passed between the
month of February and the time of the appre-
hension of Hardy and Adams ?—That is all

Then you chose to protect your own cha-
racter, hearing of those reports, by remaining
no longer in the society? your knowledge is
only since the meeting at the Globe-tavern ?
—Yes. :

You were at Chalk-farm?-—I was.

Did you ever read the resolutions that pass-
ed at Chalk-farm?-—I have read them in the
Teport.

You had read them before you saw them in
the report?—~-Yes.

Where?—I had seen them in the printed
account of the proceedings at Chalk-farm.

Had you seen the printed account of the
proceedings on the 20th of January ?-~I had
not; I do not recolJect that I have read them
to this hour.

Did you know that they had had any thing
todo with Mr, Paine’s works, “The Rights
of Man?”——I never knew that but by hear-
say.

“Were you applied to to print the proceed-
ings at Chalk-farm? Ido not ask you whe-
ther you printed them.-~I was applied to.

By whom?-—-By several of the members, not
by an individual member ; I was at the divi-
sion, the committee division, as it was termed,
and it being determined to priut them, I was
applied to.

Mr. Attorney-General.--My lords, I am
Now going to prove, that the circular letter of
Mr. Hardy, which your lordships heard read,
telative to the calling a convention, was sent
to Edinburgh and Strathaven; that it was
answered from Strathaven by a letter ; I shall
also prove the transactions which passed re-
specting it at Edinburgh, and having proved
those cxciiisatices, 1 shall then state the
grounds upon which I Bpecetend it will be
open to me to prove other transactions in
Scotland. ;

pe 659, 931, and 1950 and p. 55, of this Vo-
ume,


(840 |
Where is your place of residence?-—In Edim- |

gh.
Were you a member of any society im
Edinburgh at any time ?—I suppose you mean
the Friends of the People.

You were a member of the society, calling
itself the Friends of the People ?---Yes.

When did you commence a member of thad
society ?---I believe it was some time about
the end of the year 1793.

Were you at any time a member of any
meeting or society, which was called the Br-
tish Couvention?—Yes, I was.

When did you become a member of that
convention ?--I do not recollect at what time
the convention was held.

Were you deputed to the convention as 3
delegate from your society ?-—Yes, I was.

Can you tell us at what time that delega-
tion took place?—I made a mistake at first;
it was at the end of the year 1792 that I was
made a member, and at the end of 1793 the
British Convention was held.

So that you were a delegate from your
society ?—Yes.

Do you know at what time you were ap-
inited, a delegate to the convention?—I
think it was at the end of November, or the
beginning of December 1793.

Did you attend any of the meetings of the
British Convention at Edinburgh ?—Several
of them.

Were there delegates at the meetings of
that convention from other societies in Scot-
land?---There were.

From any other parts besides Scotland,
south ?~-Yes, there were some from England.

Were you at any time a member of the
London Corresponding Society ?~-No.

Do you remember, at any time, receiving
any letter similar to that which I now put
into your hand (showing a letter to the wit-
ica a did receive some letter similarto
this.

Among those which you received, did you
receive the identical letter that I have put into
your hand? if you look, you will see your owg
writing on it.---Yes, I think this is the letter
that I sent into the country.

What number of letters did you receive
with that, which were of a similar tendency?
—I think about halfa dozen.

Whom did you receive them from ?—From
one Mr. Stock, in Edinburgh.

Was he a member of any of the societies in
Edinburgh ?—Yes.

Of which?---One that met in Simmond's-
square, Nicholson street, on the south-side of
Edinburgh. .

What particular name had it?—I do not
know what it was called; it was a sociel
exactly of the same nature with that of w:

I was a member.

Was there in that society to which you and
Stock belonged, any committee which was
known by any particular name?—There was
no committee belo to that individual
society that I particularly belonged to.

‘

Having received five or six of these letters
from Stock, what did you do with them?—I
sent several of them into the country. —

Look at the superscription to that in your
hand, and tell me where that was sent to ?—
It was sent to a person of the name of Miller,
at Perth.

Name some other places to which you sent
this letter ?—I sent one to Strathaven.

Any other?—I think I sent one to Paisley,
and to some other towns in the country.

Did you send any to Dundee P—I am not

certain whether I did or not.

‘ou told me you attended several meetings
of the British Convention, as it was called ; be
so good as tell us any of the preening: of
the British Convention, at which you were

resent; had you any icular cause of

owledge? did you write any of the minutes

of the meeting P—I took some of the minutes
of the meeting of the convention.

Did you act as secretary of the convention,
upon those occasions ?~--Now and then; some-
times I did.

Without troubling you with the whole of
the proceedings which we have had already;
do you remember any particular resolution,
which was with any extraordinary so-
lemnity, at the convention ?—I do not recol-
lect particularly; I would know them to be
parts of the minutes of the convention that I
wrote myself, if I saw them.

Ifin the minutes of the convention, you
should see itin your own band-writing, you
would know it again ; but what I am speaking
of, is not there; was there any resolution
passed with extraordinary solemnity, such as
ising up and taking one another by the hand,
or any thing of that kind ?---I recollect some-
thing of that kind having happened, but I do
not face what it was.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---Were you there
when it happened ?--I am_not very certain
whether I was or not, but I recollect being
questioned upon that very circumstance upon
the trials at Edinburgh, but I cannot be posi-
tive at present upon the circumstances what
it was.

Were you present at any time when any
resolution was passed with extraordinary so-
lemnity, such as extending the hand (the
mode of swearing I believe in Scotland), or by
taking one another by the hand. Do you
recollect such a circumstance, with respect to
any resolution ?—] do not recollect it.

Do you recollect the dispersion of the
British Convention, by the magistracy of the
country ?---I was not present at the frst dis-
persion ; I was in custody then. . .

Do you remember the fact of the dispersion
of the convention ?---Yes, .

After that do you know of forming any
committees of ways and means, or any thing
of that sort?—-After the dispersion of the con-
vention, I did not act in the societies myself,
but I understood-

I do not ask you what you understood.—
Then I do not know.


Do you know of the formation of any com-
mittee of union, which met in your own
house ?—I cannot swear positively ; it became
the common talk, but Twas not present at
one, and was not privy to their proceedings.

Though you were not yourself present at
any of their meetings, did you from any of the
persons who were members of the British
Convention before its dispersion, learn that
there had been a committee of union formed;
did you learn that after the dispersion of the
convention from any of the members of the
convention ?—I understood there was a com-
mittee.

Did you understand that from any of the
members of the convention which had been
dispersed ?—I cannot be certain to that, but I
understood there was a committee.

Mr. Garrow.---My lords, we will now read
this letter which this witness says he received
from Stock ; we have produced a large bundle
of these circular letters to country correspon-
dents, which were found in the possession of
the prisoner.

This letter was transmitted by the witness
to Miller, at Perth, and he says he sent other
copies to different places in the country, par-
ticularly to Strathaven ; your lordships recols
lect that an answer to that sent to Strathaven,
has been read.

[The printed circular letter read.]

“ Citizens ;—The critical moment is arrived,
and Britons must either assert with zeal and
firmness their claims to liberty, or yield with-
out resistance to the chains that ministerial
usurpation is forging for them. Will you co-
Operate with us, in the only peaceable mea-
sure that now presents itself with any prospect
of success? We need not intimate to you,
that notwithstanding the unparalleled auda-
city of @ corrupt and overbearing faction,
which at present tramples on the rights and
liberties of the people, our meetings cannot in
England be interrupted, without the previous
adoption of a convention bill—a measure it is
our duty to anticipate, that the ties of union
may be more firmly drawn, and the senti-
ments and views of the different societies
throughout the nation be compared, while it
is yet In our power, so as to guide and direct
the future operations of the friends of freedom.
Rouse then, to one exertion more ! and let us
show our consciousness of this important truth,
“Ifwe are to be beaten down with threats,
prosecutions, and illegal sentences, we are
unworthy—-we are incapable of liberty..—We
must, however, be expeditious. Hessians and
Austrians are already among us; and if wc
tamely submit, a cloud of these armed barba-
rians may shortly be poured in upon us. Let
us form then another British Convention; we
have a central situation in our view, which,
we believe, would be most convenient for the
whole island ; but which we forbear to men-
tion (entreating your confidence in this parti-
cular) till we have the answer of the societics

any ofthe members, tending that way ?—Ne- |

ver in my life.

Had you any idea from any thing you ever
heard, ihat there was an intention in this, or
any of these societies, to introduce the anar-
chy of France into England ?—No.

You had not ?—No ; I had not.

When was this hand-bill brought to you ?—
I believe in the month of March or April; I
am not accurate as to the time; it must be
about that time, for I did not become a mem-
ber of the society till the month of February,
I believe.

Edward Hodson re-examined by Mr. Attorney-
General.

You did not know what passed at the Globe

All you know is, what passed between the

cecd to business.”—-Upon your oath, were
not you present when that resolution was
come to?—-I think I was.

Mr. Garrow.—Attend to this---“ The con-
vention doth hereby resolve, that each dele-
gate, immediately on his return home, do
convene his constituents, and explain to them
the necessity of electing a delegate, or dele-
gates, and of ssiahliacing a fund, without
delay, against any of these emergencies, for
his or their expense; and that they do in-
struct the said delegate or delegates, to hold
themselves ready to depart at one hour's
warning.” Now I fancy [ have brought you
to recollect this?--I du recollect that Ban
your reading it. :

Now attend---No persons were members of
this society but persons of moral life and con-
versation; respectable, orderly, and decent
citizens, I think you told that gentleman?.--
That was not my answer to the question ; he
asked me if there were not reputable trudes-
men belonging to that society ?—I said, yes.

So you understood. that question to be,
whether there were not some reputable trades-
men belonging to that society?—Yes.

Was Watt* a member of that society ?—
No.

Was Downie t+?—He was.

As you have told that gentleman, upon
your cross-examination, that you took the
intention to be to proceed by peace and
order:

Mr. Gibbs.—I submit to your lordship that
that is improper. That sort of interlarding a
a question is not permitted to us even in cross-
examination.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I perfectly agree
with you. It is an habitual irregularity; I
state that as a common excuse for it all, asa
thing to be corrected as much as wecan. I
did not expect we should get right in a mo-
ment; let us keep as much within bounds as
we can; it disturbs the argument of the exa-
mination entirely, when it is so filled with
these observations.

Mr. Garrow.—I am much obliged to your
lordship for the kindness with which the ad-
monition comes, and for my part, I will en-
deavour to submit myself immediately to it.—
Were you there when it was resolved, “ That
the moment of any illegal dispersion of the
present convention, shall be considered asa
summons to the delegates to repair to the
place of meeting appointed for the conven-
tion of emergency, by the secret committee :
and that the secret committee be instructed
to proceed, without delay, to fix the place of
meeting?”—I think I was present at that
meeting.

Mr Erskine.—It is stated that the moment

with which we are in correspondence. Let
us have your answer then by the 20th, at
farthest, earlier if possible, whether you ap-
-prove of the measure ; and how many dele-
gates you can send, with the number also, if
possible, of your societies. We remain your's,
in civic affection, the London Corresponding
Society, T. Harpy, secretary.

“ For the management of this business we
have appointed a secret committee. You will
judge, how far it is necessary for you todo the
same.”

Addressed on the back
« Mr. Walter Miller, merchant, Perth.”

. “ Show this to your neighbours.”

“ Answer, post paid, to the care of George
Ross, Liberty Court, Edinburgh.”

« Thegazetteer is tocomce out immediately.”

“Nothing but ready money subscriptions
received.”

* George Ross cross-examined by Mr. Erskine.

What was the object of your society, the

Friends of the People?—To procure a reform
in parliament; a reform in the House of
Commons.
« Did your objects extend farther than to a
reform in the House of Commons ?—It was
only the House of Commons that I associated
to reform.

Had your society any design, from what you
collected from the members of it, and from
what was said and done in your presence, to
attack the king’s person, or his prerogative, or
state ?—I never thought so.

Was it your object in that association to do
so?—My object was to procure a reform in
the House of Commons.

You I think were made a delegate from
your society to the British Convention ?—Yes,

When you met together, the delegates from
the different societies in your convention, did
you consider yourselves as the parliament of
Great-Britain ?—No not at all. We meant to
consider the proper means of petitioning par-
liament.

Was any thing done, or said, by the dele-
gates, situng in the convention, as if they had
assumed to themselves the authority and
functions of magistracy?—I could conceive
no such thing.

Did they exercise any functions of legislative,
or executive power ?—No such thing.

Was there any thing said by any members
against the king ?—Not that 1 know of; not
that I heard.

Did you make any laws to bind the people?
—We should have been very foolish if we had
proposed such a thing.

What appeared to you to be the object ?—
To procure a reform in the Commons House
of Parliament.

- How were you to do it ?—By a petition.

Was that said aniong the members of the
convention ?—Yes ; and several petitions were


sent previous to the meeting of the British
Convention.

What number did the British Convention
consist of ?—About two hundred.

Had you provided yourselves with arms to
attack the magistracy and government of the
country ?—We had not.

Were the delegates prepared to resist the
magistracy by force ?—Not at all; when the
magistrates came to disperse the British Con-
vention the second day, they did not resist
them when the sheriff showed his authority ;
he took the chairman by his hand and tock
him out of the chair; he said he was doing
nothing illegal, gnd would not leave the
chair ull the sheriff took him forcibly out.

If you had considered that you were duing
that which was illegal and dishonourable for
a subject to do, should you have done it !—
No; we should have refrained from it.

Should you have done it if you had thought
it likely to be dangerous to the king's go-
vernment or person ?—No; I never meant
any such thing, I had no such intention.

Do you think there were any other persons
in your society who meant any such thing ?—
I never did; for it was always understucd,
that our society was to obtain a reform ia
parliament. ’

What sort of persons did the convention
consist of ?—There were people of all ranks
belonging to the societies, most of the poor
class.of people. ©

Were there any reputable tradesmen be-
longing to it?—Yes; there were some very
reputable gentlemen among them.

People of good character, sober lives, and
morals ?—Most of them were men of sober
lives and morals.

Was there any proposition made in the
convention, in your presence, during the time
you attended it, that led to assuming any
authority of your own?—No; we never
thought of any such thing.

George Ross re-examined by Mr. Garrow.

It would not have occurred to me to ask
you, whether you were a traitor, or your as-
sociates declared themselves to be so.—Now
I will put some questions to you, upon
what you have been asked. You have told
that gentleman that you had no idea of as-
suming the powers of legislation by force ?—
No ideas of that at all.

You meant merely to procure, or obtain, if
you could, a reform in the representation of
the people ?—You are very right.

And that by peaceable means ?—Yes.

And that you would have shuddered at an
idea of force, or resistance to the civil power
of the country ; dol take you right?—Yes ;
very right.

You had no idea of going farther than a
fair, peaceable, and orderly application for a
redress of that which you conceived to be
wrong ?—I will answer for: myself; I had
not.

Were you present when that convention
came to this resolution ? and then the pro-
per constitutional judges will say, whether
you meant it or not :

“That this convention, considering the
calamitous consequences of any act of the le-
gislature which may tend to deprive the whole,
or any part of the people, of their undoubted
right to meet, either by themselves, or by de-
legation, to discuss any matter relative to
their common interest, whether of a public
or private nature, and holding the same to be
totally inconsistent with the first principles
and safety of society, and also subversive of
our known and acknowledged constitutional
liberties, do hereby declare, before God and
the world, that we shall follow the wholesome
example of former times, by paying no regard
to any act which shall militate against the
constitution of our country, and shall con-
tinue to assemble and consider of the best
means by which we can accomplish a real re-
presentation of the people, and annual elec-
tion, until compelled to desist by superior
force.”’—Did you know that the convention,
of which you were a member, ‘who sought all
those things by peaceful and orderly means,
had come to that resolution ?—I am not cer-
tain whether ever that resolution was passed
in the convention.

Upon your oath, were not you present
when it was proposed?—I do not recollect
that it was proposed.

Will you swear you were not present ?—I
cannot be certain, because the convention
met for several weeks, I believe; andI cannot
be certain whether I was present, if that was
passed at it, or no.

Can you say you were not present when such
a resolution was passed?---I cannot answer
positively to the question, on account of the
convention meeting for two or three weeks,
and I could not get to attend it every day for
all the time that the committee met, but I
commonly attended two or three hours of
every day. I cannot recollect all the difterent
motions that were moved and passed in the
convention, whether I was present at them or
not.

I will remind you of some others that will
strike your memory better perhaps-—“ And
we do resolve, That the first notice given for
the introduction of a convention bill, or any
bill of a similar tendency to that passed in
Ireland, in the last session of their parliament,
or any bill for the suspension of the Habeas
Corpus act, or the ‘Act for preventing
£ wrongous imprisonment, and against undue
§ delays in trials in North Britain ;’ or in case
of an invasion, or the admission of any foreign
troops whatsoever into Great-Britain or Ire-
Tand ; all, or any of these calamitous circum-
stances, shall be a signal to the several dele-
gates to repair to such place as the secret com-
mnittee of this convention shall appoint; and
the first seven members shall have power
to declare the sittings permanent, and twenty-


one shall constitute a convention, and pro-
ceed to business.”—-Upon your oath, were
not you present when that resolution was
come to?—-I think I was.
* Mr. Garrow.—Attend to this-—“ The con-
vention doth hereby resolve, that each dele-
gate, immediately on his return home, do
convene his constituents, and explain to them
the necessity of Beene a delegate, or dele-
tes, and of establishing a fund, without
lelay, against any of these emergencies, for
his or their expense; and that they do in-
struct the said delegate or delegates, to hold
themselves ready to depart at one hour's
warning.” Now I fancy Ihave brought you
to recollect this?-—I dv recollect that from
your reading it. :

Now attend---No persons were members of
this society but persons of moral life and con
versation ; respectable, orderly, and decent
citizens, I think you told that gentleman?.-.
That was not my answer to the question ; he
asked me if there were not reputable trades-
men belonging to that society ?—I said, yes.

So you understood that question to be,
whether there were not some reputable trades-
men belonging to that society?—Yes.

Was Watt* a member of that society P—
No.

Was Downie t?—He was.

As you have told that gentleman, upon
your cross-examination, that you took the
Intention to be to proceed by peace and
order:

Mr. Gibbs.—I submit to your lordship that
that is improper. That sort of interlarding a
a question is not permitted to us even in cross-
examination.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I perfectly agree
with you. It is an habitual irregularity; £
statc that as a common excuse for it all, as a
thing to be corrected as much as wecan. I
did not expect we should get right in a mo-
ment; let us keep as much witbin bounds as
we can; it disturbs the argument of the exa-
mination entirely, when it is so filled with
these observations.

Mr. Garrow.—I am much obliged to your
lordship for the kindness with which the ad-
monition comes, and for my part, I will en-
deavour to submit myself immediately to it.—
Were you there when it was resolved, “ That
the moment of any illegal dispersion of the
present convention, shall be considered asa
summons to the delegates to repair to the
place of meeting appointed for the conven-
tion of emergency, by the secret committee :
and that the secret committee be instructed
to proceed, without delay, to fix the place of
meeting ?”—I think I was present at that
meeting.

Mr Erskine.—It is stated that the moment

any of those things were communicated, they
were to be a signal for your holding a con-
vention at such a place ?—Yes.

But what were you todo when you got to-
gether in this convention ?—To petition par-
Niament to get those grievances redressed.

Mr. Garrow.—That gentleman has asked
you, what you were to do when you should
be got together upon the summons of the
delegates. Do you mean to state, upon

your oath, that you had the least apprehen- ,

sion that that meeting, in a Convention of
Emergency, summoned by a secret com-
mittee of emergency, was for the purpose of
again petitioning parliament ?—I would never
have agreed tu the motion upon any other
terms.

Do you mean to state, upon your oath, that

ou understood that the resolution which I
ve read to you, and which I will read again
—“ That we shall follow the wholesome ex-
amp!c of former times, by paying no regard to
any act which shall militate against the con-
stitution of our country, and shall continue
to assemble and consider of the best means
by which we can accomplish @ real represen-
tation of the people, and annual election,
until compelled to desist by superior force.” —
Do you mean to swear that you understood
that to be to meet in such convention for the
pas of again petitioning parliament?—I
ad no other idea.

Do you mean to state, that you understood
that to be the meaning of such a meeting in a
Convention of Emergency?—I understood it
to be that some people should be authorized

to call a meeting whenever any of those cir-
cumstances should take place, and the in
tention of the meeting would be that of peti-
tioning parliament.

That the delegates were to hold themselves
in readiness to depart at an hour’s warning,
for the purpose of again petitioning that par-
liament, which they had already petitioned
without success ?

Mr. Gibbs.—The convention never had pe-
titioned parliament.

Mr. Attorney General.—It has been dis-
tinctly proved in evidence, that these Scotch
societies had stated that more effectual means
should be used.

Mr. Gibbs.— Mr. Garrow states that the ob-
ject was to petition again that parliament which
the convention had before petitioned without
effect—Now I am not aware that the conven-
tion had petitioned parliament.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—It is not a sub-
ject to be debated, but it is perfectly clear that
just in the manner in which the question was
put, the fact was not stated. *

Mr. Garrow.—-Do you mean to represent
to the Court and the Jury, that you under-
stood that the delegates were to hold them-
selves in readiness to assemble upon an hour’s
Notice, in order to petition parliament upon
the dispersion of the convention ?---I_under-
stood that the delegates, whenever they got


information that a convention was necessary
to be held, that they should immediately re-
pair to a place appointed.

Do you mean again to state that you un
derstood the purpose of that second con-
vention, after the dispersion of the first, was
to petition parliament?—-That is what I
mean.

Let me see whether I understand you dis-
tinctly, for God forbid E should misunderstand
you, or endeavour to misrepresent you—You

‘ understood that the convention of emergency,

which was to be collected by the committee
of emergency upon an hour's notice, was tr
petition parliament ?—I never would have
agreed to the meeting of any convention, if
they meant to oppose parliament; and I
understood that if there was a convention
called again, that they certainly would peti-
tion parliament for redressing the supposed
grievances which existed. . .

For what purpose, after the dispersion of
the existing convention, was a new conven-
tion of emergency to be called by a committee
of emergency, to petition parliament, as you
understood it ?—I understood they would pe-
tition parliament, that although their petiton
was rejected, they would still continue, they
would not throw aside the notion of a parlis-
mentary reform merely from the rejection of
@ petition or two, .

So that though the first petition should be
rejected, and the convention dispersed by
force, yet you understood there was to bea
committee of emergency. to call a new con-
vention of emergency, and so & on i
petitioning, though they should have ther
petitions again rejected (—1 understood that
the Friends of the People meant to petition
parliament till they should gain their end.

Then why did not the society of the
Friends of the People go on petitioning per-
liament, without sending delegates to a British
Convention for the purpose of effecting these
reforms ?—One of the Teasons for that was, it
was noticed thata petition for parliamentary re-
form did not specify any particular reform, and
that was one of the reasons for a convention as
I understood if, to specify the particular re-
form in their petitions that they wanted, and
likewise.

And likewise what?—I do not recollect
what I was going to say.

Arthur M‘Ewan* sworn.—Examined by Afr.

Garrow.

Where is your place of residence ?—At the
Water of Leith. _

Were you a delegate at the British Conven-
tion, which assembled at Edinburgh ?—Yes.

Did you attend the meetings of that con-
vention ?—Sometimes.

Wore there any committees for the purpose
of managing the business of this convention ?
J believe there were.

Are you now sworn according to the man-
mer in which you usually take an oath?—No. |

e witness was sworn holding up his right
hand, while the oath was repeated, instead
of the usual form.)

You were a delegate of the British Conven-
tion assembled at Edinburgh ?—Yes.

Were there any committees of the conven-
tion for the purpose of managing its busi-
ness ?—I believe there were.

Did they from time to time report to the
convention itself?— As to that Ido not re-
member.

Do you remember the circumstance of the
convention being dispersed by the magis-
trates ?—Yes.

After the convention was dispersed, do you
semember any committec being formed out of
the societies ?—Yes. ;

What was the name of it?—There was a
large coramittee assembled, as I saw by hand-
bills, that went under the name of the Com-
snittee of Union.

Of what persons was that Committee of
Union composed ?—I cannot mform you as to
the names.

Was it composed of members of the con-
vention which had bcen dispersed ?—-Some of
them were, I believe some were not, at least
for aught I know.

Were those who, as far as you know, were
not members of the former convention, mem-
bers of the Society of the Friends of the People
at Edinburgh ?—I cannot say that, becquse I
was not formerly acquainted with them.

Was there any other committee, called a
Committee of Ways and Means ?--There was
another committce chosen out of the large
one, which went under the name of a Sub-
committee, and after that it was styled in a

inted paper a Committee of Ways and

Ieans; but who made it out in that form I
know not.

Of that committee which was called the
Committee of Ways and Means, who were the
members?—Mr. Stock, Mr. Bourke, Mr.
Aitcheson, Mr. Bonthron, Mr. Downie, Mr.
Watt, and myselfi

Do you remember Watt, as a member of
that Committee of Ways and Means, reading
any plan for the purpose of effecting some
mischief at Edinburgh ?—Yes, I do.

You had been a member of the British
Convention?—Yes.

What was the plan which was read in she
Committee of Ways and Means by Mr. Watt,
one of the delegates, and who was a member
of that committee ?—The purport of what he
read from the paper, as I think, can thus, that
it was———

Attend to me a single moment—do you
know for what purpose, in particular, you
were assembled at the time that this plan was


— ee


rend—was it for answering any letter ?—Da
you know for what purpose this sub-commit-
tee was chosen ?—The reason of choosing this
sub-committee, as far as I cam understand it,
was, to look into the circumstances of Mr.
Skirving; for this reason, that a fortnight
before there was a letter read that came from
him by a man on that large committee, inti-
matiag that there was due to him, from the
Friends of the People, twenty pounds, atid he
wished they would make good that payment
to support his wife and family when he had
left the land; that was what I conceived the
committee was appuinted for. ; .

Ia that Committee of Ways and Means,
was there any letter which had come to the
society, or any of its members, which pure
ported to be a circular letter which you were
then met to answer? Leok at+his letter, was
this letter produced in the Committee of.
Ways and Mecans?—If it was, it was not in
my presence, I never saw it.

At a Committee of Ways and Means, Watt
read a plan?—Yes. | ;

State what that plan was which Watt read
in the Committee of Ways and Means ?—As
far as F can recollect, the plan ran in this way—
it was mentioned there to seize the lord justice
clerk of Scotland, and the rest of the lords of
council and session, and the lord provost of
Edinburgh; and it also mentioned to kindle
a fire at the Excise-office in the New Town,
and there were to be parties, according to the’
way that he read that paper; there were to
be parties stationed at the Luckenbooths.
* Mr. Erskine—Msr. Attorney Gencral, £
wish to know im whet way you make this
evidence?

Mr. Altorney General.—It is due from me
to state to your lordships how I shape the
case. We have now, as your lordships recol-
lect, proved by a letter on the 17th of May,
1793, from Mr. Hardy, by @ Mr. Urquhart,
who was then going to Ediaburgh, that he
sent this proposition to the Convention a
Edinburgh, to associate not only that society
with the London Corresponding Seciety, but
both with every other society throughout the
nation—that in answer to that, Mr. Skirving,
who appears to be the secretary, in a lettor
which was found in the possession of the pri-
soner states—“ If either you in England, or
we in Scotland, should ateempt separately the
reform which we seek to obtain, we should,
by so doing, only expose our weakness, and
manifest our ignorance of the corruption
which opposes our important undertaking.—
If we sought only the extirpation of one set of
nieces teil men frony the management of
national affairs, that place might be given to
another set, without affecting the vitals ad-
verse to the system of reform.”—It then states
in general, that they must have the whole,
and not a part—and then he desires that there
might be a general union of the people them-
selves; he says—* haste therefore,” (addres-
sing himself to the prisoner) “ to associate, at

Be §

- Teast to be ready to associate.—If then such a j
broken state of things should take place, the
‘civil broils that would necessarily ensue,
-would soon subside: before the united, irre-
sistible voice of the whole.—Do not, I entreat
you, hesistate, thinking such a work prema-
ture as yet, but a month, and then it may be
-too late—A malignant party may be already
formed, and only waiting for the halting of
the present managers ; it will then be too late
to seck to subject to deliberation, after a party
has dared the act of rebellion. ‘If you go no
farther than separate Meetings in different
towns, we will not be able to confide in your
. confraternity, because, while in such a state,
you. may be but the tools of a faction—We
could have all confidence, and unite with all
affection in one assembly of commissfencrs
from all countries of the world, if we knew
they were chosen by the unbiassed voice of
. the people, because they would come up with
the same disinterested views and desires as
ourselves, having all agreed to a common
centre of union and interest ; but we could not
confide in fellow-citizens who kept aloof from
-such union, and would not previously affiliate
an one great and indivisible family.”
Upon the 23d of November, 1793, a letter
was written to Norwich, by the prisoner, in
which he informs the society at Norwich,
“ of the convention'called and now sitting in
Edinburgh, for the purpose of obtaining a
speedy and radical reform in the system of
parliamentary representation, and you are
also in possession of the circumstances of our
having sent two delegates, Margarot and
Gerrald, to represent our increasing society in
that respectable assembly. The Society for
Constitutional Information has also elected
‘twu representatives, Yorke and Sinclair, the
datter only of whom has gone to Scotland for
the discharge of his important mission.”
._ Then he states to the Norwich Society, that
the object of the present letter was to inform
them of the important communications which
their mission had produced; that it had dif-
fused spirit and resolution through the dif-
ferent societies in Scotland; that there must
.be a complete union for the recovery of their
rights, and the complete renovation of the
liberties and happiness which they are entitled
to as men, and expect as Britons;—that an
increase of affection, zeal, and confidence—a
concert of peemanent union—a free communi-
cation and comparison of sentiments and
intentions, mature deliberation and mutual
reliance, arethe fruits of the measures adopted
by the friends of liberty in Scotland, and
seconded by those in Lendon and Ireland.
Then he presses the Society at Norwich to
rouse to immediate co-operation with those
efforts in Scotland, for the general good—he
is desirous to awaken them toa sense of the
importance of the object they were to pursue,
nn to persuade all the societies in England
to have an immediate junction with this fede-
ration.—And then he desires them to send a


delegate of their own, in ordef that they may,
by a general union, so step forward an avow
their sentiments, as to ensure a speedy termis
nation of the war, and a: restoration of every
right'to which Britons and freemen are en-
titled.

Your lordships will give me leave to put
you in mind also, that this society wrote to
Sheffield, to Leeds, and'I think to one or two
other places, to send delegates to the conven-
tion in Scotland; they did send delegates to
the convention in Scotland; and: Skirving,
whose name has before occurred, aj pears to
have written circular letters upon the arrival
of the delegates of the two English societies,
desiring all the societies to come %

Your lordships likewise recollect, that we
have given in evidence, letters that were
written by Hardy, and also by peeet and
Gerrald, who were delegates in Scotland ; and
likewise letters written from those delegates
to Hardy, whilst the convention was sitting.

Hardy, in a letter of the 8th of November,
1793, says—“ That part of your letter which
mentioned your visiting different towns in
Scotland, for the purpose of promoting the
cause ;—they were pleased with the idea, bat
they thought that it could not be put in prac
tice, on account of the necessary supplies,
which come in but slowly.”—Your lordshi
will also find that there was that solemn re-
solution made, which has before been men
tioned; and from the proceedings of the s0-
ciety, it is clear. that they had even laid the
plans of future conventions,

Your lordships will also be pleased to recol-
lect that, on the 8th of December, 1793, Mar.
garot, who was then in Scotland, writes to the
secretary of the London Corresponding So-
ciety, a letter—There is also a letter of the
22d of December, 1793, in which M:
writes them, to come to very strong resol
tions.—There is another letter of the 24th of
December, 1793, of Skirving to Hardy, p
which he says—“ The time is now arriv
that we must show ourselves worthy of liberty,
or deservedly lose it;—the opposition of our
adversaries, is demonstration of the propriety
and efficacy of the means which we have em-
ployed to obtain it.”

Then upon the 20th of January, 1794, your
lordship will also recollect, that at the Globe:
tavern they came to precisely the same reso-
lution, as that which was come to in the
convention in Scotland, before that conven
tion was dispersed.—That upon any motion
in the House of Commons, to prevent the

eople meeting in societies for Constitutional
Faeiaetion, 1 e convention should be called
immediately ;—and_ your lordships will also
recollect, that that motien was communicated
from Scotland (after the magistrates had ins
terfered) by a letter which has been read—
written, I think, by Margarot or Skirving,—~
in which they state that that resolution was
come to, leaving out, “ in case of invasion."—~
And they state that letters will not safely
 °


communicate all they have to say upon the
subject.

After the dispersion of the convention,
these societies no longer existed.as a conven-
tion; but the Friends of the People, and other
affiliated societiesin Scotland, proceeded to form
committees of Ways and Means, and Union:
—I have therefore, I submit, clearly laid a
foundation to show.that.up to this period, all
those societies were affiliated, that is the
London and Scotch Societies; and that it is
exceedingly clear, whatever convention was to

called, was to be a convention bath of the
people of England and Scotland.

his being so we have-also laid before your
lordships evidence, of which I will say this
only, that it is evidence to go to the jury, that
the aftiiated societies in London, many of the
members ot them were providing themselves
with muskets and pikes; that the Sheffield
society, which corresponded as well with
Scotland as with London, was also providing
pikes :---then I conceive that I am at liberty to
proveasatactin thiscase, the providing of pikes,
agd the actual existence of nina of resistance
to the government in Scotland at the same
time, precisely upon the same principle as if we
were now trying what would be a much more
manifest overt act, I mean an open rebellion
in the country—I conceive, upon the prin-
ciple laid down in lord Lovat’s, and other
cases, that there could not be a particle of
doubt, that if I had charged an open act of
rebellion in England, that I should have been
entitled to show that in fact there was in
Scotland, another armed force resisting the
king's forces there; even though I did not
show any communication by letter between
them, so as to make it probable that they
were co-operating with each other.

‘I submit to your lordships, that this is evi-
dence to go before the jury, leaving them to
judge of the application that it has.

Mr. Erskine.—-We have been detained here
for so many days, and we who are of counsel
for the prisoner, having only been dismissed
from the court to have that rest which na-
ture requires, without any opportunity of
Jonking at the different papers which consti-
tute the great body of evidence in the cause,
--I confess, for one, that I am not so well
prepared as I ought to be, nor is it possible
for any man to be, to follow the attorney-ge-
neral in the connexion which he seems to
iabour upon the different documents which
he has read. As far as I understand him, I
take it that there is nothing that can or ought
to connect the prisoner with the proceedings
in Scotland; in which he is sought to he in-
volved.—In the first place, the letter which the
altorney-general has sead from Skirving——

Mr. Attorney-General.—In otder that I
may state the thing entirely to the Court, I
‘beg to put the Court in mind that we have
ew proved that a circular letter which was
zo call this convention, has been actually
found in Scotland, and that that isa circular


letter, which is written after resolutions which
state that they are to have a convention of
the people. ‘

Mr. Erskine.—I fares the attorney-
general considers it only as evidence of
first branch. .

Mr. Attorney General.—Yes.

Mr. Erskine.—Then we will admit it.

Mr. Garrow to M‘Ewan.—I believe we
left off at that part of Watt's plan, that had
stated a design of kindling a fire at the Ex-.
cise- office in the new town’—Yes; that a fire
was-to be kindled at the Excise-office, and a

arty of men to be stationed at the Lucken-
ths, a party at the head of the Westbooth,
and the fire was to draw the military from the
rrison. :

From the Castle at Edinburgh ?—Yes.
When they came down past the booth, the
men that were stationed upon the head of the
booth, according as his plan ran, they were to
come in behind them, and the men, stationed
at the Luckenbooths, were to take them in the
front, and so inclose them between two par-
ties; as far as I could understand the paper
read to us, there were different partics, as was
mentioned, who were to seize the different
banking-houses in Edinburgh, and commis-
sioners were to be appointed for to go and .
demand the cash from the banks: that is, as
far as I recollect, the purport of that paper,
which he read at that time. :

whom were those several parties, which
were to be thus stationed, to be composed ?—
I do.not know; I know not a single indi-
vidual. :

What sort of persons, or belonging to what
sort of societies or committees were they to
be?—What I thought upon by his plan wag
that he meant it to be done by the Friends
of the People ; but at the same time I did not
know a single individual that was to engage
in such an affair.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre,—Did he say who
the people were that were to execute this?—
He did not.

Mr. Garrow.—This plan of Watt’s, I under-
stand you, was read at a meeting of the com-
mittee ?—Yes; but I look upon it to be totally
drawn up by himself; I never saw it till that
night when he produced it.

How many members of the grand com-
mittee might be present when Watt read his
first plan?—There were five, J think; a Mr.
Stock, myself, Watt, Downie, and Bonthron.
Of how many was the committee of Ways
and Means composed ?—Of seven altogether.

So that there were five out of those seven
present?—Yes. ‘

When Watt read this paper, what passed
upon it in the committee ?—No farther passed
upon it than that I objected to it, as soon as
I understood he had done reading; I said I
would by no means agree to any thing that
was to disturb the peace, or that tended to
shed the blood of my countrymen; Mr. Bon-
thron agreed along with me; he said, by no
means; and, finding we made opposition to

Upon his proposing the second’ phan, whet

that paper, there was no farther comment | passed about it?—-There was nothing passed

made upon it .
‘Do you remember, at any other time,
Mr. Watt producing either the same plan
with any enlargement, or any new plan or
scheme, for any thing to be put in execution
at Edinburgh?—I remember his reading a
aper:

When?—One of the last times that I was at
that committee; the last, or last but one; I
ami not positive which.

How many persons were present?—I can~
not recollect ; but it was on a night when the
committee used to meet.

The great or sub-committee?—The sub-
committee.

What was the plan proposed by Watt at
that sub-committee meeting ?—It was rather
a copy of a proclamation, as I collected it,

prohibiting all farmers, dealers in corn, meal, |)

ar hay, to remove the same from their respec-
tive places of abode, under pain of death.
- Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Were you pre-
sent at that meeting too?—Yes.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—How soon was
shat after the first?—I could not recollect; I

think I was only five nights at that committee |,

altegether.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Was it the next

night after, or later?—I rather think it might
he two weeks after that.
‘ Mr. Garrow.—-This proclamation forbids
all farmers, dealers in cern, meal, or hay, to
Femove the same under pain of death?
Yes; and also to all gentlemen residing in the
éountry, not to leave their respective habita-
tions for a greater distance than three miles,
under the same penalty ; these, as far as I can
recollect, were the contents of that Vs bag

Was there any thing in that address rela-
tive to his majesty ?---On the other side of
the paper there was a copy of an address to
his majesty.

For what purpose ?—Ordering him to dis-
miss his present ministers, and to put an end
40 this bloody war, or he might expect bad
consequences ; it either ran this way—that
be might expect bad consequences, or he
might abide by the consequences; I could
not understand which.

When was this proclamation, according to
‘Watt’s representation, in that committee, to
be carried into execution?—The paper men-
tioned, I think, that this copy of an address
was to be sent to his majesty the morning
after the attack.

Was the attack that you describe, the draw-
ing the soldiers from the Castle, &c.?—I
could look upon it in no other light than that
this was to strengthen that plan which he
had read in the former committee.

Was it explained by him, in the com-
mittee, what was to be done with those sol-
diers when they should he so surrounded ?—

0.
Nor with the magistrates?—He did‘ not
enter into particulars,

upon it, for when he had read. that paper, I
said, Mp. Watt, these things do pag ad
to the cause of reform, and. I would by no
means agree to any such things.

Had you been a member of the British
Convention at Edinburgh?—Yes.

Were you present at the passing of any of
their solemn resolutions ?>—No; I was not.

Do you know a person of the name of
Orrock ?—Yes.

Do you know of any order he received from
Watt to form any offensive instruments of
any sort?—Yes; Mr. Watt called upon me
one day, and wished me to take a walk to
Robert Orrock’s ; when I went there, he told
him that he wished him to make some pikes,
and, as far as I can recollect, Orrock drew a

‘model, upon the table, or something.

What trade is Orrock ?-—-A smith.

Did he reside in the neighbourhood of
Edinburgh ?--¥es, within a mile. He sketch-
ed it out upona slate, or upon a board ; hesad
he had four thousand to send-to Perth, besides

what he had to distribute about Edinburg);
‘that was all that I remember.

Do you know that, in point of fact, Orrock
did make some pikes for Watt, in consequent
‘of that order?---I only knew it since

was in confinement. . .

Do you know of any having been found in
Watt's or Orrock’s houses ?-—I never saw one
of them.

You mentioned a person of the name of
Stock, who was present at this last meeting st
which you and Watt were present ?—Yes.

Did Mr. Stock, at that time, mention any

lace to which he was going?—I remember

fe did; he said, as far as I can recollect, that
he was either going to London, or to Bristol.

Did. he mention any person in London is
particular upon whom he intended to wait, ia
order to establish'a mode of correspondence
with Mr. Watt?—He said by desire of Mr.
Watt that he would wait upon Mr. Hardy,
Mr. Watt sending. a letter along with him t
Mr. Hardy.

For what purpose: wae he to wait upon Mr.
Hardy ?-—As far as I could understand it, Mr.
Stock said he would take a letter to Mr.
Hardy, and that he would do every thing
his power to-establish a correspondence be-
tween the two. '

What two-do you mean, Hardy and Watt?
—Yes, as far as I' understood him. .

Do you remember Stock writing any thing
then, as a plan of correspondence
himself and any other person ?—I :
he took a sheet of paper, and divided rt; he
marked upon one side, the aristocrats sre do-
ing so and so, om the other; the democrats 90
and so; —. all I can recollect a act

What was that paper represented to
—Watt wished a correspondence betweet
Hardy and him ; he- mentioned that he wish
ed:to corf€spond ina safe metited; and: he




gave him this as a plan how he might corres- ' a plan, and point it out to the attention of the

pond ie safety; that was the plan he men-
tioned.

Was any thing said at that meeting of
Stock’s calling aguin upon Watt on the sub-
ject of his going to London ?—~Watt said if he
would call upon him next day, he should have
the letter.

Did you see any thing more of Stock ?—I
never say any thing more of him after that.

Arthur M‘Ewan cross-examined by Mr.

Erskine,

Whether any letter was ever written to Mr.
Hardy you do not know ?—No.

Or whether Mr. Hardy ever desired his
correspondence you do not know ?—I know
nothing about it.

Were you a member of the Society of the
Friends of the People in Edinburgh ?—I was,
of a society at the Water of Leith.

What was this sub-committee at which
Watt, Downie, and other persons attended ?
—A sub-committee, which I looked upon to
be for the purpose of looking into the finances
of Mr. Skirving, for this reason, that Skirving
had wrote a Teter that there was twenty
pounds owing to him.

What was the object of your society ?—A
parliamentary reform.

What number did your society consist of?
— 1 suppose about twenty.

Were you in the convention ?—Yes.

How many of the meetings did you attend
in the convention when it sat ?—I could not
say; I might be half a dozen nights there.

Were you there when it was dispersed?
when the magistrates came in ?—Yes.

During all the time you attended this con-
vention, did you ever hear, from any of the
members, any such talk as Watt indulged
himself in at the committee ?—Never.

Would you have set your foot into the con-

vention if’ Watt, or any body else, had been
talking of seizing ue the judges, and send-
in g an address to the kin .

Non would not have

would you?—-No.

Was there any thing of that sort in the
convention ?—No.

You never saw any thing of that sort?—

?—No.
dione such a thing,

o.

From all you ever saw or heard of the mem-
bers there, what do you believe the conven-
tion met to do?—As far as I could under-
stand it, they met to obtain a parliamentary
reform.

How did you understand, from the general
conversation and debates in the society, that
they meant to set about obtaining that A—By
2 petition. .

Do_not grrurecdlioet it was said, that al-
apie ge parli t might not be disposed, as
it had not been disposed to listen to petitions
of small bodies of men, when no specific plan
of reform was yet if a vast number

of the people of England were to agree upon

paiement, very probably it would meet with
gd ate ?—I do not oe that.
ere they to have petitioned that ni

or how was that to = done avThat Sey

night when the convention was dispersed, it

was to have come under consideration, either

to petition the House of Commons, or the

King, as far as I can recollect.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Had there been
any notice given of such a motion ?—IHt was
given the night before, as far as I heard.

Mr. Erskine.—You heard so in the conven-
tion ?—¥es,

Lord Chief Justice Eyre —Do not you com
found that with an Address to the Nation ?—
¥ do not recollect that.

Mr. Erskine.—Have you seen the books
lately ?>—No.

Or heard them read ?—No, F never put pen
to paper upon the subject; F never corres-
pounded with any man upon the subject.

Of how many did the convention consist?
—I could not say.

But of how many do you suppose they con-
sisted ?—Near two hundred I dare say.

Had you ever any arms ?—I never saw one.

In any of the debates, that took place
among the members of that. convention, was
it ever proposed that they should arm them
selves to overturn the government ?—I never
heard it.

Was any thing said to that effect in the
convention ?—I never heard it in the conven-
tion.

Was it ever proposed that they should have
arms, im order to defend themselves against the
magistracy, and to insist upon making laws
instead of the parliament ?—I never heard of
arms in one place or another, til Watt asked
me to go that day to Mr. Orrock’s.

Did Watt ever say any thing of that sort in
the convention when you were there *—I' do
not know.

Was he a member of the convention ?—
That I do not know any thing about.

As soon as Watt mentioned this, you say
you rejected it with indignation?—Yes, Mr.
Bonthron and me rejected it.

What sort of people did your socicty con-
sist of 2—Working people.

In your society was it ever proposed or de-
bated among you to overturn the govctn-
ment?—No.

What sort of a reform was it you wanted ?
~—-The reform most of them spoke of was uni-
versal suffrage and annual parliaments ; some
were of that way of thinking, some for trien-
nial iorige pate as settled at the Revolution.

Ww did you understand by universal
suffrage ?—-The people at large to have thc
choice of their representatives.

Was it ever debated, or was it ever pro-
posed: that the king’s persan or his throne

were to be touched?—I never heard that
mentioned. 8

Were you to petition for any alteration in

the House of Lords, or any thing of that sort?
—No, to petition the House of Commons, or
the King.

Arthur M‘Ewan re-examined by Mr. Garrow.

What was the Committee of Union for?---
I can give no information as to that. _

Upon your oath, was not the Committee of
Union after the dispersion of the British Con-
vention, for the purpose of establishing a new
convention, a convention of emergency ?—
Upon my oath I never heard at all,—I never
was in it but that night when the letter was
read from Skirving. I was never in it but
that night I mention.

Oh! then a sub-committee formed out of
the Committee of Union ?—The first night I
was in that committee, which is styled a
Committee of Union, that letter was read
from Skirving:—the next night again I was
appointed a member of this sub-committee,
and what was going on in that Committee of
Union I know not.

Do you mean to represent that the purpose
of the committee of Union, as well as that of
Ways and Means, was only relative to Skir-
ving’s letter about his own finances.—I ask
you was it not for the purpose of establishing
a fund far a new convention ?—All the trans-
actions I ever saw was in that light.

You can give no account what the Com-
mittee of Union was for?—No, I was never
in but that night that I was appointed a
member of the sub-committee,

You would not have gone into the conven-
tion, if you had had an idea of employing an
force, or touching the king’s majesty, or at all
encroaching upon the constitution, or produc-
ing in short a reform, but by peaceable
means?—No.

Did you know that your convention had
resolved :—‘‘ That this convention, consi-
dering the calamitous consequences of any
act of the Icgislature, which may tend to
deprive the whole, or any part of the peo-

le of their undoubted right to meet, either

yy themselves, or by delegation, to discuss
any matter relative to their common snr
whether of a public or private nature; ani
holding the same tobe totally inconsistent
with the first principles and safety of society ;
and also subversive of our known and ac-
knowledged constitutional liberties ; — do
hereby declare, before God and the world,
that we shall follow the wholesome example
of former times, by paying no regard to any
act which shall militate against the constitu-
tion of our country; and shall continue to
assemble and consider of the best means by
which we can accomplish a real representa-
tion of the people, and annual election ; until
compelled to desist by seperr force” ?--I do
not remember any such thing.

Do not you know that with reat solemnity
the convention had come to that resolution?
—-No, I do not know that.

Did you not know that the convention had


resolved, that in certain emergencies, they
should declare their sittings permanent ?—
No, I did not know that neither.

Nor that it should be constituted, and pro-
ceed to business, as svon as twenty-one should
be met ?—No.

Did you not know that the convention re-
solved that the delegates were to hold them-
selves ready to depart at an hour's warning,
and to repair to the place of mecting ap-
pointed by the committee of emergency.—
Did you?—I have heard of that, but only
know of that by hearsay.

You have heard the delegates were to meet
at an hour's notice ?—I heard it mentioned
that they were to have another convention,
and that the sociclty were to get information
respecting that other meeting.

That iivey were to be furnished with in-
formation ?—That they were to get informa-
tion.

Who was to furnish them with it?—I do
not know. mM :

Upon your oath, do not you know it was to
be a convention of emergency ?—No.

The purpose of this new convention. I take
it for granted, was only to petition parliament

for a reform ?—That was the purpose of the
society I belonged to.
And that was to be, the purpose of the new
convention ?—I could not say as to that at all.
This pestleinen has got you to say, thag

you would not have remained for a moment
in the convention, if you had had the idea of
any force being employed ;—upon your oath,
how came you to attend a second meeting of
the sub-committee, with Watt, who had pro-
posed a plan for drawing down the soldiers
from the castle, in order to have them sur-
rounded by the Friends of the People, and for
carrying that first plan into execution >—How
came you to meet him at a second meeting,
when he was enlarging upon that plan ?—I
did not know that he would repeat it again.
Did-you go and inform aay magistrate of
such a plot ?—No, but I informed the sheriff,
Did you inform the sheriff of the first plan,
before Watt communicated the second ?—

No. :

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—You are asking
this man to go the length of convicting him-
self of high treason.—The Court oughtto take
care in the examination of a witness, that he
is not called upon to accuse himself—He is
upon very perilous pround. 1 am not quite
sure that you would be permitted to make use
‘of a man’s evidence against himself so ob-

tained, or I would not have permitted it to
have gone omso long.

Mr. Garrow.—It has been examined to on
the other side.——

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—It is difficult to
say that.a question should be asked on one
side, which should not be controverted by ex-
amination on the other side ;—witnesses

therefore should understand to what they sube
ject themselves. . .

M Eo:an.—My Lord, I am not ci calibed
with these things, and I hope your lordship
will protect me.

Willian Middleton sworn—by holding up the
hand, Examined by Mr. Garrow.

Did you search the house of Watt, who was
executed at Edinburgh P—Yes, I searched his
house upon the 15th of May last.

Did you find any pikes in his house ?—

Yes.

Mr. Erskine.—This was after Mr. Hardy
was taken up.

Mr. Attorney General—It has now been
spoken of, that Watt gave orders for pikes—
we shall be able to prove by the time at which
the orders were given, that it was before
Hardy was apprehended.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—That cannot be
admitted.

{The Court was about to adjourn.]

Mr. Erskine.—My lords this is the fourth
day that my friend Mr. Gibbs and myself,
have stood undoubtedly in a very anxious si-
tuation ;—there has been a most voluminous
body of written evidence, all of which has not
been printed ;—copies of that part which is
unprinted, have not as yet reached me :—
there have been two days spent in hearing
parole evidence ; and we being but two as-
signed as counsel for the prisoner, have been
obliged constantly to be engaged in court, in
Cross-examining the witnesses for the crown ;
and your lordships very well know, that the
¢ross-examination of the witnesses, presents
@ great feature of our case on the part of the
prisoner.—A great deal of that has fallen
upon me :—your lordships must be sensible
it is impossible I could at the time of cross-
examining a witness, take any particular note
of what he has said—When the evidence for
the crown was near closing, as I thought, I
humbly requested of your Torlships for the
indulgence of an hour or two to look over the
papers ;—your lordships were pleased to grant
my request, which I considered as a personal
civility to myself—I was prevented by ex-
treme sickness, from availing myself of those
two hours, for I was extremely ill, and nothing
less than a case of this magnitude could have
brought me into this court.—Since that time
I bave nothad natural rest, for I have not got
home till between two and three o'clock in
the morning, and have been here again at
nine; so that I can say, with a safe conscience,
I have not had an opportunity of casting m
eye upon any part of the evidence, though
trust I have something of the general result
of itin my mind.—TI should hope, under these
circumstances, the prisoner may be indulged
with some opportunity, for my friend Mr.
Gibbs and myself, to arrange our papers, and
consider them together as counsel for the pri-
soner, before we are called upon to make our
defence :—and it is necessary to do this, not
for my address to the jury only, but it is ne-


cessary when J address the jury, that I pre-
sent them the prisoner's case, that depends
much upon the arrangement of the evidence ;
—and I feel nyself in no condition todo this,
either ina manner that is respectful, or fit for
the Court, or for the safety of the prisoner.—f
do not wish to impose any particular time, but
merely to leave it to the indulgence and jus+
tice of the Court, perfectly sure when I leave
it there, I leave it in a safe place.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I feel the weight
of your observations, of the difficulty under
which you labour, in an extraordinary case,
which can hardly be judged of by the common
rules on which we proceed in cases of this
nature;—the Court are of a disposition to give
you all the indulgence they Repsihly can, be-
cause there is a vast mass of evidence; the
case arises out of the evidence, and it is fit the
case should be thoroughly canvassed.—At the
same time, it is certainly notorious that the
great bulk of that evidence has been in print
a great while, and I cannot believe that it has
not been very well considered as far as it has
been in print-—I am sure that must be un=
derstood.

Now I will tell you very fairly, if the ques-
tion were only the personal accommodation
of yourself and Mr. Gibbs, at the expense of
the personal convenience of myself, my lord,
and my brothers, I am quite sure we should
have no difficulty in the sacrifice of our per-
sonal convenience ;—but there is a great deal
more in the case,—we have a jury who have
been thrown into the most arduous service
that ever I sawa jury engagedin: they have
borne it in a manner that does them infinite
honour, and I have no doubt but that as far as
it is necessary that they should continue in
the situation they are in, that they will bear
it chearfully.—I have seen such a specimen
of their behaviour, that I cannot entertain 2
doubt of that ;—but that we could give you
an absolute suspension of the business in the
situation that we are in, upon the terms of
keeping the jury in the situation in which
they must be kept, is athing that it is per-
fectly impossible for us to think of. Now
this occurs to me;-—-my brothers will con-
sider of it;—I merely throw it out for their
consideration.—You are men of honour, you
will tell us whether you really do mean to call
witnesses, or to take the case upon the ground
upon which it is already made :—If you mean
tocall witnesses, you may call them to-morrow ;

ou may go on with the case as far as it will

e necessary for you to go on, to fillup all the
time that ought to be filled up, leaving only a
part of Sunday, the common interval of rest,
without our keeping the jury in a situation to
do nothing.—If you do not mean to call wit-
nesses, but mean to leave the case with the
observations which arise upon the evidence
that is before the Court, we will go as far as
we can ;—but if witnesses are to be called,
and you desire not to address the jury imme-
diately, you must immediately begin to ex-

amine your witnesses, as soon as they have
closed en the part of the crown; and fill up
the time that will intervene between that time
and the time when you will be ready to go on
with your address to the jury.—In that way I
think we shall put the jury under no unneces-
sary hardships, because whether they hear
the witnesses before or after the specch, is a
matter of no importance to them.

Mr. Erskine.—I should be afraid to take
upon myself the experiment of trying a cause,
particularly of this magnitude, in a manner to-
tally different from any that ever occurred in
the annals of this country. I should be afraid
to begin an experiment of that sort, more
especially when counsel in a capital case; be-
cause undoubtedly the evidence comes with
infinitely more weight, and I mean by weight
the proper weight evidence ought to have,
the ing of it upon the case when stated by
the counsel, who is to introduce it; and much
of the effect of evidence is lost, and much dis-
torted by the cross-examination of counsel,
until the true bearing of it is explained. I do
not propose that which can be properly termed
a suspension of the trial, that could throw that
sort of inconvenience upon the jury, which
would, I am sure, give me as much pain as
any body in the world ;—but your lordships
will recollect the attorney general in opening
his case (I am sure I think as highly as it is
possible of the ability of the attorney-general,
and of the manzer in which he pertormed his
duty), he found it necessary undoubtedly to
spend nine hours in the opening of that case,
—the prisoner most unquestionably may ex-
oe an equal time, if it were necessary, for

is counsel te take the same course in opening
his case ;—and if I were thrown upon it in the
present moment, not having a sufficient re-
collection af the great points of the evidence;
df I were put upon speaking to the jury, I
might take that course of ing at great
Jength, great umbers of 3;— whereas, if
i had the opportunity of a few hours mene,
which is the nature of my application, merely
to arrange my papers, and to select such as,
in the judgment of my learned friend and my-
self, are sufficient to do this as it ought to be
done, it would save time.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I dread the ex-
planation ofa few hours; Mr. Attorney Ge-
sere what farther evidence have you to pro-

Mr. Attorney General.—I think my evi-
dence will not take up more than forty
minutes,

Mr. Erskine.—I do not know whether your
lordships mean to sit on Sunday.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—tI shall sit late
on Saturday night ; I say ing of Sunday.

Mr. Erskine.—L am literally at this moment,
and I have been all day yesterday and to-da:
so extremely unwell, that I do not think if
were called upon to speak for aay length of
time, I could possibly support it.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—i can casily think


that to be the case, and it is a circumstance [
am extremely sorry for; on the other hand,
I cannot hazard the situation of the jury.

Mr. Erskine.—I should be sorry to put the
jury to any inconvenience.—I do not shrink
from the business ; I am extremely willing to
suffer any thing, but I assure _yoyr lordship
that my health is extremely suffering by it.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—What is it you
ask for?

Mr, Erskine.—As I stated before, the at-
torney-general found it necessary to consume
nine hours, I shall not consume half that
time,—certainly I think I shall not consume
half that time, if I bad an opportunity of doing
that which I humbly request of the court, that
is, of arranging the materials in such a manner
that I should be able to make those observa-
tions which occur to me to be the proper ob-
servations to be made, as counsel for the pri-
soner. -

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Wehave offcred
you an expedient; neither of you say to us
whether you can accept it,

Mr. Gibbs.—With respect to that expedient
T have no douht to say, that it is utterly im-
possible for Mr. Erskine and myself, in the
situation in which we are, respecting uurselves,
respecting the Court, and respecting the public,
pe the jury, it is utterly impossible for us to
think of that, because if any thing adverse
should happen when we have taken such a
line, the imputation will lie upon us.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—That it may not
be in your judgment a desirable thing is very
well, but that there is any other objection to
it, I cannot agree to. Whether the case is
taken upon the summing up of the evidence,
or whether it is taken upon the opening of
the evidence, is as to all legal purpose the
same; I can see no difference: it may make
a vast difference in your judgmeut, as to whet
is the best manner and the best method of
laying your case before the jury ; undoubtedly
we are assisting the prisoner by putting the
counsel in a situation to do his business in the
best manner, by proposing it thus; whereas
if they were put u Going it in the ordi
course, they would lie under a peculiar di
culty and disadvantage. Mr. Erskine has act
yet told us what he asks.

Mr. Erskine.—Since it is put expressly to
me, I shall propose, unless the jury profess #
a very serious inconvenience to them, instead
of coming in the morning at the time we
generally come, our coming at twelve o'clock,
80 that the attorney-g: can finish at one.
Mr. Gibbs will have the goodness to take a
note of the few facts stated Ly the witnesses 5
I shall be able by that time to come.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Then suppose
we adjoura to eleven o'clock. ;

Mr. Gibbs.--We conceive your lordships
will permit Mr. Erskine to open the case of
Mr. any: then our witnesses will be exa-
mined, and then I shall be heard after ous
witnesses,

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—You will con-
duet your case in the manner you think best
for the interest of your client.

Mr. Erskine.—I should be glad if your lord-
ships would allow another hour.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---I feel so much
for the situation of the jury, that on their
account I cannot think of it.

Mr. Erskine.—My lord, I never was placed
in such a situation in the whole course of my
practice before, with so many gentlemen on
the other side; however, I do not shrink
from iy

One of the Jury.-My lord, we are ex-
tremely willing to allow Mr. Erskine another
hour, if ee lordship thinks proper. .

Lord Chief Justice Fyre.—As the jury ask
it for you, I will not refuse you.

[It now being half past one o'clock, on
Saturday morning, the Court adjourned
to twelve o’clock.]

Lord Chief Justice Eyre; Lord Chief Baron
Macdonald; Mr. n Hotham; Mr. Jus-
tice Buller; Mr. Justice Grose; and others
his Majesty’s Justices, &c.

Thomas Hardy set to the bar.

Me. Attorney General.—-I am now going to
call a witness to prove that a paper was found
in the possession of Mr. Thelwall, and also to
prove that another paper of the same sort was
found in the possession of Mr. Martin, being
of the hand-writing of Martin. These papers
were found after the apprehension of Mr.
Hardy. When I have proved that the papers
were found in the possession of Martin and of
Thelwall, I shall then go on to prove by a
witness or two, whom t shall call for that
purpose, that they existed in the possession of
each of them long before the apprehension of
Mr. Hardy: they purport upon the face of
them to be iagered for the general meetin;
of the Corresponding Society, upon the 14¢!
of April, 1794, at Chalk Farm.

Mr. Gibbs.---Your lordship secs that the
evidence offered is that these papers, after the
apprehension of Mr. Hardy, were found in the
possession of Mr. Martin and Mr. Thelwall,
merely that they. were in their possession,
not that they were ever used by them---it
does not appear but that they might have got
into their possession again, but simply that
they were in their custody as a newspaper is
in my hand this morning, and may pass inte
other hands.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—The only ground
upon which any paper is objected to as evi-
dence, found after the apprehension of the
party, is Sot by possibility the paper might
Dot have existed, or might not have been in
the hands of the person till after his appre-



hension ; that is the only gecanil upon which
the evidence is refused; if they remove that
ground of objection, it is admissible.

Mr. Gibbs.—I understand the rule gene-
rally to go to any paper that was in the hands
of any one daa I understand that to be
the principle.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---That goes rather
to the effect of the evidence, than to the ad-
missibility; it being found in the possession
of the parties before the apprehension, re-
moves in fact the objection.

Mr. Attorney General.---Mr. Martin and
Mr. Thelwall, in whose custody the papers
were found, were persons who, together with
Mr. Hardy, were appointed to prepare the
proceedings for the Chalk Farm meeting.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---I observed that
that goes more to the effect of the evidence,
than, to its admissibility. ‘

Mr. Charles Schaw sworn.---Examined by Mr.
Attorney General.

Where did you find that paper ?~-[showing
it tb the witness]---In Mr. Thelwall’s house.
When you apprehended him?---After he
was taken away; I remained to bring away
the papers.
Upon what day?---On the night of the
13th of May, or the morning of the 14th. It
was the morning of the 14th.
Mr. Gibés.—This is certainly an informal
mode of proceeding; I conceive that these
japers cannot possibly attach upon Mr.
Fiardy, as they were found subsequent to his

being taken into custody.
John Nost sworn.—Examined by Mr. Attorney~
General. “

Look at that paper.---[showing it to the
witness. }---I found this in Mr. Martin's chest
in the King’s-beneh prison. .

Mr. Gibbs—When did you find it?—On
the 29th of May.

Mr. Willian Walker called again.

Mr. Attorney General.-—Look at that paper
[showing it to the witness] do you know
whose hand-writing that is ?---I believe it ta
be Mr. Martin’s hand. writing.

Have you seen him write ?~-I have.

[Another paper. shown to the witness.]

Whose hand-writing do you believe that
to be?---I' believe that also to be Mr. Mar-
tin’s hand-writing. ~ .

Mr. Gibbs.—Did you ever see Mr. Martin
write?—Yes, frequently. .

You did live in the Adelphi, I believe ?—I
did.

Evan Evans sworn.—-Examined by. Mr.
Attorney General.
You were confined in the King’s-benth
prison, I believe, fur debt ?-—Yes.
When did you leave the King’s-hench ?---t
cannot rightly tell,
3K

How long ago?---I suppose six or seven
months ago. I Icft it on the 31st of July.

How long had you been there ?-—Near two
years,

i you know John Martin ?--- Perfectly
well.

Was hea prisoner there ?---He was.

- Do you remember, while you were in the
King’s Bench, ever secing either of the papers
now put into your hand ?---I remember per-
fectly well seeing both the papers.

When was it that you saw them ?---I be-
lieve about the beginning of April.

Look at the top of this paper, and tell me
whether it was before the date there men-
tioned, or not?—It was before this time.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre--Where did you
see them ?---In the room where Martin was.

Mr. Attorney General.~-Had you any con-
versation with Martin at that time ?---I had
---be told me he wrote the resolutions for the
society at Chalk Farm; he had a copy of
them, and read them several times in the
room. :

Look at the other paper, and tell my lord
and the jury whether those are the papers
which he read several times in the room, or
not?---I really cannot recollect; he often read
them to one Pearce, who used to come to see
him; he said he wrote the resolutions for
Chalk Farm, and that there was plenty of
cayenne in them; and if they followed his
advice or example, there would be warm work
among them before the month of May was
out.

Did you know Pearce ?-—Perfectly well.

Did he use to come there?—He took the
resolutions from Martin to Chalk Farm.

Mr. Gibbs.---How do you know that?—I
saw Martin give the papers to Pearce.

Mr. Attorney General.~-Was Mrs. Evans,

es.

Evan Evans cross-examined by Mr. Gibbs.

- What are you?—TI was fortherly a grocer.

.. Were you in the King’s-bench prison for
debt ?---Yes,

, For two years I think you say ?—-Nearly.

Had you any difference with Mr. Martin
there?--We had a difference last of all;
Mr. Martin wished to have the room I was in
to himself.

I do not want to know the reason of your
difference~-you had a. violent quarrel ?.--
No; we had no quarrel, only a dispute.

You never uttered any expressions of re-

sentment or threats against him, did you?— {_

Never.

Evan Evans re-examined by Mr. Altorney-
General.

Was there a man of the name of Gay in
the King’s bench prison at the time that
Martin was there ?-—There was.

Mr. Attorney General.---At the end of Mar-
tin’s letter he mentions Gay.

Ann Evans sworn..—Examined by Mr. At-
torney General.

You are the wife of the gentleman who
gave evidence just now ?--—Yes.

You attended your husband, I believe, in
the King’s-bench prison?--- Yes; I went
backwards and forwards to him.
ve you know Mr. Martin?~-Yes; very
well.

Did you ever see these papers before, look
at them ? [showing them to the witness. }—
Yes; I have seen them both.

Where may you have seen them ?--In the
King’s-bench. - an

In whose room or possession P--In Mr.
Evans’s room, in Mr. Martin’s possession.

When was it that you saw them there ;
was it before or after the month stated at the
top?-—It was in that month,

Did you happen to hear Mr. Martin say
any thing respecting these papers; and if he
said any thing, what was it that he did say ?
—~I remember his reading this papers particu-
larly mentioning that it is not lawful to take
up arms against the king; he read the
through, but there is nothing more I
recollect, as I was passing to and fro, but those
words,

Did you hear him say any thing else,
except what he said about the paper '—-No-
thing else; there were three gentlemen pre-
sent, to whom he read it.

Was there any talk about Chalk-farrn?—
Yes; I heard him mention that he had drawn
the resolutions up for Chalk-farm.

Did he say any thing else?--He said if
they kept by his resolutions, they were
very warm ones, for he had put plenty of
Cayenne into them, and that there wi be
very warm work.

Do you remember a person of the name of
Pearce coming there ?-—Perfectly well; Mr,
Martin’s clerk.

Had Martin and Pearce any conversation
about these papers, or Chalk-farm ?—I heard
none till he brought the resolutions printed :
Pearce said he had had many of them, but
that he had distributed them among the
workmen of a Coach-maker in Long- Acre,
but that Mr. Hardy had a great many more
printed, and that he could get more.

Mr. Gibbs.—-Your lordskips see this is not
evidence against Mr. Herdy; in fact, it is
not the more evidence for Hardy's name
being mentioned, than if it was not men-
tioned. 5

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I do not know
that it is,

Ann Evans cross-examined by Mr. Gibbs.

What resolutions were those that Mr. Mar-
tin spoke of?—For the meeting of the London
Corresponding Society at a dancing room in
Tottenham Court Road, and that they removed
from thence to Chalk-farm.

Mr. Aitorney-General.—Do you know what
street that is in?—No.

Mr. Gibbs.---Can you swear that these are
the very papers that you saw in Mr. Martin's
hand ?—I can.

Were they ever put into your hand to read?
——They were not; but Ihave had them in my
hand frequently.

Since ?—No, at that time.

You have frequently read them ?---Yes.

You amused yourself with looking into
Mr. Martin's papers when he was not there?
»--And when he was present likewise.

When you speak of the copies that Pearce
said had been give among the Coach-makers,
do you mean to say that they were copies of
these papers?—'They were the resolutions
printed.

But you do not mean that they were copies
of those which are now put into court?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—I did not under-
stand them to be the originals, or copies of
the resolutions read at Chalk-farm, but that
Martin said, at the time they saw these
papers, that he had prepared the resolutions

x Chalk-farm, and that the paper brought
by Pearce was a printed copy of those resolu-
tions; unless this shall turn out to be the
original of the resolutions, it amounts to no-
thing.

Mr. Gibbs.—I know it is not, but I thought
that mistake might arise.

Thomas Tourll sworn,---Examined by Mr.
Attorney General.

. I believe you had the misfortune to be in

the King’s-bench poss about the months of

March and April Jast >—Yes.

- Da you know Mr. John Martin at all ?---I

know him by frequently seeing him in Mr.
_ Evans’s room; I never knew him before he

came there.

That is the husband of the lady who was
here just now ?—Yes.

Did you ever see this paper before?
[showing it to the witness. ]|—No.

. Did you hear Martin say any thing about
the Chalk-farm meeting?-—I did.

Be so good as state what you heard him
say ?---One orang, when I called in at Mr.
Evans’s room, Mr. Martin came in.

What month was that in?-—I believe in
April; it was three or four days before the
Chalk- farm business.

State what Mr. Martin said in your hearing,
about the Chalk-farm business ?---Mr Martin
came in, and tbe business of Chalk-farm came
up; he asked meif I had read any thing of
it—I told him I had not; in conyersation, he
said he had.drawn up, and I think he said he


had sent the resolutions; I am certain he
said he drew them up, and, he said, if they
followed the resolutions, there would be warm.
work, for he had put in plenty of Cayenne.

Was there aman of the name of Gay in
prison at that time ?—There was.

Were he and Martin much together ?—Very
often.

Mr. Attorney General_—t will read _pre-
sently a-rcsolution of the Constitutional So-
ciety, relative to that Mr. Gay; his name
occurs in that letter, and I think he appears
to be proposed as a member to that societ;
by Mr. Tooke. :

Did you see Pearce there ?—I have seen:
him there two or three times. 7

Perhaps you had not occasion to observe
any particular communication between them?
~I had not. 7

Mr. Attorney General.—Now LI take it there
is no objection to reading the paper; there-
fore I desire it may be read, and I would beg
of your lordships and the jury, not only to at-
tend to what is left in the paper, but to what
is struck out of it to look at the paper itself. -

[The paper read.]

“ At a general Meeting of the London Cor-
responding Society, held at — on
Monday, the 14th day of April, 1794.

“ Citizen in the chair.

“ Resolved, That all meee ens legislative,
and judicial powers, are the rights of the peo-
ple; and though the people have delegated
those their original powers to others, in trust,
for the benefit of the community, yet the
rights themselves are reserved by the people,
and cannot be absolutely parted with by the
people to those persons who are employed to
conduct the business of the state. J

“ Resolved, That the constitution of Eng-
land is held by the King, Lords, and Com-
mons, and other officers appointed by the
people in trust, for the benefit of the people ;
and though these trustees may regulate and
improve the constitution, yet they cannot
alter or subvert it without committing treasom
against the nation.

Resolved, That Magna Charta, or THE
GREAT CHARTER OF THE LIBERTIES
OF ENGLAND, made in the reign of king
John; THE PETITION OF RIGHTS, as-
sented to by parliament in the reign of kin:
Charles 1st and the several laws made at ani
in consequence of the Glorious Revolution in
the year 1688, are declaratory of those parts
of the constitution of England, which are iar
and by them respectively declared.

“ Resolved, That the office of KING of
England was not instituted by the people
merely as an office of profit and honour to
the king, but he was so appointed as chief
trustee and guardian of the constitution and
rights of the people, and that important and
laborious penal duties are annexed to the
regal office, the objects of which are to pro-

mote the good of the people, and preserve
their rights in full vigour from innovation and
corruption.

Resolved, That it is the duty of the king to
preserve the constitution of England and the
rights of the people against every encroach-
ment; and in order to enforce that duty, the
following oath is required to be taken by
every king on his accession to the throne of
Great Britain, to wit: the arch-bishop or
bishop shall say—* Will you solemnly _pro-
“ mise and swear to govern the people of this
“kingdom of England, and the dominions
* thereto belonging, according to the statutes
“in parliament agreed on, and the laws and
* customs of the same?’

“The king or queen shall say, ‘ I solemnly
“promise so to do.’ Archbishop or bishop—
£ Will you to your power cause law and jus-
‘tice in mercy to be executed in all your
‘judgments?’ ANS. ‘I will’

“ After this, the king or queen, laying his
or her hand on the holy Gospels, shall say—
‘The things which I have before promised I
“will perform and keep; so help me God’
and then shall kiss the book.

“ Resolved, That his present majesty, kin,
George 8rd, on his accession to the throne o
these realms, did solemnly take the said oath.

“ Resolved, That the constitutional rights
of the people have been violated, and that it
is the duty of the people, in the present
atarming crisis, to assemble and inquire into
the innovations or infringements which have
been made upon the rights of the people, and
how far the declarations of the constitution,
as they were settled at the aforesaid Revolu-
tion, remain in force, and which of them have
been violated, and by whom; and also whe-
ther such innovations, infringements, and
violations, have been committed from the
negligence or corruption of those who have
been intrusted with the government of the
state.

“ Resolved, That this society do invite the
ee to meet in their respective nighbour-

joods, to elect one or more person or persons
as delegates to meet in a convention, to be
held on the day of. next,
at such place as shall be appointed by the
secret committee of this society; and that
the poe so elected do forthwith trans-
mit to the secretary of this society, No. 9,
Piccadilly, London, the vouchers of their se-
veral elections, in order that the place of
meeting may be duly notified to them.

“ Resolved, That it is the right and the
bounden duty of the people to punishall traitors
against the nation, and that the followin,
words are now not a part of the oath of allegi-
ance; to wit, ‘I declare that it is not lawful,
‘upon any pretence whatever, to take arms
* against the king.’”

John Edwards called again.—Examined by

Mr. Garrow.

You have been already examihed P—Yes.


Were you a member of the London Corres-
ponding Society ?—Yes.

And attended the division meetings ?—Yes.

Look at that paper [showing hima pepe);
were papers of that sort distributed at the
vision meeting of the society ?—I never saw
them distributed.

Did you ever see them there; I saw one
of them handed round at the division st
Snow-hill.

When ?—I cannot justly say.

About how long ago ?—May be nine months
ago now.

Did you see more than one ?—I never saw
but that one.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—What mamber
was that division? —The division that met
at Scotney’s, the Three Tuns, on Snow-hill, I
think No. 11.

Mr. Gibbs.—Does your lordship think that
without producing the paper itself, which
was handed round, they can give in evidence
@ paper similar to it?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—If he can take
upon himself to say that it is the same
paper.

[It was read.]

« Countrymen, you are told by those who
are in office, that you arein danger of a Freoeb
invasion.

“You are told by those who are cat of

| office, that you are in danger of a Hessiaa ur
Hanoverian invasion.

“In either case arms will be of use to yous
agree among yourselves, get arms, and
the use of them !”

William Middleton called again.—Examined
by Mr. Garrow.

Did you at any time find any pikes in the
house of Orrock in Edinburgh?—Yes; upon
the evening of the 15th of May last I
searched the house of Orrock.

Did you find any pikes there? —Yes—to
the amount of thirty-three, finished aud un-
finished.

‘Those which you state to be finished, had
blades and shafts] suppose?—‘They were nove
of bein with shafts, there were only the
blades.

Did you find any in the possession of any
other person?-—Upon the same day, in the
house of Robert Watt, who was lately executed
at Edinburgh, there were twelve found at ond
search, and four at another.

Were they likewise blades without shafts?

—There was one shaft.

Mr. Gibbs.—Does your lotdship think that
this, which was all after the apprehension of
the prisoner, is evidence?

Mr. Attorney General.—I mentioned hast
night that I had proved the order to be given
for them before the apprehension of the pri-
foner; the order by Watt and M‘Bwan.

Mr. Gidts.—Then that is all that you cam
prove; ; ;

. Mr. Attorney General—We have proved
that Stock produced to Watt and Ross a
printed circular ietter, signed Thomas Hardy,
which is verbatim the same circular letter, a
bandle of which was found in the possession
of the prisoner; we have already proved that
there was a conversation at that time, in
which Watt desired that Stock would bring
about a communication with Hardy ; we cer-
tainly have not proved that Stock brought
about that communication ; but, I submit to
your lordships, that if we prove the order for
the pikes to have been given previous to that
time, that the execution of that order follows
naturally, and necessarily upon it.

Mr. Garrow.—We submit to your lordships
that it is evidence to go to the jury, that the
pikes which were found in the possession of
Watt, are those pikes which were made in
execution of the order given by Watt to Or-
rock, antecedent to the apprehension of the
prisoner.

Mr. Gibbs.— It seems to me that upon
the principle your lordships have laid down,
that nothing which happened after the ap-
prehension of the prisoner can be evidence
against him; this evidence ought to be ex-
cluded: whether the evidence they have

iven, previous to the apprehension, answers

e purpose they wish, ts another thing; but
some pikes having been ordered by Orrock,
or Watt, before the apprehension of Mr.
Hardy, does not make the finding of these
pikes, after the apprehension df Hardy, evi-
dence, any more than if no order whatever
had been given for them previously: if the
former evidence is not complete for the pur-
pose for which they want it, [cannot conceive
upon what principle the pikes being found
in the possession of this man, after Mr.
Hardy’s apprehension, is rendered evidence,
by a circumstance which happened before it ;
itwould not have been evidence supposing
that communication had not taken place.

Lord Chiet Justice Eyre.—It appears to
me that there is @ clear, satisfactory ground
upon which the evidence must be received,
at the same time that you would be at liberty
to insist that the execution of the order after-
wards does not personally affect the prisoner,
but it is a circumstance in evidence to esta-
blish the truth of the evidence of the order
that the things were found afterwards corres-
pin with the ore .

t. Gibbs.—Your lordship sees, in arguin,
this, that do not mean to admit that the
order was Mr. Hardy’s, or any thing like it.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Nor do I wish
to Ee you to admit any such thing.

1. Garrow to ‘Middleton, — Flow many

did you find?—In the first search I found.

twelve blades without handles.

What was it that led you to search Watt’s
house ?—The circumstance that carried me
there was, there was a bankrupt had secreted
Some goods in Watt's house; in searching
es those effects I found these blades for

8, :


In what part of the house did you find
them ?—In the lower part of the house, in
his dining room, as his maid called it; a
locked-fast closet, or a locked-fast press.

Did you deliver to Mr. Clerke, the sheriff
of Edinburgh, those which you found in the
house of Orrock, and those which you found
in the house of Watt?—They were brought
to Sheriff Clerke’s office, and lodged there;
there was one shaft found aleng with the
four which were found at the second search.

Were the shaft and the blade united, at the
time you found them, or apart?—They were
not united; but there was a Mr. William
Lockhart, sheriff Clerke’s depute, attended ;
we tried one of the blades to the shaft, an
they fitted exactly.

‘the manner in which they are attached is,
I understand, by a screw ?—Yes,

Mr. Lockhart, you said, was with you P—~
He was present with me in the man’s house.

John Edwards.—I shall esteem it a favou¥
if I may be permitted to say a few words to
the jury, before I leave the court. .

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—To the Jury !—~
Or to your lordship.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Is it to changé
any thing in the testimony you have given?
—Not to change, to explain. When I was
examined the ni hit before last, Mr. Garrow
was very particular in asking me if I received
an address to a person at Sheffield from Mr.
Hardy; it is true I received an address, and a
meeting was to have taken place in Green-
Arbour-court; I wish to let the jury know
that that meeting never did take placé; no
money was put down, and no letter was sent
to Sheffield.

Mr. Attorney General.—Having mentioned
this, I would ask, had you any talk with Hil-
lier about the ale-house in Green-Arbour-
court?—On the day that Hardy was taken
into custody, Hillier and Gosling wete at our
house,

When did you first see Hillier’s pike?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—This leads to 4
cross-examination. A witness desires to ex-

lain a circumstance in his evidence; I should
ery unwilling to introduce a new exami-
nation.

Mr. Garrow.—Does not your lordship think
it fit to inquire whom he has talked to since
he was examined?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—No; I do not
think it necessary; his explanation seems a
fair one, to prevent any misinterpretation of
his evidence. .

Mr. Attorney General:'—If a witness is to
come afterwards, in this way, to explain his
evidence, his not stating this in his original
examination cuts out a great number of mate~
rial questions.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I perfectly
with you; this explanation ought to be re~
lave with abundant caution by the jury;
and from another circumstance, the sort o
practice we have got-into, of any man’s print-
u

ing such accounts as his industry may collect
in court, is certainly a very inconvenient prac-
tice, because it may lead to conversations with
witnesses, and may induce these explanations.
The jury will understand that the explanation
is made in that situation of things, and they-
will form their own judgment upon it. Yet
still, [ think, it should rest with the esplana-
tion that the witness desires to offer.

Mr. William Lockhart, sworn.—Examined by
Mr. Garrow.

You are what they call sheriff Clerke’s
depute, in the city of Edinburgh ?—Yes.

Did you go with Middleton to the house of
Orrock ?—No; to Watt’s house.

Were you present at the finding of any
blades for pikes at Watt’s honse ?—Yes,

How many did you find upon the first
search ?—Twelve.

Where were they?—In a locked up press
in his dining-room.

How soon did you renew your search P—
One happened between eight and nine o’clock,
the other between twelve and one.

How many did you find at the second
search ?—Two pike-heads.

Blades?—Yes; and two battle-axes, and a

Pend you make any trial whether the blades
and the pole as you call it, would fit each
sother?—Yes.

Where is the pole?—It is here. [The wit-
ness produced it.]

Where did you deposit the several things
that you found at Watt’s house ?—At Mr.
Sheriff Clerke’s.

Were they locked up and deposited in his
care ?—They were in this box. [producing it.]

James Clerk, esq., sworn.—Examined by
. Mr. Garrow.

I believe you are sheriff of Edinburgh ?—

es.

Was that box, and the thing the witness
calls the pole, deposited in your care as she-
riff?—The pikes, he mentions, were depo-
sited in my care; they were in a locked-up
pine of mine froin the time that they were

found till the trials at Edinburgh ; when they
were carried down to be shown at the trials,
they were committed to the witness, who was
to produce them.

Except then when they were delivered to
Lockhart, they have been constantly locked
wp under your care ?—Yes, they have.

To Mr. Lockhart.—Did you return these to
the sheriff, which you had from him, after the
Edinburgh trials?—No; I have kept them in
my custody ever since.

And are these the same the sheriff delivered
to you ?—They are.

‘o Mr. Clerke—Is Stock still living at
Edinburgh, or has he absconded?—We av
made every search possible to apprehend him,
but without success.

Mr. Garrow to Mr, Lockhart.—Open the


rn

(876

box, and take out some of those blades. [Mr.
Lockhart opened the-box.]

Is that what you call the battle-axe ?—It
is. [The witness screwed it ona shail}

Ilave you got any other sort of blades
there?—Yes. [The witness produced some
pike-blades, shaped like a bayonet, unscrewed
the battle-axe, and screwed on a pike in its
stead.]

Mr. Garrow.—You Vain to me, in
taking one of these blades out, to screw off
something—what is that?—When that is
screwed off, it is rendered fit to attach to the
pole; when that is on, it forms a handle; so
that it may be used without a pole.

Mr. Attorney General.—Martin, in his
letter to Margarot, in Scotland, says, Gay
will tell you more than I dare mention. I
am going to read the account of Gay’s being
admitted a member of the Constitutional So-
ciety; he was proposed by Mr. Tooke, and
seconded by Mr. Bonney.

Evan Evans again called. .

Mr. Attorney General.—You mentioned a
person of the name of Gay, who was in the
King’s-bench prison?—Yes. -

Do you know where he lived before he
went into the King’s-bench prison?—I do
not. I think I should know if I heard it

tioned several times.

. Mr. Attorney General_—My Lord, I hav

Derence.

The Honourable Thomas Erskine.*—Gen-
tlemen of the Jury ;—Before I proceed to the
performance of the momentous duty which is
atlength cast upon me, I desire in the first
place to return my thanks to the Judges, for
the indulgence I have received in the opportu-
nity of addressing you at this later period of
the day, than the ordinary sitting of the Court;
when IJ have had the refreshment which na-
ture but too much required, and a few hours
retirement, to arrange a little in my mind that
immense matter, the result of which I must
now endeavour to lay before you.—I have to
thank you also, Gentlemen, for the very con-
descending and obliging manner in which you
so readily consented to this accommodation :—
the Court could only speak for itself, referring
me to you, whose rest and comforts had been
so long interrupted. I shall always remember
your kindness.

_ Before I advance to the regular considera-
tion of this great cause, either as it regards the
evidence or the law, I wish first to put aside
all that I find in the speech of my learned
friend, the attorney-general, which is either
collateral to the merits, or in which I can
agree with him.—-First then, tv THE NAME OP
THE PRISONER, and speaking Ais sentiments,
which are well known to be my own also, I
concur in the eulogium which you have heard
upon the constitution of our wise furefathers.
But before this eulogium can have any just
or useful application, we ought to reflect upon
shat it is which entitles this Constitution to the
praise so justly bestowed upon it. To say
nothing at present of its most essential excel-
lence, or rather the very soul of it, viz. the
share the people ought to have in their go-
vernment, by a pure representation, for the
assertion of which the Prisoner stands ar-
raigned asa traitor before you,—what is it that

* I have been indulged by Mr. Rogers, the
celebrated author of the Pleasures of Memory
and other poems, with Mr. Horne Tooke’s
copy of Hardy’s trial, where I find in Mr.
Tooke’s hand-writing at the end of this argu-
ment, the following remarkable note: ‘Tus
SPEECH WILL LIVE FOR EVEB.”


distinguishes the government of England
from the most despotic monarchies? What—
but the security which the subject enjoys in a
trial and judgment by. his equals; rendered
doubly secure as being part of a system of law
which no expediency can warp, and which no
power can abuse with impunity ?

To the Attorney General’s second prelimi-
hay observation, I equally agree.—I anxi-
ously wish with him that you shall bear in
memory the anarchy which is desolating
France.— Before I sit down, I may perhaps,
in my turn, have occasion to reflect’ a little
upon its probable causes; but waiting a sea-
son for such reflections, let us first consider
what the evil is which has been so feelingly
lamented, as having fallen on that unhappy
country.---It is, that under the dominion of a
barbarous state necessity, every protection of
law is abrogated and destroyed ;—it is, that
no man can say, under such a system of alarm
and terror, that his life, his liberty, his repu-
tation, or any one human blessing, is secure
to him fora moment: it is, that, if accused
of federalism, or moderatism, or incivism, or
of whatever else the change fashions and
factions of the day shall have lifted up into
high treason against the State, he must see
his friends, his family, and the light of heaven,
no more :—the accusation and the sentence
being the same: following one another as the
thunder pursues the flash. Such has been the
state of England,—such is the state of France:
and how then, since they are introduced to
you for application, ought they in reason and
sobriety to. be applied? If this prosecution
has been commenced (as is asserted) to avert
from Great Britain the calamities incident to
civil confusion, leading in its issues to the de-
plorable condition of France ; I call upon you,
gentlemen, to avert such calamity from fall
ing upon my client, and through his side upon
yourselves and upon our country.—Let not
him suffer under vague expositions of tyran-
nical laws, more tyrannically executed.—Let
not him be hurried away to pre-doomed-exe-
cution, from an honest enthusiasm for the
public safety.—I ask for hima trial by this
applauded constitution of our country :—I call
upon you to administer the law to him, ac-
cording to our own wholesome institutions,
by its strict and rigid letter. However you
may eventually disapprove of any part of his
conduct, or viewing it through a false medium,
may think it even wicked, I claim for him, as
a subject of England, that the law shall decide
upon its criminal denomination :—I protest,
in his name, against all appeals to speculations
concerning consequences, when the law com-
mands us to look only to vtentions.—If the

state be threatened with evils, let parliament
administer a prospective remedy, but let the
prisoner hold his life uNDER THE Law. +

. Gentlemen, I ask this solemnly of the
Court, whose Justice I am persuaded will af-
ford it to me; I ask it more emphatically of
you, the jury, who are called upon your oaths

to make @ true deliverance of your country-
man, from this Pele :—but lastly, and
chiefly, I implore it of aim in whose hands
are all the issues of life; whose humane and
merciful eye expands itself over all the trans-
actions of mankind; at whose command na-
tions rise, and fall, and are regenerated ; with-
out whom nota sparrow falleth to the ground ;
—I implore it of God himself, that He will
fill your minds with the spirit of, justice and
of truth ; so that you may be able to find your
way through the labyrinth of matter laid be-
fore you, a labyrinth in which no man’s life
was ever before involved, in the annals of
British trial, nor indeed in the whole history
of human justice or injustice,

Gentlemen, the first thing in order, is to
look at the indictment itself; of the whole of
which, or of some integral part, the prisoner
must be found guilty, or be wholly discharged
from guilt.

_ The indictment charges that the prisoners
did’ maliciously and traitorously conspire,
compass, and imagine, to bring and put our
lord the king to death ; and that to fulfil, per-
fect, and bring to effect, their most evil and
wicked purpose (that is to suy, of bringing and
putting the king to death), “they met, con-
spired, consulted, and agreed amongst them-
selves, and other false traitors unknown, to
cause and procure a convention to be assemr
bled within the kingdom, WITH INTENT—”
(Lam reading the very words of the indict-
ment, which I entreat you to follow in the
notes you have been taking with such honest
perseverance)—“ WITH INTENT, AND IN
ORDER that the persons so assembled at
such convention, should and might traitor
ously, and in defiance of the authority, and

ast the will of Parliament, subvert and

‘er, and cause to be subverted and altered,
the legislature, rule, and government of the
country, and to depase king from the
royal. state, Ute, power, and government
thereof.” This is the first and great lead-
ing overt act in the indictment; and you
observe that it js not charged as being trea-
SOD SUBSTANTIVELY AND IN ITSELF; but only
ag itis committed in pursuance of the trea-
son against the king’s Penson, antecedently
imputed ;—for the charge is nor, that the
prisoners conspired to assemble a conven-
tion to nerose the king, but that they.
conspired and compassed his peatH; and
that, in order to accomplish that wicked and
detestable purpose, i. ¢, in order to fulfil the
traitorous intention of the mind against his LiFe,
they conspired to assemble aconvention, with
a view to depose him. The same ol tion
applies alike to all the other counts or overt
ais upon the record, which manifestly indeed

forgotten, use they also un! ly charge
sie different acts as committed in fulfilment
of the same traitorous purpose, To BRING THE
xInG ‘To pEaTH. You will therefore have
three distinct matters for consideration, upon
this trial: First, What share (if any) the pr-
soner had, in concert with others, in assem-
bling any convention or meeting of subjects
within this eingsom :—Secondly, What were
the acts to be done by this convention, when
assem Hledsan a a Thirdly, Yibat was deve,
purpose, and intention of those who project-
ed its, existence, This third iderati
indeed, comprehends, or rather precedes and
swallows up the other two ; because, before it
can be material to decide upon the views of
the convention, as pointed to the subversion
of the rale.and order of the king’s political
authority (even if such views could be ascrib-
ed to it, and brought home even personally to
ae meat ‘aa shall have to cenit whe
ther that crimina).conspiracy, against the esta-
blished.order of the community, was hatched
and; engendered by a wicked. contemplation
to.destroy the natural life and person of the
king, and whether the acts and
established by the evidence, were done ia
pursuance and in fulfilment of the same traitor
ous purpose, .
Gentlemen, this view of the subject is not
only correct, but self evident.—The subver-
sion of the King’s political government, and
all, conspiracies to subvert it, are crimes of
po magnitude and enormity, which the
law is open tq punish; bu¢ neither of them ore
the crimes before you.—The prisoner is xor
charged with a conspiracy against the King’s
POLITICAL GOVERNMENT, but against his sa
TURAL L1FB, He is not. accused of having
merely taken sepa te depose him from hisau-
thority, but with having done so with theinter
tion te bring him to death.—It is the act with
the specific intention, and not the act alone,
which constitutes a charge.—The act ‘a
cqnspiring to depose the King, indeed
evidence, according to cirousastaces, of an
intention to destroy his natural existence,
but never, as a proposition of aw, can const
tute the intention itself—Where an act
done in pursuance of an intention, surely the
intention must first-exist; a man cannot dos
thing in fulfilment of an intention, unless his
mind. first conceives that intention.—Th
ing an act, or the pursuit of a system of
conduct, which leads in probable consequences
to the death of the King, may legally (if 0
such be. hefore.you) affect the consideration
of the traitorous perpoes
raid

questions
w

quences unconnected even with intention or
consciousness, shall be synonymous in law
with the traitorous mind; although the trai-
torous mind alone is arraigned, as constitut-
ing the crime, .

Gentlemen, the first question consequently
for consideration, and to which I must there-
fore earnestly implore the attention of the
Court, is this: — WaT 18 THE LAW UPON
THIS MOMENTOUS SUBJECT? --- And recollect-
ing that Iam invested with no authority, I
shall not presume to offer you any thing of
my own ;---nothing shall proceed from my-
self upon this part of the inquiry, but that
which is merely introductory, and necessary
to the understanding of the authorities on
which I mean to rely for the establishment
of doctrines, not less essential to the general
liberties of England, than to the particular
Sonsivertcn which constitutes our present

uty.

First then, I maintain that that branch of
the statute 95th of Edward Srd, which
declares it to be high treason “ when a man
doth compass or imagine the death of the King,
of his lady the Queen, or of his eldest son and
heir,” was intended to guard by a higher sanc-
tion than felony, the Naturat tives of the
King, Queen, and Prince ; and that no act,
therefore (cither inchoate or consummate),
of resistance to, or rebellion ugainst, the King’s
regal capucity, amounts to high treason of
compassing his death, unless where they can
be charged upon the indictment, and proved
to the satisfaction of the Jury at the trial, as
overt acts, committed by the prisoner, in ful-
Silment of a traitorous intention to destroy the
King’s NaTuRAL LIFE. :

Secondly, that the compassing the King’s
death, or, in other words, the traitorous in-
tention to destroy his natural existence, is the
treason, and not the overt acts, which are
only laid as manifestations of the traitorous
intention, or, in other words, a3 EVIDENCE
competent to be left to a Jury to prove it;
and that no conspiracy to levy war aguinst
the King, nor any conspiracy against his regal
character or capacity, is a good overt act of
cempassing Ais death, unless some force be
exerted, or in contemplation against tr
Krno’s Person: and that such force so exerted
or in contemplation, is not substantively the
treason of compassing, but only competent in
point of law to establish it, if the Jury, by the
verdict of Guilty, draw that conclusion of fact
from the evidence of the overt act.

Thirdly, that the charge in the Indictment,
of compassing the King’s death, is not laid as
legal inducement or introduction, to follow as
a legal inference from the establishment of
the overt act, but is laid as an averment of a
Fact; and, as such, the very gist of the In-
dictment, to be affirmed or negatived by the
verdict of Guilty or Not Guilty. It will not
(iam persuaded) be suspected by the Attor-
ney-General, or by the Court, that Iam about
to support these doctrines by oppusing my


een are a

own putgarent to the authoritative writings
of the venerable and excellent lord Hale,
whose memory will live in this country, and
pete the enlightened world, as long as
the administration of pure justice shall exist :
neither do I wish to oppose any thing which
is to be found in the other learned authori-
ties principally relied upon by the Crown, be-
cause all my positions are perfectly consistent
with a right interpretation of them ; and be-
cause, even were it otherwise, I could not ex-
pect successfully to oppose them by any rea-
sonings of my own, which can have no
weight, but as they shall be found at once
consistent with acknowledged authorities, and
with the established principles of the English
law.—I can do this with the greater security,
because my respectable and learned friend,
the Attorney Gencral, has not cited cases
which have been the disgrace of this country
in former times, nor asked you to sanction by
your judgment those bloody murders, which
are recorded by them as acts of English jus-
tice; but, as might be expected of an honour-
able man, his expositions of the law (though
I think them frequently erroneous) are drawn
from the same sources, to which I look up for
doctrines so very different.—-I find, indeed,
throughout the whole range of authorities (£
mean those which the attorney-general has pro-
perly considered as deserving that name and
character) very little contradiction; for, as
far as I can discover, much more entangle-
ment has arisen from now and then a trip-
ping in the expression, than from any dif-
ference of sentiment amongst eminent and
virtuous judges, who have either examined,
or sat in judgment upon this momentous sub-
ject.

Gentlemen, before I purste the course
T have prescribed to myself, I desire most
distinctly to be understood, that in my own
opinion the most successful argument, that a
conspiracy to ag the king does not ne-
cessarily establish the treason charged upon
this record, 1s TOTALLY RESIDE ANY POSSIBLE
JYUDGMENT THAT YOU CAN HAVE TO FORM
UPON THE EVIDENCE BEFORE YOU; since
throughout the whole volumes that have been
read, I can trace nothing that even points to
the imagination of such a conspiracy; and
consequently the doctrines of Coke, Male,
and Foster, on the subject of high treason,
might equally be detailed in any other trial
that has ever been proceeded upon in this
place. But, Gentlemen, I stand in a fearful
and delicate situation.--As a suppesed attack
upon the king’s civil authority has been
transmuted, by construction, into a murderous
conspiracy against his natural person ; in the
same manner, and by the same arguments, a
conspiracy to overturn that civil authority,
by direct force, has again been assimilated,
by farther construction, to a design to under-
mine monarchy by changes wrought through
public opinion, enlarging gradually into unt-
versal will; so that Ican adinit no false pro-

3.1L

position, however wide I may think it of ra-
tional application.--For as there is a con-
STRUCTIVE COMPaSsING, so also there is a
CONSTRUCTIVE DEPosING ; and I cannot, there-
fore, possibly know what either of them is
separately, nor how the one may be argued to
involve the other.--There are, besides, many
risoners, whose cases are behind, and whose
Tees may be involved in your present delibe-
ration ; their names have been already stig-
matized, and their conduct arraigned in the
evidence you have heard, as a part of’ the con-
irucy.—It is these considerations which
rive me into so large a field of argument,
because, by sufficiently ascertaining the law
in the outset, they who are yet looking up to
it Pr protection, may not be brought into
eril.
a Gentlemen, I now proceed to establish,
that a compassing of the death of the king,
within the twenty-fifth of Edward the third,
which is the charge against the prisoner, con-
sists in a traitorous intention against his
NATURAL Lire; and that nothing short of
your firm belief of that detestable intention,
from overt acts which you find him to have
committed, can justify his conviction. That
I may keep my word with you in building my
argument upon nothing of my own, I hope
my friend Mr. Gibbs will have the goodness
to call me back, if he finds me wanderin;
from my engagement; that I ma: ineded
step by step upon the most venerable and ac-
knowledged authorities of the law.

In this process I shall begin with lord
Hale, who opens this important subject by
stating the reason of passing the statute of the
twenty-fifth of Edward the third, on which
the indictment is founded.—Lord Hale says,
in his Pleas of the Crown, vol. i. page 82,
that “ at common law there was a great lutitude
sed in raising offences to the crime and punish-
ment of treason, by way of interpretation and

arbitrary construction, which brought in |

great uncertainty and confusion. Thus ac-
croaching, i, €. ENCROACHING ON ROYAL POWER
was an usual charge of treason anciently, though
a very uncertain charge; so that no man could
tell what it was, or what defence to make to it.”
Lord Hale then goes on to state various in-
stances of vexation and cruelty, and concludes
with this striking observation : “ by these and
the like instances that might be given, it appears
how ARBITRARY AND UNCERTAIN the law of
treason wus before the statute of 25th of Edward
the IIIrd, whereby it came to pass that almost
every offence that was, or seemed to be, a breach
of the faith and allegiance due to the king, was

CONSTRUCTION, CONSEQUENCE, and INTER-
PRETATION, faised into the offence of high
treason.” This is the lamentation of the great
Hale upon the state of this country previous
to the passing of the statute, which, he says,
‘was passed as 4 REMEDIAL law, to put an end
to them; and Jord Coke, considering it in the
same light, says, in his third Institute, page
2nd, “ the parliament which passed this statute


was called (as it well deserved) parliomenta
benedictum ; and the like honour was given
to it by the different statutes which from tim
to time brought back treasons to its standart,
all agreeing in magnifying and extolling thi
blessed Act.”—Now this statute, which bs
obtained the: panegyric of these great mer,
whom the Chief Justice in his Charge looked
up to for light and fur example, and wha
the Attorney General takes also for his guide,
would very little have deserved the hig)
eulogium bestowed upon it, if, though avov-
edly passed to destroy uncertainty in crimim!
justice, and to beat down the arbitrary con-
structions of Judges, lamented by Hale, asdi-
figuring and dishonouring the law, 4t had,
vertheless, been so worded as to give birth »
new constructions and uncertainties, inste:!
of destroying the old ones.—It would bul
have entitled itself to the denomination of s
blessed statute, if it had not, in its enacting
letter, which professed to remove doubts, até
to ascertain the law, made use of expressions
the best known and understood; and it wll
be found accordingly, that it cautiously did
It will be found, that, in selecting the expre-
sion of coMPASSING THE DEATH, it employeda
term of the most fixed and ne
cation in the language of English law, which
not only no judge or counsel, but which »
attorney or attorney’s clerk, could misunder-
stand; because in former ages, before the
statute, compassing the death of any mar
had been a felony, and what had amounted 0
such compassing, had been settled in a thousen
instances. To establish this, and to show
also, by no reasoning of mine, that the term
“ compassing the death” was intended by the
statute, when applied to the King, as higi
treason, to have the same signification asit
had obtained in the law when applied to the
subject as a felony, I shall refer to Mr. Justice
Foster, and even to a passage cited by the
Attorney General himself, which speaks ©
unequal and unanswerably for itself, 3
to mock all ,commentary.—“ The ancieal
writers,” says Foster, “ in treating of felonums
homicide, considered the felonious INTENTION
manifested by plain facts, in the same light, ®
point of guilt, as homicide itself. —The rule ras.
VOLUNTAS REPUTATUR PRO Facto; and hile
this rule prevailed, the nature of the offence 2%
expressed by the term COMPASSING THE DEATH.
This rule has been long laid aside as too rigorms
in the case of common persons ; but in the cax of
the Kinc, Queen, and Prince, the statute of
treasons has, with great propricty, RETAINtD®
in its full extent and vigour ; and in describing
the offence, has likewise RETAINED the ancient
mode of expression, when a man doth compass ©
imagine the death of our lord the king, §¢. and
thereof be upon sufficient proof, procablemesl,
attainted of open decd, by people of his condition:
the words of the statute descriptive of the ofentt,
must, THEREFORY, 6¢ strictly pursued in cvry
indictment for this species of treason.—It MUST
charge that the defendant did traitorously cot

and imagine the king’s death ; and then go |

Seand charge the several acts made use of by the
prisoner to effectuate his trattorous purpose;
YOR THE COMPASSING THE KING’S DEATH ISTHE
treason, and the overt acts are charged as the
means made use of to effectuate the intentions
and imaginations of the heart ; and therefore,
in the case of the regicides, the indictment
charged that they did traiturously compass and
imagine the death of the king, and the cutting
off the head wus laid as the overt act, and the
person who was supposed to have given the mortal
aroke was convicted on the same indictment.”

_This concluding instance, though at first
view it may appear ridiculous, is well selected
as an illustration; because, though in that
case there could be no possible doubt of the
intention, since the act of a deliberate execu-
tion involves, in common sense, the intention
to destroy life, yet still the anomaly of the
offence, which exists wholly in the rNTENTION,
and not in the overt act, required the preser-
vation of the form of the indictment.—It is
surely impossible to read this commentary of
Foster, without seeing the true purpose of the
statute: the common law had anciently con-
sidered, even in the case of a fellow-subject,
the malignant intention to destroy, as equiva-
lent to the act itself; but that noble spirit of
humanity which pervades the whole system of
our jurisprudence, had, before the time of
king Edward the third, eat out and destroyed
this rule, too rigorous in its general applica-
tion; but, as Foster truly observes in the
passage I have read—“ This rule, too rigorous
inthe case of the subject, the statute of trea-
sons RETAINED in the case of the king, and
RETAINED ALSO THE VERY EXPRESSION used by
the law when compassing the death of a sub-
Ject was felony.”

The statute, therefore, being expressly made
‘© remove doubts; and accurately to define
treason, adopted the ancient expression of the
common law, as applicable to felonious homi-
cide, meaning that the life of the sovereign

Id remain an exception, and that vorun-

Tas PRo Facro, the wicked intention for the
deed itself (as it regarded his sacred life),
should continue for the rule: and, therefore,
says Foster, the statute meaning to RETAIN
the law which was before general, RETAINED
also the expression. It appears to me, there-
fore, incontrovertible, not only by the words
of the statute itself, but upon the authority of
Foster, which I shall follow up by that of
lord Coke and Hale, contradicted by no syl-
le in their works, as I shall demonstrate,
that the statute, as it regarded the security of
king’s tirz, did not mean to enact a new
security never known to the common law in
other cases, but meant to suffer a common
law rule which formerly existed universally,
which was precisely known, but which was
too severe in common cases, to remain as an
copton in favour of the king’s security —I
do therefore positively maintain, NoT aS AN
ADVOCATE MERELY, but IN MY OWN PERSON,


that, within the letter and meaning of the
statute, nothing can be a compassing the
death of the king that would not, in ancient
times, have been a felony in the case of a
subject; for otherwise Foster and Coke, as
will be seen, are very incorrect when they say
the statute reTarnep the old law, and the
appropriate word to express it; for if it went
BEYOND IT, it would, on the contrary, have
been a newrule unknown to the common
law, enacted, for the first time, for the preser-
vation of the king’s life. Unquestionably the
legislature might have made such a rule; but
we are not inquiring what it mixit have en-
acted, but what it Aas enacted. But I ought
to ask pardon for having relapsed into any
argument of my own upon this subject, when
the authorities are more express to the pur-
pose than any language I can use; for Mr.
Justice Foster bimee f expressly says, Discourse
descriptive of the offence, viz. ‘if a man doth
* compass or imagine, and thereof be attainted of
‘open deed, are plainly borrowed from the
common law, and therefore must bear the same
construction they did at common law.”—Is this
distinct ?—I will read it to you again: “ all
the words descriptive of the offence, viz. ‘ if a
“man doth compass or imagine, and thereof be
‘ attainted of open deed, are plainly borrowed
Jrom the common law, and therefore must bear
the same construction they did at common law.”
Gentlemen, Mr. Justice Foster is by no
means singular in this doctrine.—Lord Coke,
the oracle of the law, and the best oracle one
can consult, when standing for a prisoner
charged with treason, as he was the highest
prerogative lawyer that ever existed, maintains
the same doctrine—even He, even Coke, the
infamous prosecutor of Raleigh,* whose cha-
racter with posterity,as an attorney general, my
worthy and honourable friend would disdain to
hold, to be author of all his valuable works ;
yet even this very lord Coke himself, holds
precisely the same language with Foster.—
For, in ie commentary on this statute, in his
third Institute, p. 5, when he comes to the
word, “ porn compass,” he says, “ Let us see
first what the compassing the death of a sub
secT was before the making of this statute, ©
when voluntas reputabatur pro facto.”—Now
what is the plain English of this?—The com-
mentator says, I am going to instruct you, the
student, who are to learn from me the law of
England, what is a compassing of the death
of the Kine; but that I cannot do, but by first
carrying you to look into what was the com-
passing of the death of a sussect at the an-
cient common law ; because the statute hav-
ing made a compassing, as applied to the
Kino, the crime of high treason, which, at
common law, was felony in the case of a suB~
sect, it is impossible to-define the one, with-
out looking back to the records which illus-
—_———_$—

® See sir Walter Raleigh’s case in this Col~

trate the orneR.—This is so directly the train '
of Jord Coke's reasoning, that in his own sin- |
gularly precise style of commentating, he im-

mediately lays betore his reader a variety of |
instances from the ancient records and year- |
books, of compassing the susscct’s DLATH; '
and what are they ?—Not acts wholly colla-

teral to attacks upon life, dogmatically laid ;
down by the law trom speculations upon pro- |
bable or possible consequences; but assaults :
WITH INTENT TO MURDER ;—conspiracies to
waylay the person with the saME INTENTION;
and other MuRpERoUs muchinations,—These
were the only compassings before the statute,
against the subject’s life; and the extension
of the expression was never heard of in the |
Jaw till introduced by the craft of political ;
judges, when it became applicable to crimes |
against tue Srate.—Lere again I desire to |
appeal to the highest authorities for this
source of constructive treasons; for although :
the statute of Edward urd had expressly di-

rected that nothing should be doclapel to be

treason but cases within its enacting letter,

yet lurd Hale says, in his Pleas of the Cruwn, |
page 83, that “ dings were so carried by PaRr-
TIFS aud FACTIONS, in the succeeding reign of
Richard 2nd, thué this statute was but little
observed, but as this or that party got the better.
—So the crime of high treason was in a manner
arbitrarily unposed und adjudged, to the disud-
pantace of the party that was to be judged ;
which, by vartous vicissitudes and revolutions,
mischicfed all parties first and lust, and left a
reat unsetiledness and unquictness in the minds
Of the people, and was one of the occasions vf the
unhappiness of that King.

“ All this mischief was produced by the sta-
“te of the Qist uf Richard 2nd, which enacted,
L.. ‘every man that compusseth or pursueth the
of the King, on To DEPOSE HIM, OR TO
RENDER UP HIS HOMAGE LIEGE, or he that
raiscth people, and rideth against the King, to
make war within kis realm, and of that be nvty
altainted and adjudged, shall be adjudged a
traitor, of high treason against the crown,

“ This,” says lord Hale, “ was a great snare
to the subject, insomuck that the statute 1st of
Henry 4th, which repealed it, recited that no
man knew how he ought to behave himself, to do,

speak, or say, for doubt of such puins of trea-
son: and therefore, wholly to remove the preju-
dice, which might come tothe king’s subjects, the
statute 1st of Henry 4th chap. 10, was made
WHICH BROUGHT BaCK TREASON TO THE STAN-
DARD or THE 25TH OF Epwarp Srp.”

Now if we look to this statute of Richard
2nd, which produced such mischiefs—what
are they ?—As far asit re-cnacted the treason
of compassing the King’s death, and levying
war, it only re-cuacted the statute of Edward
Srd, but it went beyond it by the loose con-
struction of compassing to depose the King,
and raising the people, and riding to make
war, or acompassing to depose him, Terms
NEW TO THE COMMON Law. The actual levying
of force, to imprison or depose the King, was al-


ready and properly high treason, within the
second branch of the statute; but this statute
of Richard 2nd enlarged only the crime of
compussing, making it extend to acompassing
to imprison or depose, which are the great

objects of an actual levying of war, and mak-.

ing a compassing to levy war, on a footing
with the actual levying it.—It seems, there-
fore most astonishing, that any judge could
be supposed to have decided, as an abstract
rule of daw, that a compassing to imprison or
depose the king was high treason, sunstas-
TIVELY, WITHOUT PREVIOUS COMPASSING OP
HIS DEATH: since it was made so by this sta-
tute, 21st of Richard 2nd, and reprobated, stig-
matized, and repealed by the statute 1st of
Henry 4th, chap. 10. “ And so little effect,”
says Mr. Justice Blackstone, “ have over-vio-
lent laws to prevent any crime, that within two

| years after this new luw of treason respecting

imprisonment and deposing, this very prince wes
both deposed and murdered.”

Geutlemen, this distinction, made by the
humane statute of Edward 3rd, between trea-
son against the king’s natural life, and _rebel-
lion against his civil authority, and winch the
act of Richard 2nd, for a season, bruke down,
is founded in wise and sound policy.—.\ suc-
cesstul attack may be made upon the king's
person by the malignity of an individual, wi
out the combination of extended conspiracy,
or the exertions of rebellious force; the law
therefore justly stands upon the watch to
crush the first overt manifestation of so evil
and detestable a purpose—Considering the
life of the chief magistrate as infinitely im-
portant tothe public security, it does not wait
for the possible consummation of a crime,
which requires neither time, combination, nor
force to accomplish, but considers the traitor.
ous purpose as a consummated treason: but
the wise and humane policy of our foretathers
extended the severity of the rule, coluntas pro

facto, no farther than they were thus impelled

and justified by the necessity; and therefore
an intention to levy war and rebellion, not
consummated, however manifested by the most
overt acts of conspiracy, was not declared to
be treason, and upon the plainest pricciple in
the world ; the king’s rEGaL capacity, guarded
by all the force and authority of the state,
could not like his NatuRAL existence, be
overthrown or endangered in a moment, by
the first machinations of the traitorous mind
of an individual, or even by the unarmed con-
spiracy of numbers; and therefore this hu-
mane and exalted institution, measuring the
sanctions of criminal justice by the standard
of civil necessity, thought it sufficient to
scourge and dissipate unarmed conspirators
by a less vindictive proceeding.

These new treasons were, however, st.
length all happily swept away on the acces-
sion of king Henry 4th, which brought the
law back to the standard of Edward srd ;and,
indeed, in reviewing the history of this highly
favoured island, it is most beautiful, and, at

the same time, highly encouraging to observe,
by what an extraordinary concurrence of cir-
cumstances, under the superintendence of ay
benevolent Providence, the liberties of our
country have been established.—Amidst the
convulsions, arising from the maddest ambi-
tion and injustice, and whilst the state was
alternately departing from its poise, on one
side, and on the other, the great rights of
mankind were still insensibly taking root and
flourishing ; — though sometimes monarch
threatened to lay them prostrate, thoug!
aristocracy occasionally undermined them,
and democracy, in her turn, rashly trampled
on them, yet they have ever come safely
round at last.—This awful and sublime con-
templation should teach us to bear with one
another when our opinions do not quite coin-
cide; extracting final harmony from the ine-
vitable differences which ever did, and ever
must exist amongst men.

Gentlemen, the act of Henry 4th was
scarcely made when it shared the same fate
with the vencrable law which it restored. —
Nobody regarded it.—It was borne down by
factions, and, in those days, there were no
judges, as there are now, to hold firm the ba-
Jance of justice amidst the storms of state ;—
men could not then, as the prisoner can to-
day, look up for protection to magistrates in-
dependent of the crown, and awfully account-
able in character to an enlightened world.—
As fast as arbitrary constructions were abo-
lished by one statute, unprincipled judges be-
gan to build them up again, till they were
beat down by another: to recount their
strange treasons would be tiresome and dis-

gusting; but their system of construction, in
the teeth of positive law, may be well illus-
trated by two lines from Pope.

“« Destroy his fib and sophistry, in vain,
«« The creature's at his dirty work again.”

This system, both judicial and parliamen-
tary, became indeed so intolerable, in the


and repeal all, but only such as ure specified
and expressed in this statute of Edward
8rd. By which law the safety of both the
King and of the subject, and the prescrcation
of the common weal, were wisely and sufficiently
provided for, and in such certuinty, that nihil
relictum est arbitrio judicis.” The whole evil,
indeed, to be remedied and avoided by the act
of Queen Mary was, the arsitnium Jupicts,
or judicial construction beyond the Letrer of
the statute.—-The statute itself was perfect,
and was restored in its full vigour; and to
suppose, therefore, that when an act was ex-
pressly made, because judges had built trea-
sons by constructions beyond the law, they
were to be left, consistently with their duty,
to go on building acarn, is to impute a folly
to the legislature, which never yet was im-
puted to the framers of this admirable statute.
But this absurd idea is expressly excluded,
not merely by the statute, according to its’
plain interpretation, but according to the
direct authority of lord Coke himself, in his
commentary upon it. For he goes on to say,
“ Two things are to be observed ; first, that the
word EXPRESSED, in the statute of Maury, ex-
cludes all IMPLICATIONS OR INFERENCES WHAT=
SOEVER; secondly, that no former attainder,
judgment, precedent, resolution, or opinion of
judges, or justices, of high treason, other than
such as are specified and expressed in the sta-
tute of Edward 3rd, are to be followed or
drawn into example—For the words be plain
and direct ; that from henceforth no act, deed,
or offence shall be taken, hud, deemed or ad-
judged to be high treason, but only such as are
declared and expressed in the suid act of the
25th of Edward 3rd, any act of parliament or
statute ufter 25th of Edward 3rd, or any other
declaration or matter, to the contrary notwith-
standing.”

Gentlemen, if the letter of the statute of
Mary, when coupled with lord Coke's com-
mentary, required farther illustration, it would
amply receive it from the pRrAMBLE, which

interval between the reign of Henry 4th,| ought to be engraved on the heart of every
and that of Philip and Mary, that it produced, | man who loves the king, or who is called to

in the first year of the latter reign, the most
remarkable statute that ever passed in Eng-
land, repealing not only all former statutes
upon the subjcct, except that of Edward Srd,
but also stigmatizing, upon the records
of Parliament, the arbitrary constructions of
Judges, and limiting them, in all times, to
every LETTER of the statute. I will read to
you lord Coke’s commentary upon the sub-
ject. In_his third Institute, page 23, he
says,-—“ Before the act of the 25th of Edward

3rd, so many treasons had been made and
declared, and in such sort penned, as not only
the ignorant und unlearned people, but also
learned and cxrpert men, were trapped and
snared. Thus the great mischief before Edward
3rd, of the uncertainty of what was trea-
son and what not, became so frequent and
dangerous, as that the safest and surest remedy
was by this excellent act of Mary to abrogate

t any share in his councils; for, as lord Coke

observes, in the same commentary : it truly
recites, that “ the state of a king stundeth and
consisteth more assured by the love und favour of
the subjects towards their Suvercign, than in the
dread and feurs of laws, made with rigorous
and extreme punishment ; and that luws, justl
made for the preservation of the common weal,
without extreme punishment or penalty, are
more often and for the most part better kept
and obeyed, thun laws and statutes made with
extreme punishment.”

But, Gentlemen, the most important part
of lord Coke’s commentary on this statute is’
yet behind, which I shall presently read to.
you, and to which I implore your most
earnest attention; because I will show yout
by it, that the unfortunate man, whose inno-
cence I am defending, is arraigned before you
of high treason, upon evidence not only

wholly repugnant to this particular statute, | in trials for other crimes, on the contrary, the
but such as never yet was heard of in England | legislature did not even leave it to the ju

upon any capital trial:---evroence which,
even with all the attention you have given to
it, I defy any one of you, at this moment, to
say of what it consists ;---evipence, which
(since -it_ must be called by that name) I
tremble for my boldness in presuming to stand
up for the life of a man, when I am conscious
that I am incapable of understanding from it,
even what acts are imputed to him ;—£v1-
pencr, which has consumed four days in the
reading ;---not in reading the acts of the pri-
soncr, but the unconnected writings of men,
unknown to one another, upon a hundred dif-
ferent subjects;---evipence, the very listen-
ing to which has deprived me of the sleep
which nature requires ;—which has filled my
mind with See ig distress and agitation,
and which, from its discordant unconnected
nature, has suffered me to reap no advantage
from the indulgence, which I began with
thanking you for; but which, on the contrary,
has almost set my brain on fire, with the vain
endeavour of collecting my thoughts upon a
ee never designed for any rational course
of thinking.

Let us, therefore, see how the unexampled
condition I am placed in falls in with Tord
Coke ays this subject, whose authority is
appealed to by the Crown itself; and let us

home and burn our books if they are to
lazon forth the law by eulogium, and accu-
rately to define its protection, which yet the
subject is to be totally cut off from, when,
even under the sanction of these very au-
thors, he stands upon his trial for his exist-
ence. Lord Coke says, in the same commen-
tary, page 12, that the statute had not only
accurately defined the care, but the nature
of the proor on which alone a man shall be
attainted of any of the branches of high trea-
son,—“ It is to be observed,” says he, “ that
the word in the act of Edward Srd is prove-
ABLEMENT: i. ¢€, Upon direct and manifest
Proof, not upon conjectural presumptions, or in-
JSerences, or strains of, wit, but upon good and
sufficient proof. And herein the adverb prove~
ABLY hath a great force, and signifieth a DI-
RECT PLAIN proof, which word the Lords
and Commons in Parliament did use, Sor that
the offence of treason was so heinous, and was
80 heavily and severely punished, as none other
the like, and therefore the offender must be
PROVEABLY attainted, which words are as
forcible as upon direct and manifest proof.
Note, the word is not PROBABLY, for then com.
mune argumentum might have served, but the
word is PRoveaBLy be attainted.”

Nothing can be so curiously and tautolo-
gously laboured as this commentary, of even

at great prerogative lawyer lord Coke, upon
this emgle word in the statute; and it mani-
festly shows, that, so far from its being the
spirit and principle of the law of England, to
loosen the construction of this statute, and to
adopt rules of construction and proof, unusual

to apply the ordinary rules of legal (")
tele ander it, but ciionialied” thee t do
justice in that respect in the very body of the
statute.

Lord Hale treads in the same path with lord
Coke, and concludes this part of the subject
by the following most remarkable passage~
vol. i. chap. xi. 86.

“ Now although the crime of high treason
the greatest crime against faith, duty, ond
human society, and brings with it the greatet
and most fatal dangers to the government,
peace, and happiness of a kingdom, or stale;
and, therefore, is deservedly branded with the
highest ignominy, and subjected to the greatet
penalties that the laws can inflict, it appesrs,
first, how necessary it was that there should ke
some KNOWN, FIXED, SETTLED boundary for this
great crime of treason, and of what great im-
portance the statute of 25th of Ed:card Srd wet,
iu order to that end. Second, How dangerous
it is to depart from the LETTER of that state,
and to multiply and enhance crimes into treasn
by ambiguous and general words, such as ac-
croaching royal power, subverting fundamental
laws, and the like-—And third, how dangerous
it is by construction, and ANALOGY, to
MAKE treasons where the LETTER of the law ha
not done it.---For such a method admits of 1
limits, or bounds, but runs as far ard as wide
as the wit and invention of accusers, and the
detestation of persons accused, will carry men.”

Surely the admonition of this supereminent
lawyer ought to sink deep into the heart of
every judge, and of every juryman, who is
called to administer justice under this statute;
above all, in the times and under the
circumstances which assemble us in this place.
—Honourable men, feeling, as they ought,
for the ny of government, and the tram
quillity of the country, and naturally indig-
nant against those who are supposed to have
brought them into peril, ought from that very
cause to proceed with more abundant caution,
lest they should be surprised by their resent
ments or their fears; they ought to i iesea |
in the judgments they form, by slow
trembling steps;—they ought even to fall
back and look at every thing again, lest a
false light should deceive them, admitting no
fact but upon the foundation of clear and pre-
cise evidence, and deciding upon no intention
that does not result with equal clearness from
the fact—This is the universal demand of
justice in every case criminal or civil;—how
much more especially then in this, when the
judgment is every moment in danger of
swept away into the fathomless abyss of 3
thousand volumes; where there is no apcho-

e for the understanding; where no reach
of thought can look round in order to com
pare their points; nor any memory be
cious enough to retain even the im
relation that can be collected from them?

Gentlemen, my is the more

affected with this consideration by a very re-
cent example in that monstrous phenomenon
which, under the name of a trial, has driven
us out of Westminster-Hall for a large portion
of my professional life.*—No man is less dis-
posed than I am to speak lightly of great state
prosecutions, which bind to their duty those
who have no other superiors, nor any other
control; least of allam I capable of even glanc-
ing a censure against those who have led to
or conducted the impeachment, because I re-
spect and love many of them, and know them
to be amongst the best and wisest men in the
nation.—I know them indeed so wellas to
be persuaded that could they have foreseen the
vast field it was to open, andthe length of time

it was to occupy, they never would have en- '

gaged init; for I defy any man, not enlight-
ened by the divine spirit, to say, with the pre-
cision and certainty of an English judge de-
ciding upon evidence before him, that Mr.
Hastings is guilty or not guilty:—for who
knows what is before him, or what is not?—
Many have carried what they knew to their

ves, and the living have lived long enough
to forget it—Indeed 1 pray God that such
another proceeding may never exist in Eng-
land; because I consider it as a dishonour to
the constitution, and that it brings, by its ex-
ample, insecurity into the administration of
justice +. Every man in civilized society has
aright to hold his life, liberty, property and
reputation, under plain laws that can be well
understood, and is intitled to have some limi-
ted specific part of his conduct, compared and
examined by their standard; but he ought
not for seven years, no, nor for seven days, to
stand as a criminal before the highest hunan
tribunal until judgment is bewildered and con-
founded, to come at last, perhaps, to defend
himself, broken down with fatigue, and dis-
pirited with anxiety, which, indecd, is my own
condition at this moment, who am only stat-
ing the case of another—What then must be
the condition of the unfortunate person whom
you are trying?

The next great question is, how the admo-
nitions of these great writers are to be recon-
ciled with what is undoubtedly to be found in
other parts of their works; and I think I do
mot go too far, when I say, that it ought to be
the inclination of every person’s mind who is
considering the meaning of any writer, par-
ticularly if he be a person of superior learning
and intelligence, to reconcile as much as _pos-
sible aj] he says upon any subject, and not to
adopt such.a construction as necessarily raises
up one part in direct opposition to another.

- The law itself, indeed, adopts this sound
tule of judgment in the examination of every
matter which is laid before it, fora sound con-
struction; and the judges, therefore are
bound by duty as well as reason to adopt it.

It apears to me, ‘hen, that the only ambi-
guity which arises, or can possibly arise, in
the examination of the great authorities, and
in the comparison of them with themselves,
or with one another, is, from not rightly un-
derstanding the meaning of the term overt
ACT as applied to this species of treason. The
moment ae get right upon the true meanin
and signification of this expression, the curtain
is drawn up, and all is light and certainty.

Gentlemen, an overt act of the high treason
charged upon this record, I take, with great
submission to the Court, to he plainly and
simply this :—the high treason charged, is the
compassing or imagining (in other words, the
intending or designing) the death of the king ;
I mean his waturat peat; which being a
hidden operation of the mind, an overt act is
any thing which legally proves the existenoe
of such traitorous design and intention—I say
that the design against the king’s natural life,
is the high treason under the first branch of
the statute; and whatever is evidence, which
may be legally laid before a jury to judge of
the traitorous intention, is a legal overt act ;
because an overt act is nothing but legal evi-
dence embodied upon the record.

The charge of compassing being a charge
of intention, which, without a manifestation
by conduct, no human tribunal could try; the
statute requires by its very letter (but without

‘which letter reason must have presumed)

that the intention to cut off the sovereign
should be manifested Hh an open act; and as
a prisoner charged with an intention, could
have no notice how to defend himself without
the charge of actions from whence the inten-
tion was to be imputed to him, it was always
the practice, according to the sound principles
of English law, to state upon the face of the
indictment the overt act, which the crown
charges as the means made use of by the
prisoner to effect his traitorous purpose ; and
as this rule was too frequently departed from,
the statute of the seventh of king William
enacted, for the benefit of the prisoner, that
no evidence should even be given of any overt
act not charged in the indictment. The
charge, therefore, of the overt acts in the in-
dictment is the notice, enacted by statute to
be given to the prisoner for his protection, of
the means by which the crown is to sub-
mit to the jury the existence of the traitor-
ous purpose, which is the crime alleged against
him, and in pursuance of which traitorous
purpose the overt acts must also be charged
to have been committed.—Whatever, there-
fore, is relevant or competent evidence to be
received in support of the traitorous intention
is a legal overt act, and what acts are compe-
tent to that purpose, is (as in all other cases
matter of law for the judges; but whether, —


.after the overt acts are received upon the re- |

cord as competent, and are established by
proof upon the trial, they be sufficient or in- '
sufficient in the particular instance, to con-
vince the jury of the traitorous compassing or
intention, isa mere matter of Fact, which,
from its very nature, can be reduced to no
other standard than that which each man’s
owa conscience and understanding erects in
his mind, as the arbiter of his judgment.—
This doctrine is by no means new nor peculiar
to high treason, but pervades the whole law,
and may be well illustrated in a memorable
case lately decided upon writ of error in the
House of Lords, and which must be in the
memory of all the jude now present, who
took a part in its decision—There the
question was, whether, upon the establish-
ment of a number of facts by legal evidence,
the defendant had knowledge of a fact,
the knowing of which would leave him
defenceless—To draw that question from
the jury to the judges, I demurred to the |
evidence, saying, that though each part of it |
was legally admitted, it was for the law, by
the mouth of the judges, to pronounce whe-
ther this fact of knowledge could legally be
inferred from it; but the Tords, with the as-
sentof all the judges, decided, to my perfect
satisfaction, that such a demurrer to the evi-
dence was irregular and invalid ; that the pro-
vince of the jury over the effect of evidence,
ought not to be so transferred to the judges,
and converted into matter of law ;—that what
was relevant evidence to come before a jury,
was the province of the Court,—but that the
conclusion to be drawn from admissible evi-
dence, was the unalienable province of the
country.

To apply that reasoning to the case before
us:—The matter to be inquired of here is, the
fact of the prisoner’s intention, as in the case
I have just cited it was the fact of the defen-
dant's knowledge.—The charge ofaconspiracy
to depose the ‘king, is therefore laid before
you to establish that intention ; its compe-
tency to be laid before you for that purpose,
is not disputed; I am only contending with
all reason and authority on my side, that it is
to be submitted to your consciences and un-
derstandings, whether, even if you believed the
overt act, you believe also that it proceeded
from a traitorous machination against the life
of the king.—I am only contending that these
two beliets must coincide to establish a verdict
of guilty.—I am not contending, that, under
circumstances, a conspiracy to depose the kiug,
and to annihilate his regal capacity, may not
be strong and satisfactory evidence of the in-
tention to destroy his r1¥z;—but only that in
this, as in every other instance, it is for you
to collect or not to collect this treason against
the king’s life, according to the result of your
sonscientious belief and judgment, from the
acts of the prisoner laid before you; and that
the establishment of the overt act, even if it
were established, does nut establish the trea-


son against the king’s life, By a consrevexce
or Law: but on the contrary, the overt act,
though punishable in another shape, as an
independent crime, is 4 dead letter upon this
record, unless you believe, exercising your ex-
clusive jurisdiction over the facts laid before you
that it was committed in accomplishment of
the treason against THE NATURAL LIFE OF TaL
Kine.

Gentlemen, this particular crime of com-
passing the king’s death, is so complete an
anomaly, being wholly seated in unconsum-
mated intention, that the law cannot depart
from describing it according to its real es
sence, even when it is followed by his death:
—a man cannot be indicted for kiliing the
king, as was settled in the case of the resi-
cides of Charles ist, after long consultation
among all the judges :—it was held that tie
very words of the stutute must be pursued, and
that although the king was actually mu-
dered, the prisoners who destroyed him could
not be charged with the act itself, as hich
treason, but with the compassing of his
death; the very act of the exccutioner m
beheading him, being only laid as the over
act upon the record.—There, though tne
overt act was so connected with, as to becren
inseparable from the traitorous intention, yet
they were not contounded, because of the
effect of the precedent in dissimilar cases:
and although the regicides came to be tried
immediately on the restoration of the king.
in the day-spring of his authority, and before
high prerogative judges, and under circum-
stances when, in any country but Englsnd,
their trial would have been a mockery, «
their execution have becn awarded withoot
even the forms of trial; yet in England, thst
sacred liberty, which has for ever adorned the
constitution, refused to sacrifice to zeal or et
thusiasm, cither the substance or the forms
of justice, Hear what the chicf baron pr-
Nounced upon that occasion :— These po-
sons are to be proceeded with according to the
laws of the land, and I shull speak wothing 0
you but what are THE worns of the law. Bi
the statute of Edward 3rd, it is made high
treason to compass and imagine the death
the king ; in no case else, imagination or com
passing, without an actual effect, is punishable
K4 law.” He then speaks of the sacred life o!
the king, and speaking of the treason, 9/5!
— The treason consists in the wicked imetr
nation which is not apparent ; but when this
poison swells out of the heart, and breaks forth
into action, in that case tt is high tres.
THEN WHAT IS AN OVERT ACT OF AN 1MAGIS‘-
TION, OR COMPASSING OF THE K1No’s DBATH-
TRULY, IT IS ANY THING WHICH SHOWS WAIT
THE IMAGINATION OF THE HEART I5.”°

Indeed, gentlemen, the proposition is ©
clear, that one gets confounded in the #rzv-
ment from the very simplicity of it; but stl !
stand in a situation which I am determined #!



all events to fulfil to the utmost; and I shall
therefore not leave the matter upon these au-
thorities, but will bring it down to our own
times, repeating my challenge to have pro-
duced one single authority m contradiction
Lord Coke, in his third Institute, page 11, and
12, says :—* The indictment must charge that
the prisoner traitorously compussed and ima-
gined the death and destruction of the king.”
He says too,— There must be a compassing
or imagination ; for an act without compassing,
intent, or imagination, ts not within the act, as
appeareth by the express letter thereof. Et
actus non faci reum nisi mens sit rea.” No-
thing in language can more clearly illustrate
my proposition.—-The indictment, like every
ibe indictment, must charge distinctly and
specifically the crime: that charge must there-
fore be in the very words of the statute which
creates crime; the crime created by the
statute not being the perpetration of any act,
but being, in the rigorous severity of the law,
the very contemplation, intention, and con-
trivance of a purpose directed to an act: that
contemplation, purpose, and contrivance,
must be found to exist, without which, says
lord Coke, there can be no compassing : and
as the intention of the mind cannot be inves-
tigated without the investigation of conduct,
the overt act is required by the statute, and
must be laid in the indictment and proved.—
It follows from this deduction, that upon the
clear principles of the English law, every act
may be laid as an overt act of compassing the
king’s death, which may be reasonably consi-
dered to be relevant and competent to mani-
fest that intention; for, were rt otherwise, it
would be shutting out from the view of the
jury, certain conduct of the prisoner, which
might, according to circumstances, lead to
manifest the criminal intention of his mind;
and as more than one overt act may be laid,
and even overt acts of different kinds, though
not in themselves substantively treason, the
judges aj to be justified in law, when
they ruled them ¢o be overt acts of compass-
ing the death of the king; because they are
such acts as before the statute of king William
which required that the indictment should
charge all overt acts, would have been held
to be relevant proof; of which relevancy of
Bang the poilees ate to judge as matter of
tw’; and therefore being relevant proof, must
also be relevant matter of charge, because
nothing can be relevantly charged which may
not also he relevantly admitted to proof.
These observations explain to the meanest
capacity,’ in what sense lord Coke must be
understood, when he says, in the very same
page, that, “ 4 preparation to depose the king,
and to take the king by force and strong hand,
wntil he has yielded to certain demands, is a
preg overt act to PRovE the compassing of
the king’s death.” He does not say as a PRO-
Pesrrion oF Law, that he who prepares to
seize the king, compasseth his death, but that
# preparation to seize him is a sufficient overt


act to Prove the compassing; and he directly
gives the reason, “because of the strong,
tendency it has to that end.” This latter
sentence destroys all ambiguity.—I agree per-
pa with lord Coke, and I think every judge.
would so decide, upon the general principles
of law and evidence, without any resort to.
his authority for it; and for this plain and
obvious reason :—The judges who are by law
to decide upon the relevancy or competency |
of the proof, in every matter criminal, an
civil, have immemorially sanctioned the indis-
pensable necessity of charging the traitorous,
intention as the crime, before it was required
by the statute of king William.—As the crime
is in its nature invisible and inscrutable, not
manifested by such conduct as in the eve o!
reason is indicative of the intention, which’
constitutes the crime; no overt act is there-,
fore held to be sufficient to give jurisdiction,
even to a jury to draw the inference in fact,
of the traitorous purpose, but such acts from,
whence it may be reasonably inferred; and.
therefore as the restraint and imprisonment,
of a prince has a greater tendency to his de-,
struction than in the case of a private man,,
such conspiracies are admitted to be laid ag
ovett acts, upon this principle, that ifa man
does air act front whence either an inevitable
or a mainly probable consequence may be ex+
pected to follow, much more if he persists
deliberately in a course of conduct, leading
certainly or probably to any given conse+
uence, it is reasonable to believe that he
foresaw such consequence, and by pursuing
his purpose with that foreknowledge, the in-
tention to produce the consequence may be.
fairly imputed— But then all this is matter of
Sact for the jury from the evidence, NOT MATTER
OF Law For THE Court; farther than it is the
privilege and duty of the judge to direct the
attention of the jury to the evidence, and tg
state the law as it may result from the dif
ferent views the jury may entertain of the
facts; and if such acts could not be laid ag
overt acts, they could not be offered in evi-
dence; and if they could not be offered ip
evidence, the mind of the prisoner, which it
was the object of the trial to lay open 99 @
elue to his intention, would be shut up and
concealed from the jury, whenever the death
of the sovereign was sought by circuitous but
obvious means, instead of by a direct and
murderous machination.— But when they are
thus submitted, as matter of charge and evi-
dence to prove the traitorous purpose which
is the erime, the security of the king and
the subject is equally provided for: all the
matter which has a relevancy to the crime, ig
chargeable and proveable, not substantively to
raise from their establishment a /egaé infer-
ence, but to raise a presumption in fact, capa-
ble of being weighed by the jury with alt
the circumstances of the transaction, ag
offered by the Crown and the Prisoner; their
province being finally to say---not what was
the possible or the probable consequence of
3M

the overt act laid in the Indictment, but whe-
ther it has brought them to a safe and con-
scientious judgment of the guilt of the Pri-
soner; i. e. of his guilt in compassing the
death of the king, which is the treason
charged in the Indictment. Lord Hale is, if
possible, more direct and explicit upon the
subject.-He says, page 107, “ The words
compass or imagine, ure of a great latitude ;
they refcr to the purpose or design of the MIND
oR wILt, though the purpose or design takes
not effect: but compassing or imagining, singly
of itself, is an INTERN aL act, and, without some-
thing to mantrest it, could not possibly fall
under any judicial cognizance but of God
alone; and therefore this statute requires such
AW OVERT acT as may render the compassing or
imagining capable of a trial and sentence by
Auman jidicatures.” Now can any nan pos-
sibly derive from such a writing (proceedin|
too from an author of the character of Lor
Hale), that an overt act of compassing, might
in his judgment be an act committed inad-
vertently without the intention? Can any
man gather from it, that a man, by falling
into bad company, can be drawn in to be
ilty of this species of treason by rash con-
fier while the love of his Sovereign was
glowing in his bosom?—Can there any
Particular acts which can entitle a Judge or
unsel to pronounce as a matter of law, what
another man intends? or that what man in-
tends is not a matter of fact? Is there any
man that will meet the matter fairly, and
advance and support that naked proposition ?
At all events, it is certainly not a proposi-
tion to be dealt with publicly ; because the
man whose mind is capable even of conceiv-
ing it, should be treasured up in a museum,
and exhibited there as a curiosity, fur money.
* Gentlemen, all I am asking, however, from
my argument (and I defy any power of reason
upon earth to move me from it), is this: that
the Prisoner being charged with intending the
King’s death, you are to find whether this
charge be founded or unfounded: and that
therefore, put upon the record what else you
will,—prove what you will,—read these books
over and over again,—and let us stand here a
year and a day in discoursing concerning them,
—still the question must return at last to what
you and you on.y can resolve—Is he guilty of
that base detestable intention to destroy the
King? Nort whether you incline to believe
that he is guilty; nor whether you suspect,
nor whether it be probable ; xor whether he
may be Guitty ;—no, but that pRoveaBLy
HE Is Gurity. If you can say this upon the
evidence, it is your duty to say 0, and you
may, with a tranquil conscience, return to
your families ; though by yonr judgment the
‘unhappy object of it must return no more to
his.—Alas! Gentlemen, what doI say? us

partner of his life has already fallen a victim
to the surprise and horror which atteuded the
scene now transacting—But let that melan-

choly reflexion pass—it should not, perhaps,
have been introduced—it certainly ought to
have no effect upon you who are to judge upon,
your oaths.—I do not stand here to desire you
to commit perjury from compassion ;—but at
the same time my earnestness may. be for-
given, since it proceeds from a weakness com~
mon to us all. I clain:no merit with the Pri-
soner for my zeal ;—it proceeds from a selfish
principle inherent in the human heart—I am
Counsel, Gentlemen, for myself. In ev
word I utter, I feel-that I am pleading for the
safety of my own life, for the lives of my
children atter me, for the happiness of my
country, and for the universal condition of
civil society throughoyt the world.

But let us return to the subject, and pursue
the doctrine of lord Hale upon the true inter-
pretation of the term overt act, as applicable to
this branch of treason. Lord Hale says,. and
I do beseech most. earnestly the attention of
the Court and Jury to this passage—“ If men
conspire the death of the king,.and thereupon
provide weapons, or send letters,. this is an
overt act within the statute.’ Take this to
picces, and what does it amount to?—* If
men conspire the death of the king,” that
is the first thing, viz. the intention, “ and
thereupon,” that is, in pursuance of that
wicked intention “ provide weapons, or send
letters for the execution thereof,” i. e. for the
execution of that destruction of the Ki
which they have meditated, “ this is anovert
act within the statute.” Surely the meaning
of all this is self evident.—If the intention be
against the king’s life, though the{conspiracy
does not immediately and direc! int to
his death, yet still the overt act will te sufh-
cient if it be something which has so direct a
tendency to that end, as to be competent
rational evidence of the intention to obtain it.
But the instances given by Lord Hale him-
self furnish the best illustration—‘ If mes.
conspire to imprison the King by Force anp
A STRONG HAND, until he has yielded to certain
demands, and FOR THAT PURPOSE GATHER COM-
PANY OR WRITE LETTERS, that ts an overt act
TO PROVE the compassing the King’s death, as
it was held in lord Cobham’s case by oll the
Judges.” In this sentence lord Hale does
not depart from that precision which sa emi-
nently distinguishes all his writings; he does
not say that if men conspire to imprison the
king until he yields to certain demands, and
for that purpose to do so and so, This is high
Treason—no, nor even an overt act of high
treason, though he might in legal
correctly have said so; but to prevent
possibility of coufounding the treason with
matter which may be legally charged as rele-
vant to the proof of it, he follows lord Coke’s
expression in the third Institute, and says,
This is an overt act to prove the compassing.
of the king’s death :and as if by this mode
expression he had not done enough to
the ideas asunder, and from ab it
for the rights aud liberties of the subject, he

immediately adds, “ But then there must be an
overt.act 10 PROVE that conspiracy; and then
that overt act to PROVE such design, is an overt
act To PRovE the compassing of the death of
the king.” The language of this sentence
labours in the ear from the excessive caution
of the writer ;—afraid that his reader should
jump ‘oo fast to his conclusion upona subject
of such awful moment, he pulls him back, after
he has read that a conspiracy to imprison the
ine is an overt act to prove the compassing
of his death, and says to him, but recollect
that there must be an overt act to Prove, in
the first Place, that conspiracy to imprison the
king, and even then that intention to imprison
him so manifested by the overt act, is but in its
turn an overt act to prove the compassing or
intentiun to destroy the king.—Nor does the
great and benevolent Hale rest even here, but
after this almost tedious perspicuity, he be-
gins the next sentence with this fresh caution
and limitation, “ But then this must be intend-
ed of a conspiracy ForciBLY to detain end im-
prison the king.” What then is a conspiracy

lorcibly to imrprison the king ?—surely it can
require no explanation: it can only be a direct
machination to seize and detain his person
by rebellious torce.—Will this expression be
satisfied by a conspiracy to seize speculatively
upon his authority by the publication of pum-
phlets, which, by the inculcation of republican
principles, may in the eventual circulation of
a course of years, perhaps in a course of cen-
turies, in this king's time, or in the time of a
remote successor, dehauch men’s minds from
the English constitution, and, by the destruc-
tivn of monarchy, involve the life of the mo-
narch P—Will any man say that this is what
the law means by a conspiracy against the
King’s government, supposing even that a
conspiracy against his government were sy-
nonimous with a design upon his life? Can
any case be produced where a person has been
found guilty of high treason under this branch
of the statute, where no war has been actually
levied, unless where the conspiracy has been
a forcible invasion of the king’s personal li-
berty or security? { do not mean to say that
conspiracy to levy war may not, in many
instances, be laid as an overt act of compass-
ing the king’s death, because the war may be
medittely or immediately pointed distinctly
to his destruction or captivity ; and as lord
Hale truly says, “small is the distance be-
tween the prisons and graves of Princes.”—
But multiply the instances as you will, still
the principle presents itself-—The truth of
this very maxim, built upon experience, ren-
ders an overt act of this description rational
and competent evidence to be left to a jury of
a design against the king’s life; but it does
not, therefore, change the nature of the crime,
nor warrant any court to declare the overt act
to be legally and conclusively indicative of the
traitorous intention; because, if this be once
admitted to be law, and-the jury are bound to
find: the-treason upon their belicf of the ex-


istence of the overt act, the trial by the coyn-
try is atan end, and the judges are armed with
an arbitrary uncontrollable dominion over
the lives and liberties of the nation. .
Gentlemen, I will now proceed to show
‘ou that the doctrines which I am insisting on
ave been held by all the great judges of this
country, in even the worst of times, and that
they are, besides, not at all peculiar to the
case of high treason, but pervade the whole
system of the criminal law. Mr. Justice Fos-
ter, so justly celebrated for his writings, lays
down the rule thus :—It may be laid down as
a general rule, that “ indictments founded
UPON PENAL sTaTUTES, ESPECIALLY THE
MOST PENAL, must pursue the statute so as
to bring the party within tt.” ~And this gene-
ral rule is so expressly allowed to have place
in high treason, that it is admitted on all
hands, that an irdictment would be radically
and incurably bad, unless it charged the com-
passing of the king’s death, as the leading and
fundamental averment, and unless it formally
charged the overt act to be committed in order
to effectuate the traitorous purpose. Nobody
ever denied this proposition ; and the present
indictment is framed accordingly. Now it is
needless to say that if the benignity of the
general law requires this precision in the in-
dictment, the proof must be correspondingly
precise, for otherwise the subject would te
rive no benefit from the strictness of the in-
dictment; the strictness of whichcan have no
other meaning in law or common sense, than
the protection af the prisoner ; for if, though
the indictment must directly charge a breach
of the very Letter of the statute, the prisoner
could, nevertheless, be convicted by evidence
not amounting to a breach of the Lerren, then
the strictness of the indictment would not
only be no protection to the prisoner, but a
direct violation of the first principles of jus-
tice criminal and civil, which call universally
for the proof of all material averments in
every legal proceeding.~--But Mr. Justice Fos-
ter expressly adverts to the necessary severity
of proof, as well as of charge—for he says,
that “although a case is brought within the
reason of 2 penal statute, and within the mis-
chief to be prevented, yet, if it does not come
within the unequivocal etter, the benignity
of the law interposeth.” If the law then be
thus severe in the interpretation of every pe-
nal proceeding, even down to an action for
the itay of a hare or a partridge, are its
constructions only to be enlarged and extend-
ed as to the statute of high treason, athough
the single object of passing it was tu guard
inst constructions? ;

Gentlemen, the reason of the thing is so
pably and invincibly in favour of this ana-
logy, that it never met with a direct opposi-
tion. The attorney-general himself distinctly
admits it in one part of his address to you,
though he seems to deny it in another.—I
hope that when I state one part of his speech
to be in diametrical opposition to another, he


wyill not suppose that I attribute the inconsis-
fency to any defect, either in his understand-
ing or his heart ; far from it—it arises, I ayn
Convinced, from some of the authorities not
being sufficiently understood. : .
In the beginning of his speech he admits
that the evidence must be satisfactory and
convincing asto the intention; but in the lat-
ter part he seems, as it were, to take off the
effect of that admission. I wish to give you
the very words. I took them down at'the
ime; and ifI do not state them correctly,
f desire to be corrected. “I most dis+
tinctly disavow,” said my honourable friend,
“ every case of construgtion. I most dis-
tinctly disavow any like case of treason not
within the letter of the statute. I most dis-
tinctly disavow cumulative treason. I most
distinctly disavow enhancing guilt by parity
of reason. The question umdubeedly is, whe-
ther the proof be full and satisfactory to your
Teasons and consciences that the prisoner is
ilty of the treason of compassing the king’s
leath.” Gentlemen, J hope that this will al-
ways with equal honour be admitted. Now
Tet us see how the rest of the learned gentle.
man’s speech falls in with this—For he goes
on to say, that it is by no means necessary that
the distinct, specific intention should pre-
exist the overt act. “If the overt act,” says
he, “be deliberately committed, it isa com-
passing.” But how so, if the intention be ad-
titted to be the treason ¥ What benefit is ob-
tained by the rigorous demand of the statute,

that the compassing of the king’s death shall |.

be charged by the indictment as the crime
if a crime different, or short of it, can be sub-
Stituted for it in the proof: and how can the sta-
tute cf itichard and be said to be repealed,which
made it Ligh treason to compass to depose the
king, independently of intention upon his life,
if the law shall declare, notwithstanding the
repeal, that they are synonimous terms, and
that the one conciustvery involves the other?
Gentlemen, if we examine the most promi-
pent cases, which have geome in judgment be-
fore judges of the most unquestionable autha-
nity and after the constitution had become
fixed, you will find every thing that I have
been saying to you justitied and confirmed.
The first great Stite rial, after the revolu-
tion, was the case of sir John breind,* acon-
gpirator in the assassination plot. Sir John
Freind was indi¢ted for compassing and ima-
gining the death of i

ere, first, the sending Mr. Charnock into
Prue to king James,

suade the French king to send forces over to
Great Britain, to levy i


Freind was to:be colonel.—In this case, if the
proofs were not to be wholly discredited, and
the overt acts were c uently established,
they went rationally to convince tbe mind of
every man of the fre esisting intention tp
destroy the king.—The conspiracy was not to
do an act which, though it might lead eves.
tually and speculatively to the xin death,
might not be forescen or designed by thos
who conspired together :—the conspiracy was
not directed to an event, probably leading to
another, and a different one, and from th
happening of which second, a third still diffe.
rent might be engendered, which third might
again lead in its consequences to a fourth slate
of things, which might, in the revolution of
events, bring on the death of the king,
though never assed ar imagined :—Freind’s
conspiracy, en the contrary, for its direct
and immediate object the restoration of the
Pretender to the throne, by the junction of
foreign and rebellious force. In my opinion
(and I am not more disposed than others to
push things beyond their mark in the adni-
nistration of criminal justice), sir John Freind,
if the evidence against him found credit with
the jury, could have no possible defence;
since the evidence went directly to prove the
despatch of Charnock to France, under hi
direction, to invite the French kin to bring
ever the Pretender into England, | to place
him on the throne,—The intention, therefore,
of sir John Freind to cut off king Willian,
was a clear inference from the overt actia
luestion; not an inference of daw for ue
ourt, but of fact for the jury, under the
guidance of plain common sense; because the
Consequence of the Pretender's r: ng the
throne must have been, the attainder o z
William by act of parliament.—Some gentle-
men seem to look as if they thought sot—but
I should be glad to hear the positian contra
dicted.—I repeat, that if the Pretender had
been restored, as king of England, the legal
consequence would have been, that king
William would baye been a traitor and a
usurper, and subject as sych to be tried at the
Old Bailey, or wherever else the ki _ who
fouk his place, thought fit to wig 4 bo
Jjudgment.—From these premises, erefore,
there could be go difficulty of inferring the
intention; and, therefore, if ever a case ex!
where, from the clearness of the inference,
the province of the jury might have been
overlooked, and the overt act confounded with
the treason, it was in the instance of Freind;
but so far was this from being the case, thet
ou will find, on the contrary, every thing I
lave been saying to you, since I began #
address you, summed up and confirmed by
that most eminent istrate lord,
justice Holt, who presided dipen that trial.
He hegins thus :—“ Gentiemen of the jury
look ye, the ireuson that 1 mentioned im tht
indictinent is conspiring, cumpassing, ond ime
Bining the death of the king. To Prove TH
CONAPIRACY AND DESIGN of she King’s DEATH,

taco principal overt acts are insisted on.” He
does not consider the overt act of conspiracy
and consultation to bethe treason, but evidence
(as it undoubtedly was in that case) to prove
the compassing thedeath. ‘The chief justice
then states the two overt acts above men-
tioned, and sums up the evidence for and
against the prisoner, and leaves the intention
to the jury as matter of fuct.—For it is not till
atterwards that he comes to answer the pri-
soner's objection in point of law, as the chief
justice in terme puts it—“ there is another
thing,” said lord chief justice Holt, “ he did
insist upon, AND THAT 18 MATTER OF Law.
The statute 25th Edward III. was read, which
is the great statute about treasons, and that does
contain divers species of treason, and declares
what shall be treason: one treason is the com-
‘passing and imagining the death of the king ;
another is the levying war. Now says he” (i. e.
Freinp), “here is no war actually levied ;
and a bare conspiracy to levy war, does not
come within the law against treason.” To
pause here a little: Freind’s argument was
this—whatever my iatentions might
whatever my object of levying war might
shave been—whatever might have been my
design to levy it—however the destruction of
athe king might have been effected by my
conspiracy, if it had gone on—and however it
might have been my intention that it should,
—it is not treason within the 25th of Edward
III.—To which Holt replied, a little incor-
rectly in language, but right in substance—
“© Now for that I must tell you, if there be only
a conspiracy to levy war, it is Not treason ;” i. e.
it is not a substantive treason: it is not a
treason in the abstract. “ But if the design
and conspiracy be either to kill the king, or to
depose him, or imprison him, or put any force or
restraint upon him,” i. e. personal restraint by
force, “and the way of ehecting these purposes
1S BY LEVYING A waR; there the conspirucy
and consultation, to leoy war for that purpose,
is high treason, though no war be levied: for
such consultation and conspiracy is AN OVERT
aur PROVING the compassing the death of the
ing.”
conspiracy to levy which, is an overt act to
prove a design against the king’s life, though
no war be actually levied? Gentlemen, lord
Holt himself illustrates this matter so clearly,
that if I bad any thing at stake short of the
honour and lite of the prisoner, I might sit
down as soon as I had read it :—for if one did
not know it to be an extract from an ancient
trial, one wouid say it was admirably and ac-
curately written for the present purpose.—It
is a sort of prophetic bird’s eye view of what
we are engaged in at this moment :-—“ there
y be war levied (continues lord Holt in
Freind’s case) without any design upon the
a pA nll ery pf ARaVAREN SEYEED is

But what sort of war is it, the bare |

OF IT 1s Not so. So when they endeavour, m
great numbers, witH FoRcE, tomake reformation
of their own heads, without pursuing the methods
of the law, that is a leoying war, BUT THE PUB-
POSE AND DESIGNING iS NoT 80. But if there
be, as I told you, a purpose and design To pES-
Troy THE Kino, aNnb” (not or to depose him,
but and to depose him) “ to depose him from his
throne, which is proposed and designed to be
effected by war thut is to be levied ; such a con-
spiracy and consultation to levy war FoR THE
BRINGING THIS TO Pass” (i. e. for bringing the
king’s death to pass) “ ts an overt act of high
treason. So that, gentlemen, as to that objection
which he makes, IN POINT OF LAW, it ts of
no force, if there be evidence sufficient to con-
vince you that he did conspire to levy war FOR
SUCH AN END.” And he concludes by
again leaving the intention expressly to the

Itis rue END THEREFORE FOR WHIcH the war
is to be levied, and not the conspiracy to do
any act which the law considers as a levying
of war, that constitutes an overt act uf treason
against the king's life.---The most rebellious
movements towards a reform in goverument,
not directed against the king’s person, will not,
according to lord Holt, support the charge
before you.—I might surround the House of
Commons with fifty thousand men, for the ex-
press purpose of forcing them, by duress, to
repeal any law that is oifensive to me, or to
pass a bill for altering elections, without being
a possible object of this prosecution.---Under
the other branch of the statute, I might indeed
be convicted of levying war, but not of com-
passing the king’s death; and if I only con-
spired and meditated this rising to repeal laws
by rebellion, I could be convicted of nothing
but a high misdemeanor.---I would give my
friends the case upon a special verdict, and
let them hang me if they could.—-How much
more might I give it them if the conspiracy
imputed was not to effect a reform by violence,
but, as in the case before us, by pamphlets
and speeches, which might produce universal
suffrage, which universal aucune might eat
out and destroy aristocracy, which destruction
might lead to the fall of monarchy, and, in
the end, to the death of the king.---Gentle-
men, if the cause were not too serious, I
should liken it to the play with which we
amuse our children. “ This is the cow with
the crumpledy horn, which gored the dog,
that worried the cat, that ate the rat,” &c.
ending in the “ house which Jack built.”
Ido therefore maintain, upon the express
authority of lord Holt, that, to convict a pri-
soner, charged with this treason, it is abso-
lutely necessary that you should be satisfied
of his intention against the king's life, as
charged in the indictment, and that no design
against the king’s government will even bea
Jegal overt act to be left to a jury as the evi-
dence of such am intention (much less the

substantive and consummate treason), unless
the conspiracy be directly pointed against the
person of the king. The case of lord George
Gordon® is opposed to this as a high and mo-
dern decision; and the attorney gencral des-
cended indeed to a very humble and lowly
authority, when he sought to maintain his
argument by my own specch, as counsel for
that unfortunate person. The passage of it
alluded to lies at this moment before me;
and I shall repeat it, and re-maintain it to-
day.—But let it first be recollected, that lord
George Gordon was not indicted for com-
passing or imagining the king’s death, under
the first branch of the statute, but for levying
war under the second. It never indecd en-
tered into the conception of any man living,
that such an indictment could have been
maintained, or attempted against him: I ap-
peal to one of your lordships now present, for
whose learning and capacity I have the great-
est and highest respect, and who sat upon
that trial, that it was not insinuated from the
bar, much less adjudged by the Court, that
the evidence had any bearing upon the first
branch of treason.—I know that I may safely
appeal to Mr. Justice Buller for the truth of
this assertion; and nothing surely in the pas-
sage from my address to the jury, has the re-
motest allusion to assimilate a conspiracy
against the king’s government (collateral to

. his person) with a treason against his life—
My words were, “ To compass or imagine the
death of the king ; such imagination, or pur-
pose of the mind, visible only to its great Au-
thor, being manifested by some open act ; an
institution obviously directed, not only to the
security of his natural person, but to the sta-
bility of the government; the lite of the
prince being so interwoven with the constitu-
tion of the state, that an stent to destroy
the one, is justly held to be a rebellious con-
Spiracy against the other.”+

What is this but to say that the king’s sacred
life is guarded by higher sanctions than the
ordinary laws, because of its more inseparable
connexion with the public security, and that
an atlempt to destroy it is therefore made
treason against the state? But the attorney
general is, I am sure, too correct in his logic
to say, . that the converse of the proposition is
therefore maintained, and that an attack upon
the king’s authority, without design upon his

rson, is affirmed by the same expression to

treason against his lite——His correct and
enlarged mind is incapable of such confusion
of ideas.

But it is time to quit what fell from me upon
this occasion, in order to examine the ; ie-
ment of the Court; and to clothe mysel with
the authority of that great and venerable ma-
gistrate, whose memory will always be dear
to me, not only from the eminent services he


7


rendered to his country in the administration
of her justice, but on account of the personal
peed and reverence I had for him wheo
iving.

Lord Mansfield, in delivering the law to
the jury upon lord George lon’s trial (I
areal to the trial itself, and to Mr. Justice
Buller, now present, who agreed in the judg-
ment), expressly distinguished between the
safety provided for the king’s natural persoz,
by the first branch of the statute, and the se-
curity of his executive power under tbe se-
cond. That great judge never had an idea
that the natural person of the king, and the
majesty of the king, were the same thing, nor
that the treasons against them were syponi-
mous: he knew, on the contrary, for he knew
all that was to be known, that as_ substantive
crimes they never had been blended. I will
read his own words :—“ There are two kinds
of levying war:—one against the person of
the king: to imprison, to dethrone, or to kil
him ; or to make him change measures, of
Temove counsellors :—the other, which issaid
to be levied against the majesty of the king,
or, in other words, against him in his regal
capacity: as when a muttitude rise and as-
semble to attain by force and violence apy
object of a general public nature; that 1
levying war against the majesty of the king;
aud inost reasonably so held, because it
to dissolve all the bonds of society, to dest
prepay and to overturn government;

yy force of atlas, to restrain the king from
reigning according to law.”* But then ob-
serve, gentlemen, the war must be actuelly
levied ; and here again I appeal to Mr. Jus-
tice Buller, for the words of lord Mansfield,
expressly referring for what he said to the
authority of Jord Holt, in sir John Freind’s
case, already cited: “ Lord chief justice Holt, in
sir John Freind’s case, says :—* If persons do
‘assemble themselves and act with force, in
‘ opposition to some law which they think in-
‘convenient, and hope thereby to get it re
‘pealed, this is a levying war and treason.’
In the present caset it does not rest upon a0
implication that they hoped by opposition to
a law to get it repealed; but the prosecution
proceeds upon the direct ground, that the ob-
ject was, by force and violence, to com
legislature to repeal alaw; and _therefo
without any doubt, I tell you the joint opinion
of us all, that, if this multitude assembled,
with intent by acts of force and violence, t0
compel the legislature to repeal a law, it 1s
high treason.” Let these words of
Mansfield be taken down, and then show me
the man, let his rank and capacity be
they may, who can remove me from the foun
dation on which I stand, when I maintain
lien ecm


+ Lord George Gordon's, then on trial.


that a conspiracy to levy war for the objects
of reformation, is not only not the high trea-
son charged by this indictment, when not di-
rectly pointed against the king’s person, but
that even the actual: levying it would not
amount to the constitution of the crime. But
this is the least material part of lord Mans-
field's judgment, as applicable to the present
question ; for he expressly considers THE 1N-
TextTIon of the prisoner, whatever be the act
of treason alleged against him, to be all in all.
—So far from holding the probable or even
inevitable consequence of the thing done as
constituting the quality of the act, he pie:
nounces them to be nothing as separated from
the criminal-design to produce them.—Lord
George Gordon assembled an immense mul-
titude around the House of Commons, a sys-
tem so opposite to that of the persons accused
before this commission, that it appears from
the evidence they would not even allow a
man to come amongst them, because he had
been lord George's attorney.—The Lords and
Commons were absolutely blockaded in the
chambers of Parliament; and if control was
the intention of the prisoner, it must be
wholly immaterial what were the deliberations
that were to be controlled ; whether it was
the continuance of Roman Catholics under pe-
nal laws, the repeal of the septennial act, or
a total change of the structure of the House of |
Commons, that was the object of violence,—
the attack upon the legislature of the coun-
try would have been the same. That the
tultitude were actually assembled round the
Houses, and brought there by the prisoner, it
‘was impossible for me as his counsel even to
think of denying, nor that their tumultuous ;
proceedings were not in effect productive of
great intimidation, and even danger, to the

rds and Commons, in the exercise of their
authority :—neither did I venture to question
the law, that the assembling the multitude
Sor that purpose, was levying war within the
gtatute.—Upon these facts, therefore, applied
to the doctrines we have heard upon this
trial, there would have been nothing in lord
George Gordon's case to try; he must have
been instantly without controversy, convicted.
But lord Mansfield did not say to the jury (ac-
cording to the doctrines that have been
broached here), that if they found the multi-
tude assembled by the prisoner, were in fact
palpably intimidating and controlling the
parliament in the exercise of their functions, he
was guilty of high treason, whatever his inten-
tions might have been.—Le did not tell them
that the inevitable consequence of assembling
a hundred thousand people round the legisla-
ture, being a control on their proceedings,
was Lhsrefors a levying war, though collected
from folly and rashness, without the intention
of violence or control.—If this had been the
doctrine of lord Mansfield, there would (as I
‘paid before) have been nothing to try; for I
admitted in terms, that his conduct was the
gxtremity of rashness, and totally inconsistent


with his rank in the country, and his station
asa member of the House of Commons.—
But the venerable magistrate never for a mo-
ment lost sight of the grand ruling principle
of criminal justice, that crimes can have no
seat but in the mind; and upon the pris ner’s
intention, and ypon his intention alone, he ex-
pressly left the whole matter to the jury, with
the following directions, which I shall read
verbatim from the trial :

“Having premised these several proposi-
tions. and principles, the subject matter for
your consideration naturally resolves itself
into two points :

“ First, Whether this multitude did assem-
ble and commit acts of violence, witn intent to
terrify and compel the legislature to repeal
the act called sirGeorge Savile’s.—If upon this
point your opinion should he in the negative,
that makes an end of the whole, and the pri-
soner ought to be acquitted ; but if your opi
nion should be, that the intent of this multi-
tude, and the violence they committed, was
to force a repeal, there arises a second point-

“ Whether the prisoner at the bar incited,
encouraged, promoted, or assisted in raisin;
this insurrection, and the terror they carri
with them, wiTH THE INTENT of forcing a
repeal of this law.

“ Upon these two points, which you will
call your attention to, depends the fate of this
trial; for if either the multitude had no such
intent, or supposing they had, if the prisoner
was no cause, did not excite, and took no part
in conducting, counselling, or fomenting the
insurrection, the prisoner ought to be-ac
quitted : and there is no pretence that he per-
sonally concurred in any act of violence.”*

1 therefore consider the case of lord G
Gordon, as a direct authority in my favour.

To show that a conspiracy to depose the
king, independently of ulterior intention
against his life, is high treason within the
statute, the attorney general next supposes
that traitors had conspired to depose king
William, but still to preserve him as stadt-
holder in Holland, and asks whether that con-
spiracy would not be a compassing his death:
to that question I answer, that it would not
have been a sunt ating the death of ine
William, provided the conspirators coul
have convinced the jury that their firm and
bond fide intention was, to proceed no farther,
and that, under that belief and impression,
the jury (as they lawfully might) had nega-
ead by their finding, the fact of the inten-
tion against the king’s natural existence.—I
have no doubt at all, that, eee that budling,
no judgment of treason could be pronounced :
but the difficulty would be, to meet with a
jury, who, upon the bare evidence of such a
conspiracy, would find such a verdict. There
might be possible cireumstances to justify
such a negative of the intention, but they


must come from the prisoner. -In that case
the Crown would rest upon the conspiracy to
depose, which would be primé facie and
cogent evidence of the compassing, and leave
the hard task of rebutting it, on the defend-
ants+—I say the hard task, because the case
put is ofa direct rebellious force, acting against
the king; not only abrogating his authority,
but‘imprisoning and expelling his person from
the kingdom. I am not seeking to abuse the
reasots and consciences of juries in the exa-
mination of facts, but am only resisting the
confounding them with arbitrary propositions
of law.

Gentlemen, I hope I have now a right to
consider that the existence of the high treason
charged against the unfortunate man before

, 18 @ matter of fact for your consideration
upon the evidence.—To establish this point,
has been the scope of all that you have been
listening to, with so much indulgence and
patience. It was my intention to have farther
supported myself, by a great many authori-
ties, which I have been Saborigusty extractin;
from the different books of the law; but
find I must pause here, lest I consume my
strength in this preliminary part of the case,
and leave the rest defective.

Gentlemen, the persons named in the in-

iment, are charged with a conspiracy to
subvert the rale, order, and government of
this country; and it is material that you
should observe most particularly the means
by which it alleges this purpose was to be ae-
complished.—The charge is not of a con
spiracy to hold the convention in Scotland,
which was actually held there; nor of the
part they took in its actual proceedings; but
the overt act, to which all the others are sab-
sidiary and subordinate, is, a supposed con-
piracy to hold a convention in England, which
never in fact was held; and consequently all
the vast load of matter which it has been de-
cided you should hear, that does not imme-
diately connect itself with the charge in ques-
tion, 1s ad laid mes you (as ~~ Court has
repeatedly expressed it) to prove that in point
of fact as nroceeding aes had, the ality
of which is for your j ent; and as far,
and as far only, 23 they can be connected with
the prisoner, and the act which be stands
charged with, to be left to you, as evidence of
the intention with which the holding of the
second convention was projected,

Turs rnrention is therefore the whole
cause—for the charge is notthe agreement to
hold a convention, which it is notorious, self
evident, and even admitted that they intended
to hold; but the agreement to hold it for the
purpose alleged, of assuming all the authority
the state, and in fulfilment of the main inten-
tion against the life of the king, Unless,
therefore, you can collect this double intention
from the evidence before you, the indietment
is not med.

Gentlemen, the charge being of a con-
spiracy, which, if made out in point of fact,

involved’ beyorid‘all controversy, and within
the certain knowledge of the conspirators, the
lives of every soul that was nee in it;
the first observation which I shall make to
you (hecause in reason it ought to ptecede all
others) is, that every act ore by the pr-
soners, and every sentence written by them,
in the remotest degree connected with the

‘charge, or offered in evidence to

it,
were done and written in the public face of
the world:—the transactions wirich const+
tute the whole body of the proof, were not
those of a day, but in regular series for tro
years together; they were not the peculiar
transaction of the prisoners, but of immense
bodies of the king’s subjects, in various
of the kingdom, assembled without the
smallest reserve, and giving to the public,
through the channel of the daily newspapers
a minute and regular journal of their whole
proceedings. Not a syllable have we heard
read, in the week’s imprisonment we hare
suffered, that we had not all of us read for
months and months before the prosecution
was heard of; and which, if we are not suff-
ciently satiated, we may read again upon the
file of every coffee-house in the Fingdomtt
is admitted distinetly by the crown, that ar-
form in the House of Commons is the osten-
sible purpose of all the proceedings laid before
you; and that the attzinment of that object
only, is the grammatical sense of the great
body of the written evidence.—It rests there-
fore with the crown, to show by reat PRoor
that this osrexsiste pu , and the whole
mass of correspondence upon the table, was
only a cloak to conceal a hidden machination,
to subvert by force the entire authorities of the
kingdom, and to assume them to themselves.
Whether a reform of parliament be a wise 0
an murine expedient; whether, if it were at-
complished, it would ultimately be
with benefits, er dangers, to the country, I
will not undertake to investigate, and for this
plain reason ; because it is wholly foreign ta
the’ subject before us.---But when we ar
trying the integrity of men’s intentions, and
are examining whether their complaints of
defects in the representation of the House of
Commons, be bond fide, or uty scere stalk-
ing-horse for treason and rebelfion, it becomes
a most essential inquiry, whether they be the
first who have uttered these complaints;—
whether they have taken up notions for the
first time, which never occurred to others;
and whether, in seeking to interfere practt
cally in an alteration of the constitution, the?
have manifested, by the novelty of their com
duct, a spirit inconsistent with for

rity. Gentlemen, I, for one, confess (for!
think the safest way of defendin ol ger
for his life before-an enlightened tribunsl, 5
defend him ingéenuouwsly), I, for one. co
that if the defects in the constitution of pet
liament, which ate the subject of the

and the foundation of all the proceedings’

fore you, had never occurred to other persons
at times, or, if not new, they had only
existed in the history of former conspiracies,
I should be afraid you would suspect, at least,
that the authors of them were plotters of mis-
ehief.—In such a case I should naturally ex-
that you would ask yourselves this ques-
tion—Why should it occur to the prisoner at
the bar, and to a few others in the year 1794,
immediately after an important revolution in
another country, to find fault, on a sudden,
with a constitution which had endured for
si without the imputation of defect, and
which no good subject had evet thought of
touching with the busy hand of reformation 2
I candidly admit that such a9 qiestion would
octur to the mind of every reasonable man,
4nd could admit no favourable answer—But
surely this admission entitles me, on the
othér hand, to the concession, that if, in com-
paring their writings, and examining their
conduct with the writings and conduct of the
best and most unsuspected persons in the best
and most unsuspected times, we find them
treading in the paths which have distinguished
their highest superiors; if we find them only
exposing the same defects, and pursuing the
asme or similar courses for their removal,—it
would be the height of wickedness and injus-
tice to torture expressions, and pervert con-
duct into treason aud rebellion, which had
recently lifted up others to the love of the
mation, to the confidence of the sovereign,
and to all the honours of the state. The na-
tural justness of this reasoning is so obvious,
that we have only to examine the fact; and,
considering under what auspices the prisoners
are brought before you, it may be fit that I
should set out with reminding you, that the
great earl of Chatham began and established
the fame and glory of his life upon the very
cause in which my unfortunate clients were
engaged, and that he left it as an inheritance
to the present minister of the crown, as the
foundation of his fame and glory after him ;
apd his fame and glory were accordingly
raised upon it; and if the crown’s evidence
bad been carried as far back as it might have
been (for the institution of only one of the two
Tshdon Societies is befote us), you would
have found that the Constitutional Society
éwed its earliest credit with the country, if
Rot its. very birth, to the Iabour of the present
winister, and its ptofessed principles to his
#race the duke of Richmond, high also in his
majesty’s present councils, whose plan of re-
form has) been clearly established by the
whele of the written evidence, and by
every withess examined for the crown, to
have: been the type and model of all the so-
éeties in the supposed conspiracy, and uni-

mats; and urged too with a boldness, which,


when the comparison comes to be made, wilt
leave in the back ground the strongest figures
in the writings on the table—I do not say
this sarcastically ; I mean to speak with the
greatest respect of his Grace, both with regard
to the wisdom and integrity of his conduct 3
for although I have always thought in politics
with the illustrious person whose letter wag
read to you; although I think, with Mr. Fox,
that annual parliaments and universal suffrage
would be nothing like an improvement in the
constitution ; yet I confess that I find it easier
to say so than to answer the duke of Rich.
mond’s arguments on the subject; and I must
say besides, speaking of his grace from a long
personal knowledge, which began when I was
counsel for his relation lord Keppel, that, ine
dependently of his illustrious rank, which se-
cures hin against the imputation of trifling
with its existence, he is a person of an en-
larged understanding, of extensive readin
and of much reflection; and that his boo
cannot therefore be considered as the effusion
of rashnessand folly, but as the well-weighed,
though perhaps erroneous, conclusions drawn
from the actual condition of our affairs, viz.
that without a speedy and essential reform in
parliament (and there my opinion goes along
with him) the very being of the country, as a
reat nation, would be last. This plan of the
uke of Richmond was the grand main spring
of every proceeding we have to deal with;—you,
have fea a great number of loose conversations
reported from societies, on which no reliance
can be had; sometimes they have been gare
bled by spies, sometimes misrepresented by
ignorance ; and even, if correct, have fres
quently been the extravagances of unknown
individuals, not even uttered in the presencd
of the prisoner, and totally unconnected with
any design; for whenever their proceeds’
are appealed to, and their real object examined;
by living members of them, brought beford
you by the crown, to testify them under thd
most solemn obligations of truth, they appear
tohave been following, in form and in subs
stance, the plans adopted within our memories,
not only by the duke of Richmond, but by hans
reds of the most eminent men in the. kingdom,
The duke of Richmond formally published his
lan of reform in the year 1780, in a letter to
ieutenant colonel Sharman, who was at that
time practically employed upon the same object
in Ireland; and this 1s a most material
of the case ; because yoware desired to behevd
that the terms Conventson, and Deteeares,
and the holding the one, and sending the other;
were all collected from what had recently Ws
ned. in France, and. were meant as the
‘ormal introduction of her republican constis
tution: but they who desire you to believd
all this, do not believe it themselves; because
they know certainly, and it has indeed already
been proved by-their own witnesses, that con-
ventions of reformers were held in Ireland,
and delegates regularly sent to them, while?
France was under the dominion of ber ancien$

government.—They knew full well that colo-
nel Sharman, to whom the duke’s letter was
addressed, was at that very moment supperting
a convention in Ireland, at the head of ten thou-
sand men inarms, for the defence of their coun-
try, without any commission from the king, any
more than poor Franklow had, who is now in
Newgate, for rcgimenting sixty.—These vol-
unteers asserted and saved the liberties of
Ireland; and the king would, at this day, have
had no more subjects iu Ireland than he now
has in America, if they had been treated as
traitors to the government.—It was never im-
puted to colonel Sharmar and the volunteers,
that they were in rebellion ,—yet they had
arms in their hands, which the prisoners never
dreamed of having; whilst a grand general
convention was actually sitting under their
auspices at the royal Exchange of Dublin, at-
tanted by regular delegates from all the coun-
ties in Ireland.—And who were these dcle-
gates iI will presently tear off their names
from this paper, and hand it to you.—They
were the greatest, the best, and proudest
names in Ireland;—men who had the wisdom
to reflect (before it was too late for reflection)
that greatness is not to be supported by tilting
at interiors, till, by the separation of the
higher from the lower orders of mankind,
every distinction is swept away in the
tempest of revolution; but in the happy
harmonization of the whole community ; by
conferring upon the people their rights ; sure
of receiving the auspicious return of affection,
and of ensusing the stability of the govern-
ment, which is erected upon that just and na-
tural basis.~Gentlemen, they who put this
tortured construction on conventions and de-
Togas, know also that repeated meetings of
reforming societies, both in England and
Scotland, had assumed about the same time
the style of conventions, and had been attended
by regular delegates, long before the phrase
, or could have, any existence in France;
and that upon the very model of these former
associations, a formal convention was actually
sitting at Edinburgh, with the lord chief
baron of Scotland in the chair, for promoting
areform in parliament, at the very moment
the Scotch Convention, following its example,
assumed that title.
. Toreturn to this letter of the duke of Rich-
mond :—It was written to colonel Sharman,
in answer to a letter to his grace, desiring to
know his plan of reform, which he accord-
ingly communicated by the letter which is in
evidence ; and which plan was neither more
nor less than that adopted by the prisoners, of
surrounding parliament (unwilling to reform
its own corruptians), yor by armed men, or
by importunate multitudes, but by the still
and universal voice of a whole people crarm-
1NG THEIR KNOWN AND UNALIENABLE RIGHTS.
~—Thisis so precisely the plan of the dake of
Richmond, that I have almost borrowed his
expressions. Lis grace says, “ The lesser re~

form has been attempted with every possible


advantage in its favour; not enly from the
zealous support of the advocates for a more
effectual one, but from the assistance of men
of great weight, both in and out of power.
But with all these temperaments and helps
it has failed. Not one proselyte has been
gained from corruption, nor has the least ray
of hope been held out from any quarter that
the House of Commons was inclined to

any other mode of reform. The weight of
corruption has crushed this more gentle, as it
would have defeated any more effieacious plan
in the same circumstances. From that quarter,
therefore, I have nothing to hope. Ir 1s rrow

this doctrine apply to the defence of the pre

cisive applieation ; because this book has beea
put into the hands of the: crown witnesses, .
who have one and all of them recognised it,
and declared it to have been, bona fide, the
plan which they pursued.

But are the crown’s witnesses worthy of
credit?—If they are not, let us return home,
since there is no evidence at all, and the cause
is over—All the guilt, if any there be, pro-
ceeds from their testimony ; if they are not
to be believed, they have proved nothing;
since the crown cannot force upon you that
part of the evidence which suits its purpose,
and ask you to reject the other which does not,
The witnesses are either entirely credible,
or undeserving ofall credit, and Ihaveno m-
terest in the alternative. This is precisely the
state of the cause.—For, with regard to all the
evidence that is written, let it never be for-
gotten, that itis not upon me to defend my
clients against it, but for the crown to extract
from it the materials of accusation.—They
do not contend that the treason is upon the
surface of it, but im the datent intention ; which
intention must, therefore, be supported by exe
trinsic proof; but which is nevertheless directly
negatived and beat down by every witmess
they have called, leaviag them nothing but
commentaries and criticisras against both feet
and language, to which, for the present, I
shall content myself with replying in the
authoritative lancuage of the Court, in the
earliest stage of the proceedings : .

“Tfthere be ground to consider the pro-
fessed purpose of any of these associations, «
reform in parliament, as mere colour, and as &
pretext held out in order to cover deeper de-
signs—designs against the whole constitution
and government of the country; the case of
those embarked in such designs is that which
T have already considered. Whether this be
so, Ae not, is mere matter os fact; as to which
I shall only remind you, that an inquiry into
acharge of this nature, which undertakes to
make out that the ostensible purpose is a mere

veil, under which is concealed a traitorous
conspiracy, requires cool and deliberate exami-
nation, and the most attentive consideration;
gnd that the result should be perfectly clear
and satisfactory. In the affairs of common
life, no man is justified in imputing to another
a meaning contrary to what he himself ex-

but upon the fullest evidence.” *—
i this (though it requires nothing to support
it, either in reason or authority) I desire to
add thedirection of lord chief justice Holt
to the jury, on the trial of sir John Parkyns:

« tlenren; it is not fit that there should
be any strained or forced construction put
upon a man’s actions when he is tried for his
life. You ought to have a full and satisfac-
tory evidence that he is guilty, before you
pronounce him so.”+
» In this assimilation of the writings of the
societies to the writings of the duke of Rich-
mond and others, I do not forget that it has
been truly said by the lord chief justice, in
the course of this very cause, that ten or
twenty men’s committing crimes, furnishes
no defence for other men in committing them.
Certainly it does not; and I fly to no such
sanctuary ; but in trying the prisoner’s inten-
tions, and the intentions of those with whom
he associated and acted, if I can show them
to be only insisting upon the same principles
that have distinguished the men most emi-
nent for wisdom and virtue in the country, it
will not be very easy to declaim or argue
them into the pains of death, whilst our Bo-
soms are glowing with admiration at the
works of those very persons who would con-
demn them.

Gentlemen, it has been too much the
fashion of late to overlook the genuine source
of all human authority, but more especially
totally to forget the character of the British
House of Commons as a representative of the
people ;—whether this has arisen trom that
assembly’s having itself forgotten it, would
be indecent for me to inquire into or to in-
sinuate ;—but I shall preface the authorities
which I-mean to collect in support of the
prisoner, with the opinion on that subject of
& truly celebrated writer, of whom I wish to
speak with great respect: I should, indeed,
be ashamed, particularly at this moment, to
name him invidiously, while he is bending

the pressure of a domestic misfor-
tune, which no man out of his own family
laments more sincerely than I do.{—No
difference of opinion can ever make me
forget to acknowledge the sublimity. of his
genius, the vast reach of his understanding,
and his universal acquaintance with the his-
tories and constitution of nations ; I also dis-
avow the introduction of the writings, with
Fa

the grand jury, who found the indictment,



the view of involving the author in any a
parent . inconsistencies, which would tend,
Indeed, to defeat rather than to advance my
purpose.—I stand here to-day to claim at
your hands, a fair and charitable interpreta-
tion of human conduct, and I shall not set
out with giving an example of uncharitable-
ness.—A man may have reason to change
his opinions, or perhaps the defect may be in
myself, who collect that they are changed ; I
leave it to God to judge of the heart—my
wish is, that christian charity may prevail ;—
that the public harmony, which has been lost,
may be restored ;—that all England may re-
unite in the bonds of love and affection ;—
and that when the court is broken up by the
sequel of the prisoners, all heart-burnings
and animosities may cease ;—that, whilst yet
we work in the light, we may try how we can
save our country by a common effort; and
that, instead of shamelessly setting one half
of society against the other by the force of
armed associations, and the terrors of courts
of justice, our spirits and our strength may
be combined in the glorious cause of our
country.—By this, I do not mean in the
cause of the present, war, which I protest
against as unjust, calamitous, and destructive;
but this is not the place for such a subject, I
only advert to it to prevent mistake or misre-
presentation.

The history and character of the English
House of Commons was formerly thus de-
scribed by Mr. Burke: “‘ The House of Com-
mons was supposed originally to be no part of
the standing government of this country, but
was considered asa control issuing immediately
from the people, and speedily to be resolved
iato the mass from whence it arose: in this
respect it was in the higher part of govern:
ment what juries are in the lower. The ca-
pacity of a magisteate being transitory, and
that of a citizen permanent, the latter capa+
city, it was hoped, would of course prepon-
derate in all discussions, not only between
the people and the standing authority of the
Crown, but between the people and the fleet-
ing authority of the House of Commons itself.
It was hoped, that, being of a middle nature,
Letween subject and government, they would
feel with a more tender and a nearer interest,
every thing that concerned the people, than
the other remoter and more permanent parts
of legislature.

‘“« Whatever alterations time and the neces-
sary accommodation of business may have
introduced, this character can never be sus-
tained, unless the House of Commons shall
be made to bear some stamp of the actual dis-
position of the ple at large: it would
(among public misfortunes) ‘be an evil. more
natural and tolerable, that the House of Com-
mons should be infected witb every epide-
mical frenay of the people, as this would indi-
cate some consanguinity, some sympathy of
nature with their constituents, than that they
should, in all cases, be wholly untouched by

the opinions and feelings of the’ people out of
dovrs. By this want of sympathy, they would
cease to be a House of Commons.

“ The virtue, spirit, and essence of a House
of Cummons, consists in its being the express
imige of the feelings of the nation. It was
Not instituted to be a control zpon the people,
as of late it has been taught, by a doctrine of
the most pernicious tendency, but as a con-
trol for the people.” ;

He then goes on to say, that to give a
technical shape, a colour, dress, and duration
{o popular opinion, is the true office of a House
of Cummons.—Mr. Burke is unquestionably
correct ;—the control upon the people is the
King’s majesty, and the hereditary privileges
of the peers ;—the balance of the state is the
control ror the people upon both, in the
existence of the House of Commons ;—but
how can that control exist ror the people, un-
less they have the actual electiun of the House
of Commons, which, it is most notorious, they
have not?—I hold in my hand a state of the
Yepresentation which, if the thing were not

otherwise notorious, I would prove to have '
been lately offered in proof to the House of :

Commons, by an honourable friend of mine
Dow present,* whuse motion J had the honour

to second, where it appeared that 12,000 '
people return near a majority of the House of '

Commons, and thuse again, under the control
of about 200. But though these facts were
admitted, all redress, and even discussion, was

tefused.—What ought to be said of a House :

of Commons that so conducts itself, it is not
for me to pronounce ; J will appeal, therefore,
to Mr. Burke, who says, “ that a House of
Commons, which in all disputes between the

people and administration presumes against |

the people, which punishes their disorders,
but refuses even to inquire into their provoca-
tions, is an unnatural, monstrous state of
things in the constitution.” $ :

But this is nothing: Mr. Burke goes on
afterwards to give a more full description of
Parliament, and in stronger language (let the
Solicitor General take it down for his reply),
than any that has been employed by those
who are to be tried at present as conspirators
against its existence.—I read the passage, to
warn you against considering hard words
against the House of Commons as decisive
evidence of treason against the King.—The

assage is in a well-known work, called,

houghts on the Causes of the present Dis-
contents; and such discontents will always
be present, whilst their causes continue.—
The word present will apply just as well now,

vation; and which the distresses and the
prosperity of the country equally tended to
augment, was an admirable substitute fora
prerogative, that, being only the offspring of
antiquated prejudices, had moulded in its ¢n-
ginal stamina irresistible principles of decay
and dissolution.” *

What is this but saying that the House of
Commons is a settled and scandalous abase
fastened upon the people, instead of being
an antagonist power for their protection; an
odious instrument of power in the hands of
the Crown, instead of a popular balance
against it?’ Did Mr. Burke mean that the
prerogative of the crown, properly b
and exercised, was an antiquated prejudice?
Certainly not; because his attachment toa
properly balauced monarchy is notorious>—-
why then is it to be fastened upon the Bas
soners, that they stigmatize monarchy,
they also exclaim ma ainst its corruptions?
In the same manner, aloe he speaks of the
abuses of parliament, would it be fair in Mr.
Burke to argue, from the strict legal meaning
of the expression, that he included, in the
censure on parliament, the king's person, of
majesty, which is part of the parliament? Ia
examining the work of an author you mast
collect the sense of his expressions from ths
subject he is discussing ; and if he is wns
of the House of Commons as it affects
structure and efficacy of the government, you
ought to understand. the word parliament s2
as to meet the sense and obvious roeaning of
the writer—Why then is this common ju
tice refused to others?—W hy is the wo

jaterpreted in its papular, though less correct
acceptation, in the works of the most distin-

is] scholar of .the age?—Add to this,
that the cases are nat atall similar: for Mr.
Burke uses the ward parliament throughaut,
when he is speaking af the House of Com-
mans, without any cancamitant words which
conyey an explanation, but the sense of his
subject; whereas parliament is fastened
upon the prisoner ag meaning something be,
yond the House of Commons, when it can
have na possible meaning beyond jt; since
from the beginning to the ead it is joined
with the words representugion of the people :—
the representation af the people in parlia-
ment!—Does not this most palpably. mean
the House of Commons, when we know that
the people have no representation in either
of the other branches of the government ?

A letter has been read in evidence from
Mr. Hardy to Mr. Fos, where he says their
object was universal representation. Did
Mr. Fox suppose, when he received this letter,
that it was from a nest of republicans, cla-
mouring publicly for an universal representa-
tive constitution like that of France ?—If he
had, would he have sent the answer he did,
and agreed to present their petition ?—They
wrote also to the Society of the Friends of the
People, and invited them to.send delegates to
the Convention :—the attorney-general, who
has made honourable and candid mention of
that body, will not suppose that it would have
contented itself with’ refusing the invitation
in terms of cordiality and r , if, with all
the knowledge they had of their transactions,
they had conceived themselves to have been
invited to the formation of a body, which was
to over-rule and extinguish all the authorities
of the state; yet upon the perversion of these
two terms, parliament and convention, against
their natural interpretation, against a similar
use of them by others, and against the solemn
explanation of them by the Crown’s own
witnesses, this whole fabric of terror and ac-
cusation stands for its support: letters, it
seems, written to other people, are to be better
understood by the gentlemen round this
table, who never saw them till months after
they were written, than by.those to whom,
they were addressed and sent; and no right |
interpretation, forsooth, is. to ie. expected

m writings when pursued: in their regular
series, but they are to he made distinct by:
binding them up. in a large volume, alongside.
of others totally unconnected with them, and)
the very existence of: whose authors was. un-
known to one another. ,

I will now, gentlemen, resume the reading
of another. part. of Mc. Burke, and.a pretty.
account. it is of this same parliament: “ They.
who will not conform their conduct. to the
public good, and. cannot support it by. the.
Prerogative of the. crown, have adopted a new.

. They have totally abandoned the shat-
tered and old-fashioned fortress of preroga-
lve, and made a lodgment in the strong-hold.

U


of parliament itself, If they have any evil
design to which there is no ordinary legal

wer cdmmensurate, they bring it into par-
iament.. There the whole is executed trom
the beginning to the end: and the power of
obtaining their object absolute, and the safety
in the proceeding perfect ; no rules to confine,
nor after-reckonings to terrify. For parliament
cannot, with any great propriety, punieh
atherg, far things in which they themselves
have been accomplices. Thus its control
upon the executive power is lost.”

This is a proposition universal. It is not
that the popular contral was lost under this
or that administration, but, GenERaLty, that
the people have no control in the House of
Commons. Let any map stand up and say
that he disbelieves this to be the case; I be-
lieve he would fiad nobody. to believe him,
Mr. Burke pursues the subject thus: “The
distempers of monarchy. were the great sub-
jects Cf appreension and redress ip the dust
century—in this, the distempess of parlia-
ment.” Here the word parliament, and the
abuses belonging to it, are put in express op-

osition to the monarchy, and cannot there
ore comprehend it: the distempers of parlia-
ment then are objects of setious apprehension
and redress. What distempers? Not of this
or that year, but tbe habitual distempers of
parliament; and then follows the nature of
the remedy, which shows that the prisoners
are not singular in thinking that it is by rae
VOICE OF THE PEOPLE ONLY that parliament
can be corrected. “It is not in parliament
alone,” says Mr. Burke, “ that the remedy
for parliamentary disorders can be completed;
and hardly indeed can it begin there. Until
a confidence in government is re-established,
the people ought to be excited to a more
strict and detailed attention to the conduct
of their representatives. Standards for judg-
ing more systematically upon their conduct
ought to be settled in the meetings of coun-
ties. and corporations, and yent and cor-
rect lists of. the voters in all important ques-
tions, ought to be procured. By such means
something may be done.”’+

It was the same sense of the impossibility of
a reform in parliament, without a general ex-
pression of the wishes of the people, that dic»

: tated: the duke of Richmond’s ‘Letter : all the

petitions in 1780 had been rejected: by parlia-
ment;—this made the duke of Richmond ex-
claim, that from that qnarter no redress was
to be expected, and that from. the people alone
he expected.any good ; and he, therefore, ex-
pressly invited them to claim and to assert an’
equal representation as their indubitable and
unalienable birth-right:—-how to assert their
rights, when parliament had already refused
them without even the hope, as the duke ex-
pressed it, of: listening to them gny more?
a cS RS


Could the people’s rights, under such circum-
stances, be asserted without rebellion? Cer-
tainly they might: for rebellion is, when
bands of men within a state oppose them-
selves, by violence, to the general will, as ex-

ressed or implied by the public authority ;

ut the sense of a whole people, peaceably col-
lected, and operating by its natural and cer-
tain effect upon the public councils, is not re-
bellion, but is paramount to, and the parent
of, authority itself. .

Gentlemen, I am neither vindicating, nor
speaking, the language of inflammation or dis-
content;—I shall speak nothing that can dis-
turb the order of the state; I am full of devo-
‘tion to its dignity and tranquillity, and would
not for worlds let fall an expression in this or
in any other place that could lead to disturb-
ance or disorder:—but for that very reason, I
speak with firmness of THE RIGHTS OF THE
PEOPLE, and am anxious for the redress of
their complaints ; because J believe a system
of attention to them to be a far better security
and establishment of every part of the govern-
ment, than those that are employed to pre-
serve them.—The state and government of a
country rest, for their sappart, on the great
body of the people, and I hope never to hear
it repeated, in any court of justice, that peace-
ably to convene the people upon the subject
of their own potaleges can lead to the de-
struction of the king:—they are the king’s
worst enemies who hold this language.—It is
a most dangerous principle, that the crown is
in jeopardy, if the people are acquainted with
their rights, and that the collecting them to-
gether to consider of them, leads inevitably
to the destruction of the sovereign.— Do these
gentlemen mean to say that the king sits
upon his throne without the consent, and in
defiance of the wishes of the great body of his
people, and that he is kept upon it by a few
individuals who call themselves his friends,
in exclusion of the rest of his subjects ?—Las
the king’s inheritance no deeper or wider
roots than this? Yes, sratiemen, it has—it
sands upon the love of the people, who consi-

ler their own inheritance tobe supported by
the king’s constitutional authority: this is


men. It is from the revered work of Mr,
Locke, and not from the revolution.in France,
that one of the papers in the evidence, the:
most stigmatized, most obviously flowed ; for
it is proved that Mr. Yorke held in his hand
Mr. Locke upon government, when he deli-
vered his speech on the Castle-hill at Shef-
field, and that he expatiated largely upon it;
—well, indeed, might the witness say he ex-

atiated largely, for there are many well-se-
lected passages taken verbatim from the book;
and here, in justice to Mr. White,® let me no-
tice the fair and honourable manner in which,
in the absence of the clerk, he read this ex-
traordi performance. He delivered it not
merely with distinctness, but in a manner s
impressive, that, I believe, every man in
court was affected by it.

Gentlemen, I am not driven to defend every
expression; some of them are undoubtedly
improper, rash, and inflammatory ; but I see
nothing in the whole taken together, even if
it were connected with the prisoner, that goes
atallto an evil purpose in the writer. But
Mr. Attorney General has remarked upon
this proceeding at Sheffield (and whatever
falls from a person of his rank and just esti-
mation, deserves great attention), he has re-
marked that it is quite apparent they had re-
solved not to petition.—They bad certainly re-
solved not at thut season to petition, and that
seems the utmost which can be maintained
from the evidence.—But supposing they bad
negatived the measure altogether ; is there no
way by which the people may actively asso
ciate for the purposes of a retorm in parlis-
ment, but to consider ofa petition to the House
of Commons? Might they not legally as
semble to consider the state of their liberties,
and the conduct of their representatives ?—
Might they not legally form conventions or
meetings (for the name is just nothing) toad
just a plan of rational union for a wise choice
of representatives when parliament should be
dissolved P—May not the people meet to con-
sider their interests preparatory to, and inde-
pendently of, a petition for any specific object?
—My friend seems to consider the House of
Commons as a substantive and permanent

the true prop of the throne; and the love of | part of the constitution ;—he seems to forget

every people upon earth will for ever uphold
@ government, founded, as ours is, upon rea-
son and consent, as long as government shall
be itself attentive to the general interests
which are the foundations and the ends of all
human authority.—Let us banish then these
unworthy and impolitic fears of an unrestrain-
_ edand an enlightened people ;—let us not
tremble at the rights of man, but, by giving
to men their rights, secure their affections,
and, through their affections, their obedience ;
—let us not broach the dangerous doctrine
that the rights of kings and of men are incom-
seal ur government at the Revolution
ye an upon their harmonious incorporation ;
and Mr. Locke defended king William's title

1

that the parliament dies a natural death;—
that the people then re-enter into their rights,
and that the exercise of them is the most im-
rtant duty that can belong to social man —
ow are such duties to be exercised with effect,
on momentous occasions but by concert and
communion?—May not the peopleassembledin
their elective districts, resolve to trust no lon-
ger those by whom they have been betrayed?
May they not resolve to vote for no map who
contributed by his voice to this calamitous
war, which has thrown such grievous and u
necessary burthens upon them? May
not say, “We will not vote for those who

deny we are their constituents; not for those
who question our clear and natural right to be
equally represented ?”"—Since it is illegal to
carry up petitions, and unwise to transact any
public business attended by multitudes, be-
cause it tends to tumult and disorder, may
they not, for that very reason, depute, as they
have done, the most trusty of their societies
to meet with one another to consider, without
the specific object of petitions, how they ma:

claim, by means which are constitutional,
their imprescriptible rights? And here I
must advert to an argument employed by the
attorney-general, that the views of the socie-
ties towards universal suffrage, carried in
themselves (however sought to be effected)
animplied force upon parliament :—for that,
supposing by invading It with the vast pres-
sure, not of the fips arm, but of the pub-
lic sentiment of the nation, the influence of
which upon that assembly is admitted ought
to be weighty, it could have prevailed upon
the Commons to carry up a bill to the king
for universal representation and annual par-
liaments, his majesty was bound to reject
it; and could not, without a breach of his
coronation oath, consent to pass it into an
act;—I cannot conceive where my friend
met with this law, or what he can possibly
mean by asserting that the king cannot, con-
sistently with his: coronation cath, consent
to any law thatcan be stated orimagined, pre-
sented to him 4s the act of the two Houses of
parliament:—he could not, indeed, consent
to abill sent up to him framed bya conven-
tion of delegates assuming legislative func-
tions; and if my friend could have proved
that the societies, sitting as a parliament, had
sent up such a bill to his majesty, I should
have thought the prisoner, as a member of
such a parliament, was at least in a different
situation from that in which he stands at pre-
sent: but as this is not one of the chimeras
whose existence is contended for, I return back
to ask, .upon what authority it is maintained,
that universal representation and annual par-
liaments could not be consented to by the
king, in conformity to the wishes of theother
branches of the Jegislature :—on the contrary,
one of the greatest men that this country
ever saw considered universal representation
to be such an inherent part of the constitution
as that the king himself might grant it by his
prerogative, even without the Lords and Com-
mons; and I have never heard the position
denied upon any other footing than the union
with Scotland.—But be that as it may, it is
enough for my purpose that the maxim, that
the king might grant universal representation,
as a right betore inherent in the whole peo-
ple to be represented, stands upon the autho-
rity of Mr. Locke, the man, next to sir Isaae
Newton, of the greatest strength of under-
standing that England, perhaps, ever had;
high too in the favourof king William, and en-
joying one of the most axalied offices in the
state.—Dr. Locke says, book 2d, ch, 13, sect.


157 and 158—“ Things of this world are in so’
constant a flux, that nothing remains long im
the same state. Thus people, riches, trade,
power, change their stations, flourishing
mighty cities come to ruin, and prove, in
time, neglected, desolate corners, whilst other
unfrequented places grow into populous coun-
tries, hlled with wealth and inhabitants. But
things not always changing equally, and pri-
vate interest often keeping up customs and
privileges, when the reasons of them are ceas-
ed, it often comes to pass, that in governments,
where part of the legislative consists of repre-
sentatives chosen by the people, that in tract
of time this representation becomes very un~
equal and igpreorrisuate to the reasons it
was at first established upon. To what gross
absurdities the following of custom, when
reason has left it, may lead, we may be satis~
fied, when we see the bare name of a town, of
which there remains not so muchas the ruins,
where scarce so much housing as a sheep-
cote, or more inhabitants than a shepherd is
to be found, sends as many representatives to
the grand assembly of law-makers, as a whole
county, numerous in people, and powerful in
Tiches. This strangers stand amazed at, and’
every one must confess needs a remedy.”

“ Salus populi suprema lex, is certainly so
just and fundamental a rule, that he who
sincerely follows it, cannot dangerously err.
If, therefore, the executive, who has the
power of convoking the legislative, observin:
rather the true proportion, than fashion of}
representation, regulates, not by old custom,
but true reason, the number of members in all
places that have a right to be distinctly
represented, which no part of the people,
however incorporated, can pretend to, but in
proportion to the assistance which it affords
to the public, it cannot be judged to have set
up a new legislative, but to have restored the
old and true one, and to have rectified the
disorders which succession of time had insen-
sibly, as well as inevitably introduced ; for it
being the interest as well as intention of the
people to have a fair and equal representative;
whoever brings it nearest to that, is an un-
doubted fricnd to, and establisher of the
government, and cannot miss the consent
and approbation of the community; prera-

ative lang nothing but @ power, in the

ands of the prince, to provide for the public
good, in such cases, which depending upon’
unforeseen and uncertain occurrences, certain
and unalterable laws could not safely direct ;
whatsoever shall be done manifestly for the
good of the people, and the establishing the
government upon its true foundations, is, and
always will be, just prerogative. Whatsoever
cannot but be acknowledged to be of advan-
tage to the society, and people in general,
upon just and lasting measures, will always,
when done, justify itself; and whenever the
ople shall choose their representatives upon
just and undeniably equal measures, suitable
to the original frame of the government, it


cannot be doubted to be the will and act of | whole public, and of which, to avoid the very

the society, whoever permitted or caused
them so to do.”—-But as the very idea of
universal suffrage seems now to be considered
not only to be figeiraes to, but absolutely
destructive of monarchy, you certainly ought
to be reminded that the book which I have
been reading, and which my friend kindly gives
me a note to remind you of, was written by
its immortal author in defence of king Wil-
Tiam’s title to the crown; and when Dr.
Sacheverel * ventured to broach those doc-
trines of power and non-resistance, which,
under the same establishments, have now
become so unaccountably popular; he was
impeached by the pecple’s representatives

for denying their rights, which had been
‘asserted and established at the glorious era
of the Revolution,

Gentlemen, if I were to go through all the
matter which I have collected upon this
subject, or which obtrudes it upon my mind
from common reading, in a thousand direce
tions, my strength would fail long before my
duty was fulfilled; I had very little when E
came into court, and I have abundantly less
already; I must, therefore, manage what
Temains to the best advantage; and shall
proceed, now, to take a view of such parts of
the evidence as appear to me to be the most
material for the proper understanding of the
case; I have had no opportunity of consi-
dering it, but in the interval which the indul-
gence of the Court, and your own, has afforded
me, and that has been but for a very few
hours this <sbe p but it occurred to me,
that the best use I could make of the time

iven to me was, if possible, to disembroil

is chaos ; to throw out of view every thing
irrelevant, which only tended to bring chaos
back again—to take what remained in order
of time—to select certain stages and resting
places—to review the effect of the transac-
tions, ds brought before us, and then to see
how the written evidence is explained by the
testimony of the witnesses who have been
examined, ;
. Fhe origin of the Constitutional Society not
Roving bod laid im evidence before you, the
chief thing both in point of date, and as apply-
ing to show the objects of the different bodies
is the original address and resolution of the
Corresponding: Society on its institution, and
when it first to correspond with the
vther, which formerly ranked amongst
its members so many illustrious persons ; and
before we look to the matter of this institu-
tion, let us: recollect that the objects of it
were given without reserve to the public, as
containing the principles of the association ;
and I may — with demanding, whether
the-annals of this country, or indeed the uni
versal history of mankind, afford an ‘instance
of a plot-and conspiracy vo! ily given up
in its very infancy to government, and the
tn


pied: that has happened, the arraignment of
conduct at a future period, and the imputation
of secrecy where no secret was intended, a
Tegular notice by letter was left with the
secretary of state, and a receipt taken at the
public office, as a proof of the publicity of
their (pee and the sense they enter-
tained of their innocence. For the views and
objects of the society, we must look to the
institution itself, which you are, indecd, de-
sired to look at by the crown; for their in
tentions are not considercd as deceptions in
this instance, but as plainly revealed by the
very writing itself.

Gentlemen, there was a sort of silence in
the Court—I do not say an affected one, for E
mean no possible offente to any one, but there
seemed to be an effect expected from begin-
ning, not with the address itself, but with the
very bold motto to it, though in verse :

“ Unblest by virtue, government a league

“ Becomes, a circling junto of the great

“ To rob by law; religion mild, a yoke

“To tame the stooping soul, a trick of state

“ To mask their rapine, and to share the prey.
‘“‘ Without it, what are senates, but a face

“ Of consultation deep and reason free,

“ While the determin’d voice and heart are sold?
“ What, boasted freedom, buta soundingname 2?
“ And what election, but a market vile,

S$ Of slaves self-barter’d ?””

I almost fancy L heard them say to me,
What think you of that to set out with —
Show me the parallel of that —Gentlemen, I
am sorry, for ie credit of the age we live in,
to answer, that it is difficult to find the
parallel; becanse the age aflords no such poet
as he who wrote it:—these are the words
of Thomson :—and it is under the banners of
his Peoverbial benevolence, that these men
are supposed to be engaging in plams of
anarchy: oe murder; Unie “the banners of
that great and good man, whose you
may still see in the venerable s of
Hagley, placed there by the virtuous, accom-
plished, and public-spirited Lyttelton :—the
very poem too, written under the auspices of
his majesty’s royal father, when heir- apparené
to the crown of Great Britain, nay, withm the
very walls of Carlton-house, which afforded am
asylum to matchless worth and gennis in the
person of this great poet; it was under the
roof of a Prince or Wates that the poem of

than to blazon, in immortal numbers, the only

men ere prepering at this moment (may my
name descend amongst them to the it
posterity!) to do honour to his immortal
memory. Pardon me, gentlemen, for this
desultory digression.—I must express myself
as the current of my mind will c: me.

Tf wa look at the whole of the institution
itself, it exactly corresponds with the plan of
the duke of Richmond, as expressed in the
letters to colonel Sharman, and to the high
sheriff of Sussex: this plan they propose to
follow, in a public address to the nation, and
all their resolutions are framed for its accom-
plishment; and I desire to know in what
they have departed from either, and what
they have done which has not been done be-
fore, without blame or censure, in the pursu-
ance of the same object. I am not speaking
of the libels they may have written, which the
law is open to punish, but what part of their
conduct has, as applicable to the subject in

uestion, been unprecedented. —I have, at
this moment, in my eye, an honourable friend
of mine, and a distinguished member of the
House of Commons, who, in my own remem-
brance, I believe in 1780, sat publicly at
Guildhall, with many others, some of them
magistrates of the city, as a convention of
delegates, for the same objects ;* and what is
etill more in point, just before the convention
began to meet at Edinburgh, whose proceed-
ings have been so much relied on, there was a
convention regularly assembled, attended b
the delegates from all the counties of Scotland,
for the express and avowed purpose of alter-
ang (be constitution of parlament; not by
rebellion, but by the same means employed
by the prisoner:—the lord chief baron of
Scotland sat in the chair, and was assisted b:
some of the first men in that country, an
amongst others, by an honourable person to
whom I am nearly allied, who is at the very
head of the bar in Scotland, and most avowedly
attached to the law and the constitution.+
These gentlemen, whose good intentions
never fell into suspicion, had presented a
petition for the alteration of election laws,
which the House of Commons had rejected,
and on the spur of that very rejection they
met ina Convention at Edinburgh in 1793 ;
and the style of their first meeting was, “A
Convention of D tes, chosen from the
counties of Scotland, for Altering and Amend-
ing the Laws concerning Elections” —not for
considering how they might be best amended
—not for petitioning parliament to amend
them ; but for altering and amending the
election laws.—These meetings were regularly
published, and [ will prove, that their first

resolution, as I have read it to you, was
brought up to London, and delivered to the
editor of the Morning Chronicle by sir Thomes
Dundas, lately created a peer of Great Britain,
and paid for by him as a public advertisement.
Now, suppose any man had imputed treason
or sedition:to these honorable persons, what
would have been the consequence? They
would have been considered as infamous
libellers and traducers, and deservedly hooted
out of civilized life :—why then are different
constructions to be put upon similar transac-
tions ?—Why is every thing to be held up as
boné fide when the example is set, and malé
Jide when it is followed ?—Why have I not as
good a claim to take credit for honest purpose
in the poor man I am defending, against
whom not a contumelious expression has
been proved, as when we find the same ex-
pressions in the mouths of the duke of Rich-
moond or Mr. Burke?—I ask nothing more
from this observation, than that a sober judg-
ment may be pronounced from the quality of
the acts which can be fairly established; each
individual standing responsible only for his
own conduct, instead of having our imagina-
tions tainted with cant phrases, and a farra;
of writings and speeches, for which the pri-
soner is not responsible, and for which the
authors, if they be criminal, are liable to be
brought to justice.

But it will be said, gentlemen, that all the
constitutional privileges of the people are con-
ceded; that their existence was never denied
or invaded; and that their right to petition
and to meet for the expression of their com-
plaints, founded or unfounded, was never
called in question; these, it will be said, are
the rights of subjects ; but that the “ rights of
man” are what alarms them: every one is
considered as @ traitor who talks about the
“rights of man;” but this bugbear stands’
upon the same perversion with its fellows.

The rights of man are the foundation of all
government, and to secure them is the only
reason of men’s submitting to be governed ;—
it shall not be fastened upon the unfortunate
prisoner at the bar, nor upon any other man,
that because these natural rights were asserted
in France, by the destruction of a government
which oppressed and subverted them, a pro-
cess happily effected here by slow and imper-
ceptible improvements, that therefore they
can only be so asserted in England, where the
government, through a gradation of improve-
ment, is well calculated to protect them. We
are, fortunately, not driven in this country to
the terrible alternatives which were the un-
happy lot of France, because we have had a
happier destiny in the forms of a frec consti-
tution; this, indeed, is the express language
of many of the papers before you, that have
been complained of; particularly in one
alluded to by the Attorney General, as javing
been written by a gentleman with whom
am particularly acquainted; and though in
that spirited composition there are, perhaps,

some expressions proceeding from warmth
which he may not desire me critically to
justify, yet I will venture to affirm, from my
own personal knowledge, that there is nota
man in Court more honestly public-spirited
and zealously devoted to the constitution of
King, Lords, and Commons, than the honour-
able gentleman I allude to (Felix Vaughan,
esq. Tarcister at law*). It is the phrase,
therefore, and not the sentiment expressed by
it, that can alone give justifiable offence ;~-it
is, it seems, a new phrase commencing in revo-
lutions, and never used before in discussing
the rights of British subjects, and therefore
can only be applied in the sense of those who
framed it ;—but this is-so far from being the
truth, that the very phrase sticks in my
memory, from the repeated application of it to
the rights of subjects, under this and every
other establishment, by a gentleman whom
‘you will not suspect of using it in any other
sense. The rights of man were considered by
“Mr. Burke, at the time that the great uproar
was made upon a supposed invasion of the
East India Company's charter, to be the
foundation of, and paramount to all, the laws
and ordinances of a state :—the ministry, you
may remember, were turned out for Mr. Fox’s
India Bill, which their opponents termed an
attack upon the chartered rights of man, or,
in other words, upon the abuses supported by
a monopoly in trade. Hear the sentiments of
Mr. Burke, when the NATURAL and
CHARTERED rights of men are brought
into contest. Mr. Burke, in his speech in the
House of Commons, expresscd himself thus :
« The first objection is, that the bill is an at-
tack on the chartered rights of men. As to
this objection, I must observe that the phrase
of ‘the chartered rights of men,’ is full of
affectation ; and very unusual in the discussion
of privileges conferred by charters of the
present description. But it is not difficult to
discover what end that ambiguous mode of
expression, so often reiterated, is meant to
answer.

“The rights of men, that is to say, the
natural rights of mankind, are indeed sacred
things; and if any public measure is proved
mischievously to affect them, the objection
ought to be fatal to that measure, even if no
charter at all could be set up against it.—And
if these natural rights are farther affirmed and
declared by express convenants, clearly defi-
ned and secured against chicane,, power, and
authority, by written instruments and positive
engagements, they are in a still better condi-
tion; they then partake not only of the sanc-
tity of the object so secured, but of that
solemn public faith itself, which secures an
object of such importance. . Indeed, this

formal recognition, by the sovereign power,
of an original right in the subject, can never
be subverted, but by rooting up the holding
radical principles of government, and even of
society itself.” *

The Duke of Richmond also, in his publie
letter to the High Sheriff of Sussex, rests the
rights of the people of England upon the
same horrible and damnable principle of the
rights of man.—Let gentlemen, therefore, take
care they do not pull down the very authority
which they come here to support ;—let them
remember, that his Majesty’s family was
called to the Throne upon the very principle,
that the ancient Kings of this country had
violated those sacred trusts ;—let them recol-
lect too in what the violation was ch: to
exist ;—it was charged by the Bill of Rights
to exist in cruel] ant infamous trials; m the
packing of juries; and in disarming the people,
whose arms are their unalienable retuge
against oppression.—But did the people of
England assemble to make this decleration?
—No!—because it was uonecessary.-—The
sense of the people, sent a corrupt and
scandalous government, dissolved it, by almost
the ordinary forms by which the old govern-
ment itself was administered. K img William
sent his writs to those who had sat in the
former Parliament: but will any man, there-
fore, tell me, that that Parliament reorgani
the government without the will of the le?
and that it was not their consent which en-
tailed on King William a particular inheritance,
to be enlaved under the dominion of the law?
Gentlemen, it was the denial of these princi
ples, asserted at the revolution in En;
that brought forward the author of the Ri
of Man, and stirred up this controversy which
has given such alarm to Government :—but
for this the literary labours of Mr. Paine hsd
closed.—He asserts it himself in his book,
and every body knows it—It was not the
French revolution, but Mr. Burke's Reflec
tions upon it, followed up by another work o1
the same subject, as it regarded things in Eng-
land, which brought forward Mr. Paine, and
which rendered his works so much the object
of attention in this country—Mr. Burke
denied positively the very foundation upon
which the revolution of 1688 must stand for
its support, viz. the right of the people to
change their government ; and he asserted, m
the teeth of His Majesty’s title to the Crown,
that no such right in the people existed ;—
this is the true history of the Second Part of
the Rights of Man.—The First Part had little
more aspect to this country than to Japan ;—
it asserted the right of the people of France
to act as they had acted, but there was litte
which pointed to it as an example for Eng-
land.—There had been a despotic authority
in France which the people liad thrown down,
and Mr. Burke seemed to question their right



to do so:—Mr. Paine maintained the contrary
in his answer ; and having imbibed the princt-
ples of republican government, during the
«\merican revolution, he mixed with the con-
troversy many coarse and harsh remarks upon
monarchy as established, even in England, or
in any possible form.— But this was collateral
to the great object of his work, whiclt was to
maintain the right of the people to choose
their government ;—this was the right which
‘was questioned, and the assertion of it was
most interesting to many who were most
strenuously attached to the English govern-
ment; since men may assert the right of
every people to choose their government
without seeking to destroy their own. ‘This
accounts for mapy expressions imputed to the
unfortunate prisoners, which I have often
uttered myself, and shall continue to utter
every day of my life, and call upon the spies
of government to record them :—I witt say
ANY WHERE, WITHOUT FEAR, NAY, I WILL say
HERE, WHERE I STAND, THAT AN ATTEMPT TO
INTERFERE, BY DESPOTIC COMBINATION AND
VIOLENCE, WITH ANY GOVERNMENT WHICH A
PEOPLE CHOOSE TO GIVE TO THEMSELVES, WHE-
THER IT BE GOOD OR EVIL, IS AN OPPRESSION
AND SUBVERSION OF THE NATURAL AND UN-
ALIENABLE RIGHTS OF MAN; AND THOUGH THE
GOVERNMENT OF THI3 COUNTRY SHOULD COUN-
TENANCE SUCH A SYSTEM, IT WOULD NOT ONLY
BE STILL LEGAL FOR ME TO EXPRESS MY DETES-
TATION OF 17, a3 | HERE DELIBERATELY EX-
PRESS 1T, RUT IT WOULD BECOME MY INTEREST
AND My DuTY. For, IF COMBINATIONS OF
DESPOTISM CAN ACCOMPLISH SUCH A PURPOSE,
WHO SHALL TELL ME, WHAT OTHER NATION
SHALL NOT BE THE PREY OF THEIR AMBITION?
—Upon the very principle of denying to a
people the right uf governing themselves, how
are we toresist the I'rench, should they attempt
by violence to fasten their government upon
us? Or, what inducement would there be for
resistance to preserve laws, which are not, it
seems, our own, but which are unalterably
imposed upon us?—The very argument strikes,
as with a palsy, the arm and vigour of the
nation.---I Pold dear the privileges I am con-
tending for, not as privileges hostile to the
constitution, but as necessary for its preserva-
tion; and if the French were to intrude by
force upon the government of our own free
choice, t should leave these papers, and return
toa potemior that, perhaps, I better under-
stand.

The next evidence relied on, after the insti-
tution of the Corresponding Society, isa letter
written to them from Norwich, dated the 11th
of November 1792, with the answer, dated the
26th of the same month :—It is asserted, that
this correspondence shows, they aimed at no-
thing less than the total destruction of the mo-
narchy, and that they, therefore veil their in-
tention under covert and ambiguous language.
~I think, on the other hand, and I shall
continue to think so, as long as I am capable
of thought, that it was impossible for words


to convey more clearly the explicit avowal of
their original plan for a constitutional reform
in the House of Commons. This letter from
Norwich, after congratulating the Corres-
ponding Society. on its institution, asks
several questions arising out of the proceed-
ings of other societies in different parts of the
kingdom, which they profess not thoroughly
to understand.

The Sheffield people (they observe) seemed
at first determined to support the Duke of
Richmond's plan only, but that they had
afterwards observed a disposition in them to
@ more moderate plan of reform proposed by
the Friends of the People in London; whilst
the Manchester people, by addressing Mr.
Paine (whom the Norwich people had not
addressed) seemed to be intent on republican
principles only; they thercfore-put a question,
not at all of distrust, or suspicion, but boné
Jide, if ever there was good faith between men,
whether the Corresponding Society meant to
be satisfied with the plan of the Duke of
Richmond? or, whether it was their private
design to rip up monarchy by the roots, and
place democracy in its stead? Now hear the
answer, from whence it is inferred that this
last is their intention: they begin their answer
with recapitulating the demand of their cor-
respondent, as regularly as a tradesinan, who
has had an order for goods, recapitulates the,
order that there may be no ambiguity in the
refcrence or application of the repl. , and then
they say as to the objects they have in view
they refer them to their addresses. “ You
will thereby see that they mean to disseminate
political knowledge, and thereby engage the
judicious part of the nation to demand the
RecovERY of their tost rights in ANNUAL
Parliaments; the members of these Parlia-
ments owing their election to unbought suf-
frages."—-They then desire them to be careful
to avoid all dispute, and say to them, Put mo-
narchy, democracy, and even religion, quite
aside; and “ Let your endeavours go te in-
crease the numbers of those who desire a full
and equal representation of the people, and
leave to a Parliament, so chosen, to reform
all existing abuses; and if they don’t answer,
atthe year’s end you may choose others in
their stead.” The Attorney General says,
this is lamely expressed ;—I, on the other
hand, say, that it is not only not lamely
expressed, but anxiously worded to put an end
to dangerous spcculations.—Leave all theories
undiscussed ;—do not perplex yourselves with
abstract questions of government ;—endea-
vour practically to get honest representatives,
—and if they deceive you—then, what?—
bring on a revolution ?—No !—Choose others
in their stead. They refer also to their ad-
dress, which lay before their correspon-
dent, which address expresses itself thus:
“ Laying aside all claim to originality, we
claim no other merit than that of reconsi-
dering and verifying what has already been
urged in our common cause by the Duke

t

of Richmond and Mr. Pitt, and their then
honest party.”

When the language of the letter, which is:
branded as ambiguous, thus stares them in |
the face as an undeniable answer to the,
charge, they then have recourse to the old |
refuge of mala fides ; all this they say is but a
cover for hidden treason;—but I ask you,
Gentlemen, in the name of God, and as fair
and honest men, what reason upon earth
there is to suppose, that the writers of this
letter did not mean what they expressed?
Are you to pag in a Court of Justice, and

n atrial for life, that men write with du-
plicity in their most confidential correspon-
dence, even to those with whom they are

+ confederated?—Let it be recollected also, that
if this correspondence was calculated for de-
ception, the deception must have been under-
stood and agreed upon by all parties concerned;
for otherwise you have a conspiracy amongst
persons who are at cross purposes with one
another: consequently the conspiracy, if’ this
be a branch of it, is @ conspiracy of thov- |
sands and ten thousands, from one end of
the kingdom to the other, who are all guilty,
if any uf the Prisoners are guilty :—upwards
of forty thousand persons, upon the lowest
calculation, must alike be liable to the pains
and penalties of the law, and hold their lives
as tenants at will of the Ministers of the
Crown.—In whatever aspect, therefore, this
prosecution is regarded, new difficulties and
new uncertainties and terrors surround it.

The next thing in order which we have to
Jook at, is the Convention at Edinburgh—It
ir that a letter had been written by Mr.
Skirving, who was connected with reformers
in Scotland proceeding avowedly upon the
duke of Richmond’s plan, proposing that
there should be a convention from the socie-
ties assembled at Edinburgh :—now you will
recollect, in the apart that the attorney
general considcred all the great original sin
of this conspiracy and treason to have origi-
nated with the societies in London—that the
country societies were only tools in their
hands, and that the Edinburgh convention
was the commencement of their projects ;
and yet it plainly appears that this convention
originated from neither of the London societies,
but had its beginning at Edinburgh, where,
just before, a convention had been sitting for
the reform in parliament, attended by the
principal persons in Scotland; and surely,
without qirerting to the nationality so pe-
culiar to the people of that country, it is not
at all suspicious, that, since they were to
hold a meeting for similar objects, they should
make use of the same style for their associa-
tion; and that their deputies should be called
delegates, when delegates had attended the
other convention from all the counties, and
whom they were every day looking at in their
streets, in the course of the very same year
that Skirving wrote his letter on the subject.
The views of the Corresponding Society, as

‘


they regarded this convention, and conse-
quently the views of the prisoner, must be
collected from the written instructions to the
delegates, unless they can be falsified by
matter which is collateral.—If I constitute an
agent, I am bound by what he does, tut
ways with this limitation, for what he does
within the scope of his agency :—If I constitute
an agent to buy horses for me, and he com-
mits high treason, it will not, I hope, be
argued that Tam to be hanged.—If I consti-
tute an agent for any business that can be
stated, and he goes beyond his instructions,
he must answer for himself beyond their B-
mits; for beyond them he is not my repre-
sentative.—The acts done, therefore, at the
Scotch convention, whatever may be their
quality, are evidence to show, that, in point
of fact, a certain number of people got to-
ether, and did any thing you choose to call
illegal; but, as far as it concerns me, if I am
Dot present, you are limited by my instructions
and have not advanced a single step upon
your journey to convict me: the instructions
to Skirving have been read, and speak for
themselves; they are strictly legal, and pur-
sue the avowed object of the society; and it
will be for the solicitor general to point oat,
in his reply, any counter or secret instruc-
tions, or any collateral conduct, contradictory
of the good faith with which they were
written. ‘he instructions are in these words
=~“ The delegates are instructed, on the part
of this society, to assist in bringing forward
and supporting any constitutional measure for
procuring a real representation of the Com-
mons of Great Britain.” What do you say,
gentlemen, to this language ?—how are men
to sa por themselves who desire a constito-
tional reform? The object and the mode of
effecting it were equally legal—this is most
obvious from the conduct of the parliament
of Ireland, acting under directions from Eng-
land; they passed the convention bill, and
made it only a misdemeanor, knowing that,
by the law as it stood, it was no misdemeanor
at all—Whether this statement may meet
with the approbation of others, I care not; I
know the fact to be so, and I maintain that
you cannot prove upon the convention which
met at Edinburgh, and which is c' to-
day with high treason, one tho th part

would be inevitable destruction :—yet in

pee that the prisoners were parties to it.—
is course of proceeding had been sanctioned
by the opinions of the judges upon other trials,
but the adoption of it upon. this occasion,
however legal, undoubtedly exposed the. pri-
soners to great peril of prejudgment, because
almost the whole of the evidence given by
the crown against them had been valected by
both Houses of Parliament just before the
‘trial, and printed by their authority; and a
statute ae Geo. 3, c. 54.] had even been
passed, declaring that the treacherous conspi-
racy which constituted the first and very im-
Portant branch of the evidence, did in fact
exist within the kingdom.—We say a very
important branch of the evidence, because
undoubtedly, if the jury had considered that
the evidence supported the truth of the pre-
amble to the act of parliament, the prisoners
must have been in a manner without # de-
fence. Authority was also given to detain,
without bail, persons already in custody, on
suspicion of being engaged in the above con-
spiracy, or who should be thereafter commit-

|, on that account.
_ “With regard to this act of parliament, it
is impossible, on the one hand, to deny the
constitutional competency of parliament to de-
clare the existence of a dangerous and ex-
tended conspiracy, endangering not only the
safety, but the very existence of the state—
On the other hand, the persons who may be-
come obnoxious to suspicion, and be subjected
to public prosecution in consequence of such
a legislative proceeding, come to a trial un-
der seemingly insurmountable disadvantages.

In the very case before us, the two Houses
of Parliament had collected and arranged the
greater part of the written evidence afterwards
produced by the crown against the prisoners,
and in the preamble of the act had given it
the character of a detestable conspiracy, to
subvert the monarchy, although, as has been
alreaiy stated, the inquiry of the jury was to
be divided into two branches—First, whether

any man seriously believe, that this meeting
at Edinburgh meant to assume and to main-
tain by force all the functions and authorities
of the state ?—Is the thing within the compass
of human belief?—If a man were offered 2

lished, substantiated the declaration made
in the preamble of the bill, of the existence
of such a canesicacy to subvert the govern-
ment: and secondly, whether the prisoners
had any and what share in it.—Now it is
most obvious, that if, in deference to the judg-
ment of parliament, the first part of this divr
sion had been found by the jury, and the law
of high on, as stated by the counsel for
the crown, had been adopted, the prisoners
could scarcely have had any defence, as
they then must have been taken, upon the
whole of the evidence, to have been privy to
proceedings throughout the whole kingdom,
directed to the subversion of the monarchy,
and destruction of the king. —_

“ All that can be said upon such a case is,
first, that dependence must be had upon the
sacred trust of the legislature, not without w-
gent necessity to adopt such a proceeding;
and carefully to consider the fair result of the
evidence, when made the foundation of ao
act of parliament: and secondly, that the
British constitution provides for the safety of
all who have the happiness to live under its
protection, by giving to twelve men, to be
taken from the mass of the people, the privi-
lege and the duty to sit in judgment upon all
that the authority of parliament may have de-
cided to be the fact, and all that the learning
of the Judges may consider to be the applica
cation of the law.

“Tn that respect, whatever may be the
merits of this case, and whatever amidst the
variety cous ests in a free country, may
be the prevailing opinion concerning it, the
trial by jury must ever be dear to Englishmen.

encouragement to whatever spirit of sedition
might have existed at that period, produced
an universal spirit of content and confidence
in the people. Nothing indecd could more

morable a proof of safety under the laws."—
Subject of the trial of Thomas Hardy, Ers-



parliament; and who, to maintain the club,
or whatever you choose to call it, collected a
little money frony people who were well dis-
posed to the cause ; a few shillings one day,
and perhaps as many pence another?—I think
as far as 1 could reckon it up, when the report
from this great committee of supply was read
to you, I counted that there had been raised,
in the first session of this parliament, fifteen
pounds, frum which indeed you must deduct two

bad shillings, which are literally noticed in the !

account.—ts it to be endured, gentlemen, that
men should gravely say, that this body as-
sumed to itself the offices of parliament ?—
that a few harmless people, who sat, as they
profess, to obtain a full representation of the
people, were themselves, even in their own
Imaginations, the complete representation
which they sought for ?—Why should they sit
from day to day to consider how they might
obtain what they had already got?—If their
object was an universal representation of the
whole people, how is it credible they could
pepport that universal representation to exist
in themselves—in the representatives of a few
societies instituted to obtain it for the country
at large ?—If they were themselves the na-
tion, why should the language of every reso-
lution be, that reason ought to be their grand
engine for the accomplishment of their object,
and should be directed to convince the nation
to speak to parliament in a voice that must be
heard? The proposition, there‘ore, is too
to cram down the throats of the Eng-

ish people, and this is the prisoner’s security.

free administration of justice : this proposition
on which so much depends, is not to be

Gentlemen, the very work of Mr. Paine,
under the banners of which this supposed re-
bellion was set on foot, refutes the charge it

is brought forward to support: for Mr. Paine, |

in his preface, and throughout his whole book,
Teprobates the use of torce against the most
evil governments; the contrary was never
imputed to him.—If his book had becn written
in pursuance of the design of force and rebel-
in, with which it is now sought to be con-
nected, he would, like the prisoners, have been
charged with an overt act of high treason; but
such a proceeding was never thought of.—
Mr. Pairie was indicted for a misdemeanor, *
and the misdemeanor was argued to consist
not in the falsehood that a nation has no
right to choose or alter its government, but in
. seditiously exciting the nation, without cause,

22, p. 357. org, :


fo exercise that right.—A learned lord (lord
chief baron Macdonald), now on this bench,
addressed the jury as attorney-general upon
this principle: his language was this:—The
question is not, what the people have a right
todo, for the people are, undoubtedly, the
foundation and origin of all government ; but
the charge is, for seditiously calling upon the
people, without cause or reason, to exercise a
right which would be sedition, supposing the
right to be in them: for though the people
might have a right to do the thing suggested,
and though they are not excited to the doing
it by force and rebellion, yet, as the sugges-
tion goes to unsettle the state, the propaga-
tion of such doctrines is seditious. There is

| No other way, undoubtedly, of describing that

charge. Iam not here entering into the ap-
plication of it to Mr. Paine, whose counsel I
was, and who has been tried already. ‘To say
that the people have a right to change their
perenne is indeed a truism; every body
nows it, and they exercised the right, other-
wise the king could not have had his establish-
ment amongst us, If, therefore, I stir up in-
dividuals to oppose by force the general will,
seated in the government, it may be treason;
but to induce changes in a government, by
exposing toa whole nation its errors and im-
perfections,can have no bearing upon such an
offence :—the utmost which can be made of
it is a misdemeanor, and that too depending
wholly upon the judgment which the jury may
form of the intention of the writer---The
Courts, for a long time, indeed, assumed to
themselves the province of deciding upon this
intention, as a matter of law, conclusively in-
ferring it from the act of publication: * I say
the Courts assumed it, though it was not the
doctrine of lord Mansfield, but handed down
to him from the precedents of judges before
his time: but even in that case, though the
publication was the crime, not, as in this case
the intention, and though the quality of the
thing charged, when not rebutted by evidence '
for the detendant, had so long been considered
to be a legal inference, yet the legislature, to
support the province of the jury, and in ten-
derness for liberty, has lately altered the law
upon this important subject. If, therefore, we
were not assembled, as we are, to consider of
the existence of high treason against the
king’s life, but only of a misdemeanor for se-
ditiously disturbing his title and establishment,
by the proceedings for a reform in parlia-
ment, I should think the Crown, upon the
very principle which, under the libel law,
must now govern such a trial, quite as distant
from its mark ; because, in my opinion, there
is no way by which his majesty’s title can more
firmly be secured, or by which (above all, in
our times) its permanency can be better esta-
blished, than by promoting a more full and
equal representation of the people, by peace-

able means; and by what other means has it
_been sought, in this instance, to be promoted ?
Gentlemen, when the members of this con-
vention were seized, did they attempt resist-
ance ?—Did they insist upon their privileges
as subjects under the laws, or as a parliament
enacting laws for others?---If they had said
or done any thing to give colour to such an
idea, there needed no spies to convict them ;
the crown could have given ample indemnity
for evidence from amongst themselves; the
societies consisted of thousands and thousands
of persons, some of whom, upon any calcula-
tion of human nature, might have been pro-
duced: the delegates, who attended the
meetings, could not be supposed to have met,
with adifferent intention from those who sent
\ them; and, if the answer to that is, that the
constituents are involved in the guilt of their
representatives, we get back to the monstrous
position from whick I observed you before to
shrink back, with visible horror, when I stated
@ ; namely, the involving in the fate and con-
sequence of this single trial every man, who
corresponded with these societies, or who, as a
member of societies in any pertof the kingdom,
consented to the meeting which was assem-
bled, or which was in prospect :—but, I thank
God, I have nothing to fear from those hy-
dras, when I see before me such just and ho-
nourable men to hold the balance of justice.
Gentlemen, the dissolution of this parlia-
ment speaksas strong a language asits conduct
when sitting —How was it dissolved? When
the magistrates entered, Mr. Skirving was in
the chair, which he refused to leave :—he
considered and asserted his conduct to be
legal, and therefore informed the magistrate
be must ne his authority, — the itis;
persion might appear to be involuntary,
that the Subject, disturbed in his "Pealite,
might be entitled to his remedy.—The ma-
gistrate on this took Mr. Skirving by the
shoulder, who immediately obeyed ; the chair
‘was quitted ina moment, and this great parlia-
ment broke up. What was the effect of all this
poweeting at the time, when whatever be-
to it must have been best understood?
~—Were any of the parties indicted for high
treason?—Were they indicted even for a
breach of the peace in holding the Conven-
tion ?—None of these things.—The law of
Scotland, arbitrary as it is, was to be dis-
turbed to find a name for their offence, and the
rules of trial to be violated to convict them:
—They were denied their challenges to their
Jurors, and other irregularities were. intro-
duced, 80 as to be the subject of complaint in
the House of Commons.— Gentlemen, in what
Tam saying, I am not standing up to vindi-
cate all that they published during these pro-
ings, more especially those which were
written in consequence of the trials I have
just alluded to; but allowance must be made
for a state of heat and irritation:—they saw
men whom they believed to be persecuted for
what they conceived to be innocent; they saw


them the victims of sentences which many
would consider as equivalent to, if not wore
than, judgment of treason: sentences which,
at all events had never existed before, and such
as, I believe, never will again with impunity.
—But since I am on the subject of iatertion,
I shall conduct myself with the same
moderation which I have been prescribing ; I
; will cast no aspersions, but shall content
myself with lamenting that these judg-
ments were productive of cons Dees,
which rarely follow from authority discreetly
exercised. How easy is it then to di: of
as much of the evidence as consu balfa
day in the anathemas against the Scotch
Judges! It appears that they came to variozs
resolutions concerning them: seme good,
some bad, and all of them irregular. Amongst
others they compare them to Jeffries, and
wish that they, who imitate his example, may
meet his fate.—What then? — Irreverend
expressions against Judges are not acts
of high treason!—If they had assembled
round the Court of Justiciary and hanged
them in the execution of their offices, it would
not have been treason within the statute—
I am no advocate for disrespect to J

.| and think that it is dangerous to the publi
order; but putting aside the insult upon the
Judges now in authority, the reprobation of
Jefiries is no libel, but an awful and useful
tie Jelion denied the’ privdege of Bogie

did light upon him; and when, after hus
| death, which speedily followed this transsc-
tion, the matter was brought before the House
of Commons, under that glorious Revolution
which is asserted throughout the proceedings
before you, the judgment against Sir Thomas
Armstrong was dec! to be a murder under
colour of justice? Sir Robert Sawyer,{ the
Attorney General, was expelled the House of
Commons for his misdemeanour in



the writ of crror,—and the executors-of Jef-
feries were commanded to make compensa-
tion to the widow and the daughter of the
deceased. These are great monuments of
justice ;—and, although I by .no means ap-
prove of harsh expressions against authority,
which tend to weaken the holdings of society,
yet let us. not go beyond the mark in our
Testraints nor suppose that men are dan-
gerously disaffected to the government, be-
cause they feel a sort of pride and exultation
in events, which constitute the dignity and
glory of their country.

Gentlemen, this resentment against the
proceedings of the Courts in Scotland, was not
¢onfined to those who were the objects of
them ; it was not confined even to the friends
of a Reform in Parliament—a_ benevolent
public, in both parts of the island, joined
them in the complaint; and a gentleman of
great moderation, and a most inveterate
enemy to parliamentary reform, as thinking

. i¢ Dot an improvement of the government, but
nevertheless a lover of his country and its
insulted justice, made the convictions of the
delegates the subject of a public inquiry :—
¥ speak of my friend Mr. William Adam,*
who brought these judgments of the Scotch

ges before the House of Commons—ar-
raigned them as contrary to law, and proposed
to reverse them by the authority of Parlia-
ment.+ Let it not then be matter of wonder,
that these poor men, who were the immediate
victims of this injustice, and who saw their
brethren expelled from their cuuntry by an
unprecedented and questionable judgment,
should feel like men on the subject, and ex-
press themselves as they felt.

Gentlemen, amidst the various distresses
and embarrassments which attend my present
situation, it is a great consolation that I have
marked from the beginning, your vigilant
attention and your capacity to understand ; it
is, therefore, with the utmost
that [ask you a few plain questions, arismg
eut of the whole of these Scotch proceedings.
—In the first place, then, do you believe it to
be possible, that, if these men had really pro-
jected the Convention as a traitorous usurpa-
tion of the authorities of Parliament, they
would have invited the Friends of the People,
im Frith-street, to assist them, when they

knew that this Society was determined not to |

seek the reform of the constitution, but by
means that were constitutional, and from
whom they could neither hope for support nor
concealment of evil purposes?—I ask you

able Privy Council.

next, if their objects had been traitorous,
would they have given them, without disguise
or colour, to the public and to the government, .
in every common newspaper? and yet it is
so far from being a charge against them,
that they concealed their objects by hypocrisy
or guarded conduct, that I have been driven
to admit the justice of the complaint against
them, for unnecessary inflammation and e:
geration.— [ask you tarther,whether if the pro-
ceedings, thus published and exaggerated, had
eppeared to Government, who knew every
ing belonging to them, in the light they
represent them to you today, they could
possibly have slept over them with such com-
plete indifference and silence? For itis note
rious, that after this Convention had been
held at Edinburgh; after, in short, every
thing had been said, written, and transacted,
on which I am now commenting, and after
Mr. Paine’s book had been for above a year in
universal circulation,—ay, up to the very day
when Mr. Grey gave notice, in the House of
Commons, of the intention of the Friends of
the People for a reform in Parliament, there
was not even a single indictment on the file.
for a misdemeanor ; but, from that moment,
when it was seen that the cause was not beat
down or abandoned, the lamation made
its appearance, and all the proceedings that
followed had their birth.—I ask you, lastly,
Gentlemen, whether it be in human nature,
that a few unprotected men, conscious
in their own minds, that they had been
engaged and detected ina detestable rebellion
to cut off the king, to destroy the administra-
tion of justice, and to subvert the whole fabri¢
of the government, should turn round upon
their country, whose ruin they had projected,
and whuse most obvious justice attached on
them, complaining, forsooth, that their dele-
gates, taken by magistrates, in the very act of
high treason, had been harshly and illegally in-
terrupted in a meritorious proceeding? ‘The his-
| toryofmankinodnever furnished an instance, nor
ever will, of such extravagant, preposterous,
and unnatural conduct! No, no, Gentlemen ;
all their hot blood was owing to their firm
persuasion, dictated by conscious innocence,
that the conduct of their delegates had been
legal, and might be vindicated against the
magistrates who obstructed them:—in that
they might be mistaken ;—I am_ not arguing
that point at present: if they are hereafter
| indicted for a misdemeanor, and | am Counsel.
‘in that cause, I will then tell you what I
‘think of it:—sufficient for the day is the
| good or evil of it,—it is sufficient, for the
present one, that the legality or illegality
| of the business has no relation to the crime
that is imputed to the Prisoner.

The next matter that is alleged against the
authors of the Scotch Convention, and the
societies which supported it, is, their having
sent addresses of friendship to the conventiow
of France. These addresses are considered to
be a decisive proof of republican combination,

3 P 2


verging closely ih themselves upon an syvert
act of treason.—Gentlemen, if the dates of
these addresses are attended to, which come
no lower down than November 1792, we have
only to lament, that they are but the acts of
private subjects, and that they were not sanc-
tioned by the state itself—The French na-
tion, about that period, under their new con-
stitution, or under their new anarchy, call it
which you will, were nevertheless most anxi-
ously desirous of maintaining peace with this
country.—But the king was advised to with-
draw his ambassador from France, upon the
approaching catastrophe of its most unfortu-
nate prince ;—an event which, however to be
deplored, was no justifiable cause of offence
to Great Britain.-~France desired nothing
but the regeneration of her own government;
and if she mistook the road to her prosperity,
what was that to us?—But it was alleged
against her in parliament, that she had intro-
duced spies amongst us, and held correspon-
dence with disaffected persons, for the des-
truction of our constitution; this was the
charge of our minister, and it was, therefore,

_ held to be just and necessary, for the safety of

the country, to hold France at arm’s length,
and to avoid the very contagion of contact
with her at the risk of war.—But, gentlemen,
this charge against France was thought b
many, to be supported by no better proofs
than those against the prisoner.—In the pub-
lic correspondence of the ambassador from
the French king, and upon his death, as mi-
nister from the convention, with his majesty’s
sraapect of state, documents which lie upon
the table of the House of Commons, and
which may be made evidence in the cause,
the executive council repelled with indigna-
tion all the imputations, which to this very
hour are held out as the vindications of quar-
rel, “ If there be such persons in England,”
says monsieur Chauvelin—“ has not England
Jaws tu punish them ?—France disavows them
---such men are not Frenchmen.”~-The same
Correspondence conveys the most solemn as-
surances of friendship down to the very end
of the year 1792—a period subsequent to all
the er sa and addresses complained
of.—Whether these assurances were faithful
orotherwise,— whether it would have been pru-
dent to have depended on them or otherwise,—
whether the war was advisable or unadvis-
able,—are questions over which we have no
jurisdiction ;—I only desire to bring to your re-
collection, that a man may be a friend to the
rights of humanity and to the imprescriptible
rights of social man, which is now a term of
derision and contempt, that he may feel to the
very soul for a nation beset by the sword of
despots, and yet be a lover of his own country
and its constitution.

Gentlemen, the same celebrated person, of
whom I have had occasion to speak so fre-
quently, is the best and brightest illustration
of this truth. Mr. Burke, indeed, went a
grat a farther than requires to be pressed


into the present argument; for he maintain-
ed the cause of justice and of truth, a
all the perverted authority and rash violence
of his country, and expressed the feelings of
a christian and a patriot in the very heat of
the American war; boldly holding forth our
victories as defeats ; and our successes as Ca-
lamities and disgraces. “ It is not instantly,”
said Mr. Burke, “ that I can be brought to
rejoice, when I hear of the slaughter and eap-
tivity of long lists of those names which have
been familiar to my ears from my infancy,
and to rejoice that they have fallen under the
sword of strangers, whose barbarous appella-
tions I scarcely know how to 7 prone. The
lory acquired at the Waite Plains by colonel}
ille, has no charms for me; and I fairly
acknowledge, that I have not yet learned to
delight in finding Fort Kniphausen in the
heart of the British dominions.”* If this
had been said or written by Mr. Yorke at
Sheffield, or by any other member of these
societies, heated with wine at the Globe-ta-
vern, it would have been trumpeted forth as
decisive evidence of a rebellious spirit, re-
joicing in the downfall of his saints yet the
great author from whose writings I have bor-
rowed, approved himself to be the friend of
this nation at that calamitous crisis, and
it pleased God to open the understand of
our rulers, his wisdom might have averted the
storms that are now thickening around us,
We must not, therefore, be too severe in our
strictures upon the opinions and feelings of
men as they regard such mighty public ques
tions.—The interests of a nation may often be
one thing, and the interests of its government
another; but the interest of those who hold
government for the hour, is at all times different
rom either. At the time many of the Papers
before you were circulated on the subject of the
war with France, many of the best and wisest
men in this kingdom began to be driven by
our situation to these melancholy reflections ;
and thousands of persons, the most firmly
attached to the principles of our constitution,
and who never were members of any of these
societies, considered, and still consider, Great
Britain as the aggressor against France ;
considered, and still consider, that she had a
Tight to choose a government for herself, and
that it was contrary to the first principles of
justice, and, if possible, still more repugnant
to the genius of uur own free constitution, to
combine with despots for her destruction :
who knows but that the external pressure
upon France may have been the cause of that
unheard-of state of society which we coms
lain of ?~who knows, but that, driven as she
as been to exertions beyond the ordinary
vigour of a nation, it has not been the parent
of that unnatural and giant strength which
threatens the authors of it with perdition?



These are melancholy considerations, but
they may reasonably, and at all events, be
lawfully entertained —We owe obedience to
government in our actions, but surely our opi-
nions are free.

Gentlemen, pursuing the order of time, we
are arrived, at length, at the proposition to
hold another convention, which, with the sup-
posed support of it by force, are the only overt
acts of high treason charged upon this record.—
For, strange as it may appear, there is no
charge whatever before you of any one of
those acts or writings, the evidence of which
consumed so many daysin reading, and which
has already nearly consumed my strength in
only passing them in review before you.—If
every line and letter of all the writings I have

een commenting upon were admitted to be
traitorous machinations, and if the conven-
tion in Scotland was an open rebellion, it is
cenceded to be foreign to the presen purpose,
unless as such criminality in them might show
the views and objects of the persons engaged
in them :—on that principle only the Court
has over and over again decided the evidence
of them to be admissible; and on the same
feweipie I have illustrated them in their or-

ler as they happened, that [ might lead the
prisoner in your view up to the very point and
moment when the treason is supposed to have
burst forth into the overt act for which he is
arraigned before you.

The transaction respecting this second con-
vention, which constitutes the principal, or
more properly the only overt act in the indict-
ment, lies in the narrowest compass, and is
clouded with no ambiguity.—I admit freely
evey act which is imputed to the prisoner,
and listen not so much with fear as with cu-
riosity and wonder, to the treason sought to
be connected with it. .

You will recollect that the first motion to-
wards the holding of a second convention,
eriginated in a letter to the prisoner from a
country correspondent, in which the legality
of the former was vindicated, and its disper-
sion lamented :—this letter was answered on
the 27th of March 1794, and was read to you
in the crown’s evidence in these words:

° “ March 27, 1794.

« Citizen ;—I am directed by the London
Corresponding Society to transmit the follow-
ing Resolutions to the Society for Constitu-
tional Information, and to request the senti-
ments of that society respecting the impor-
tant measures which the present juncture of
affairs seems to require.

“ The London Corresponding Society con-
ceives that the moment is arrived, when a full
and explicit declaration is necessary from all
the friends of freedom—whether the late il-
legal and unheard-of prosecutions and sentences
shall determine us to abandon our cause, or
shall excite us to pursue a radical reform,

with an ardour proportioned to the magnitude

ef the object, and with a zeal as distinguished


on our parts as the treachery of others in the
same ious cause is notorious. The Society
for Constitutional Information is therefore
required to determine whether or no they
will be ready, when called upon, to act in
conjunction with this and other societies to ob-
tain a fair representation of the PEOPLE—
whether they concur with us in seeing the ne-
cessity of a speedy convention, for the purpose
of obtaining, in a constitutional apd legal me-
thod, a redress of those grieoances: under which
we at present labour, and which can only be
effectually removed by a full and fair repre-
sentation of, the people of Great Britain. The
London Corresponding Society cannot but re-
mind their friends that the present crisis de-
mands all the prudence, unanimity, and vi-
gour, that may or can be exerted by MEN
and Britons; nor do they duubt but that
manly firmness and consistency will finally,
and they believe shortly, terminate in the full
accomplishment of all their wishes.—I am,
fellow citizen my humble measure), 3
friend to the rights of man.
(Signed) “ T. Harpy, Secretary.”

They then resolve that there is no securit
for the continuance of any right but in equal-
ity of daws ; not in equality of property, the
ridiculous bugbear by which you are to be
frightened into injustice ;—on the contrary
throughout aver part of the proceedings, an
most emphatically in Mr. Yorke’s speech, so
much relied on, the bencficial subordinations
of society, the seourtly of property, and the
Prosperity of the landed and commercial in-
terests, are held forth as the very objects to
be attained by the reform in the representa-
tion which they sought for.

In examining this first moving towards a
second convention, the first thing to be consi-
dered is, what reason there is, from the letter
I have just read to you, or from any thing
that appears to have led to it, to suppose that
a different sort of convention was projected
from that which had been before assembled
and dispersed.—The letter says another Bri-
tish Convention ; and it describes the same
objects as the first—compare all the papers
for the calling this second convention with
those for assembling the first, and you will
find no difference, except that they mixed
with them extraneous and libellous matter,
arising obviously from the irritation produced
by the sailing of the transports with their bre-
thren condemned to exile. These papers
have already been considered, and separated,
as they ought to be, from the charge. .

I will now lay before you all the remaining
operations of this formidable conspiracy up
to the prisoner’s imprisonment in the Tower.
Mr. Hardy having received the letter just
adverted to, regarding a second convention,
the Corresponding Society wrote the letter of
the 27th of March, and which was found in
his hand-writing, and is published in the first
Report, page 11. This,letter, enclosing the

Resolutions they
ject, was consi
Society on the next day, the 28th of March,
the ordinary day for their meeting, when they
sent an answer to the Corresponding Society,
informing them that they had received their
communication, that they heartily concurred
with them in the objects they had in view,
and invited them to send a delegation of their
members to confer with them on the subject.
Now, what were the objects they concurred
in, and what was to be the subject of conter-
ence between the societies by their delegates?
Look at the letter, which distinctly expresses
its objects, and the means by which they
sought to effect them:—had these poor men
(too numerous to meet all together, and there-
fore renewing the cause of Parliamentary
Reform by delegation trom the societies) any
reason to suppose, that they were involving
themselves in the pains of treason, and that
they were compassing the King’s death, when
they were redeeming (as they thought) his
authority from probable downfall and ruin?
Had treason been imputed to the delegates
before ?— Had the imagining the death of’ the
King ever been suspected by any body ?—Or
when they were prosecuted for misdemea-
nors, was the prosecution considered as an
indulgence conferred upon men whose lives
had been forfeited :—And is it to be endured,
then, in this free land, made free too by the
virtue of our forefathers, who placed the King
upon his throne to maintain this freedom,
that forty or fifty thousand people, in the
different parts of the kingdom, assembling in
their little societies to spread useful know-
ledge, and to ditfuse the principles of liberty,
which the more widely hey are spread, the
surer is the condition of our free government,
are iu a moment, without warning, without
any law or principle to warrant it, and with-
out precedent or example, to be branded as
traitors, and to be decimated as victims for
unishment!—-The Constitutional Society
aving answered the letter of the 27th of
March, in the manner [ stated to you;—
committees, from each of the two societies,
were appointed to confer together.—The
Constitutional Society appointed Mr. Joyce,
Mr. Kydd, Mr. Wardle, and Mr. Holcroft, all
indicted; and Mr. Sharpe, the celebrated
engraver, not indicted, but examined as a
witness by the Crown ;—five were appointed
by the Correspanding Society to meet these
entlemen, viz. Mr. Baxter, Mr. Moore, Mr.
Thelwall, and Mr. Hodgson, all indicted, aud
Mr. Lovett, against whom the bill was thrown
out. These gentlemen met at the house of
Mr. Thelwall on the 11th of April, and there
published the resolutions already commented
on, in conformity with the general objects of
the two societies, cxmresecdl in the letter of
the 27th of March, and agreed to continue to
meet on Mondays and Thursdays for farther
conference on the subject. The first Monday
was the 14th of April, of which we have

of April was the second Monday, but there
was still no meeting ; —the 24th of April was
the second Thursday when the five of the
Corresponding Suciety attended, but nobody
coming to meet them from the other, nuthing
of course was transacted;—on Monday, the

appointment, this blosdy and impatient band
of conspirators, secing that a Convention Bill
was in projection, and tbat Hessians were
landing on our coasts, at last assembled them.

action.—Gentlemen, they met ;—they shook
hands with each other ;—they talked over
the news and the pleasures of the day ;—
they wished one another a good evening, and
retired to their homes :—it is in vain to hide
it, they certainly did all these things —The
same alurming scene was repeated on the
three following days of meeting, and on Mon-
day, May the 12th, would, but for the vigilance
of Government, have probably again takea
place:—but on that day Mr. Hardy was
arrested, his papers seized, and the conspiracy
which pervaded this devoted country was
dragged into the face of day. ‘To be ald a
gentlemen, you have Literatry the whole
it before you in the meetings I have just
stated; in which you find ten gentlemen,
appointed by two peaceable sucieties, conyers-
ing upon the subject of a constitutional reform
in parliament, publishing the result of theig
deliberations, without any other arms than
one supper-knife ; which, when I come to the
subject of arms, I will, in form, lay before you.
—Yet for this, and for this alone, you are
asked to devote the prisoner before you, and
his unfortunate associates, to the pains and
penalties of death, and not to death alone, but
to the eternal stigma and infamy of having
conceived the detestable and horrible design
of dissolving the government of their country,
and of striking at the life of their Sovereign,
who had never given offence to them, nor te
any of his subjects. .
Gentlemen, as a conspiracy of this formid-
able extension, which had po less for its
object than the sudden annihilation of all the
existing authorities of the country, and of
every thing that supported them, could not be
even gravely stated to have an existence,
without contemplation of force to give it
effect; it was absolutely necessary to impreag
upon the public mind, and to establish, hy
formal evidence, upon the present occasion,
that such a force was actually in preparation,
—This most important and indispensable pert
of the cause was attended with insurmoun
able difficulties, not only from its being um
founded in fact, but because it had been ex-
pressly negatived by the whole conduct of
Government:—for although the motions of
all these societies had been watched for two
years together; though their spies had regu

larly attended, and collected regular journals
of their proceedings ; yet when the first Report
was finished, the Habeas Corpus Act
suspended upon the foundation of the facts
contained in it, there was not to be found,
from one end of itto the other, even the in-
sinuation of arms; I believe that this circum-
stance made a great impression upon all the
thinking dispassionate part of the public, and
that the materials of the first Report were
thought to furnish but a slender argument to
support such a total eclipse of liberty. No
wonder, then, that the discovery of a pike in
the interval hetween the two Reports, should
have been highly estimated—I mean no re-
flections upon Government, and only state the
matter, as a man of great wit very publicly
reported it;—he said that the discoverer,
when he first bebeld the long-looked-for
pike, was transported beyond himself with
enthusiasm and delight, and that he hung
over the rusty instrument with all the raptures
of 2 fond mother, who embraces her first-born
infant, “ and thanks her God for all her travail
past.”

Tn consequence of this discovery, whoever
might have the merit of it, and whatever the
discoverer might have felt upon it, persons
were sent by Government (and properly sent)
into all corners of the kingdom to investi-
gate the extent of the mischief; the fruit of
this inquiry has been laid before you, and I
pledge myself to sum up the evidence which
you have had upon the subject, not by parts,
or. by general observations, but in the same
manner as the Court itself must sum it up tu
you, when it lays the whole body of the proof
with fidelity before you.—Notwithstandin:
all the declamations upon French anarchy, {
think I may safely assert, that it has ieee
distinctly proved, by the evidence, that the
Sheffield people were for universal represen-
tation in a British House of Commons. This
appears to have been the general sentiment,
with the exception of one witness, whosoe
testimony makes the truth and bona fides of
the sentiments far more striking ; the witness
Tallude to (George Widdison), whose evidence
1 shall state in its place, seems to bea plain,
blunt, honest man, and by-the-by, which
must never be forgotten of any of them, the
Crown’s witness —I am not interested in the
veracity of any of them, for (as I have fre-
quently adverted to) the Crown must take
them for better for worse ;—it must support
each witness, and the whole body of its evi-
dence throughout.—If you do not believe the
whole of what is proved by a witness, what
confidence can you have.in part of it, or what
Part can you select to confide in ?—If you are
deceived in t,-who shall measure the
boundaries of the deception?—This man says
he was at first for universal suffrage; Mr.
Yorke had persuaded him, from all the books,
that it was the best; but that be afterwards
saw reason to think otherwise, and was not
tor going the length of the Duke of Richmond:


but that all the other Sheffield people were
for the Duke’s plan; a fact soniye by the
cross-examination of every one of the wit-
nesses.—You have, therefore, positively and
distinctly, upon the universal authority of the
evidence of the Crown, the people of Sheffield,
who are charged as at the head of a republi-
can conspiracy, proved to be associated on
the very principles which, at different times,
have distinguished the most eminent persons
in this kingdom; and the charge made upon
them, with regard to arms, is cleared up by
the same universal testimony.

You recollect that, at a meeting held upon
the Castle-hill, there were two parties in the
country, and itis material to attend to what,
these two parties were.—In consequence of
the King's proclamation, a great number of
honourable, zealous persons, who had been
led by a thousand artifices to believe, that
there was a just cause of alarm in the country,
took very extraordinary steps for support of
the magistracy.—The publicans were directed
not to entertain persons who were friendly.
to a reform of Parliament; and alarms of
change and revolution pervaded the country,
which became greater and greater, as our ears
were hourly assailed with the successive cala-
mities of France.—Others saw things in an
opposite light, and considered that these calax
mities were made the pretext for extinguish-
ing British liberty ;—heart-burnings arose
between the two parties; and some, I am
afraid a great many, wickedly or ignorantly
interposed in a quarrel which zeal had begun.
—The societies were disturbed in their meet-
ings, and even the private dwellings of many
of their members were illegally violated.—It
appears by the very evidence for the Crown,
by which the cause must stand or fall, that
many of the friends of reform were daily in-
sulted,—their houses threatened to be pulled
down, and their peaceable meetings beset by
pretended magistrates, without the process of
the law.—These proceedings naturally sug-

sted the propriety of having arms for self-
Helence, the first and most unquestionable
privilege of man, in or out of society, and ex-
pressly provided for by the very letter of
English law.—It was ingeniously put by the
learned Counsel, in the examination ef a
witness, that it was complained of amongst
them, that very little was sufficient to obtuin
a warrant from some magistrates, and that
therefore it was as well to be provided for
those who might have warrants as for those
who had none. Gentlemen, I am too much
exhausted to pursue or argue such u difference,
even if it existed upon the evidence, because
if the societies in question (however mista-
kenly) considered their mectings to be legal,
and the warrants to disturb them to be beyond
the authority of the magistrate to grant, they
had a right, at the peril of the legal conse-
quenees, to stand upon their defence; and it
is no tranegression of the law, much less high
treason against the King, to resist his officers

when they Pa the bounds of their authority.
So much for the general evidence of arms;
and the first and last time that even the name
of the prisoner is connected with the subject,
is by aletter he received from a person of the
name of Davison. I am anxious that this
part of the case should be distinctly under-
stood, and I will, therefore, bring back this
letter to your attention’; the letter is as follows:

“Fe itow-cit1zEN; —The barefaced aristo-
cracy of the present administration has made
it necessary that we should be prepared to act
on the defensive, against any attack they may
command their newly armed minions to make
uponus. A plan has been hit upon, and, if
encouraged sufficiently, will, no doubt, have
the effect of furnishing a gaan of pikes to
the patriots, great enough to make them for-
midable. The blades are made of steel, tem-

red and polished after an approved form.
hey may be fixed into any shafts ae Sir
ones are recommended) of the girt of the ac-
companying hoops at the top end, and about
an inch more at the bottom.

“The blades and hoops (more than which
cannot properly be sent to any great distance)
will be charged one shilling. Money to be
sent with the orders.

« As the institution is in its infancy, imme-
diate encouragement is necessary.

“ Orders may be sent to the Secretary of the
Sheffield Constitutional Society. [Struck out.]

“ Ricgarp Davison.

« Sheffield, April 24th, 1794.”

Gentlemen, you must recollect (for if it
should escape you, it might make a great dif.
ference) that Davison directs the answer to
this letter to be sent to Robert Moody at
Sheffield, to prevent post-office suspicion ;
and that he also encloses in it a similar one,
which Mr. Hardy was to forward to Norwich,
in order that the society at that place might
provide pikes for themselves, in the same

‘ manner that Davison was recommending,
through Hardy, to the ple of London.
Now what followed upon the prisoner’s receiv-
ing this letter?—It is in evidence, by this
very Moody, to whom the answer was to be
sent, and who was examined as a witness by
the crown, that he never received any answer
tothe letter ; and, although there was an uni-

seizure of papers, no such letter, nor
any other, appeared to have been written;
and, what is more, the letter to Norwich,
from Davison, enclosed in his letter to Hardy,
was never forwarded, but was found in his
custody when he was arrested, three weeks
afterwards, folded up in the other, and un-
opened, as he received it---Good God! what
is become of the humane sanc of Eng-
lish | eae is the sense meanin
of the term proveably in the statute of kin,
Edward, if such evidence can be receiv:
penne an English subject, on a trial for his
life?--If a man writes a letter to me about
pikes, or about any thing else, can I help it?


(956

—And is it evidence (except to acquit me of
suspicion) when it appears that nothing is
done upon it? Mr, Hardy never before cor-
responded with Davison---he never desired him
to write to him.—How indeed could he de-
sire him when his very existence was unknown
to him?—~He never returned an answer;—
he never forwarded the enclosed to Norwich;
—he never even communicated the letter it-
self to his own society, although he was its
secretary, which showed he considered it as
the unauthorized, officious co! dence of
a private man ;—he never upon it st
all, nor appears to have regarded it as danger-
ous or important, since he neither

nor concealed it. Gentlemen, I declare I
hardly know in what language to e: my
astonishment, that the crown can ask you
shed the blood of the man at the bar upea
such foundations.—Yet this is the whole of
the written evidence concerning arms: forthe
remainder of the plot rests, for its foundation,
upon the parole evidence, the whole of which
I shall pursue with precision, and not suffer 3
link of the chain to pass unexamined.

ili: was the first_ witness: he
swore that the Sheffield societies were fre
quently insulted, and threatened to be diy
persed ; so that the people in peneral oa
it necessary to defend themselves against ile
gal attacks :—that the justices having offi:
ously intruded themselves into their
able and legal meetings, they thought they
had a right to: be armed; but they did not
claim this right under the law of nature, ot by
theories of government, but as Enciiss svs-
sects, under the government of Encraxp;
for they say in their paper, which has been
read by the crown that would condemn them,
that they were entitled by the Brix or Ricats
to be’ armed. Gentlemen, they state their
title truly.._The preamble of that statute ena-
merates the offences of king James 2d;
amongst the chief of which was, his causing
his subjects to be disarmed, and then our aD-
cestors claim this violated right as their inde
feasible inheritance.—Let us therefore be ca
tious ast we rush to the one _
men are plotting treason against the king, |
cause they are asserting a right, the en
of which has been adjudged against a kingto
be treason against the people ; and let ustot
suppose that English subjects are a bandit,
for preparing to defend their legal liberties with
pikes, because pikes may have been accideo-
tally employed in another country to destroy
both liberty and law.—Camage says he was
spoken to by this Davison about three
of pikes—What then?---He is raz Csows’s
WITNESS, WHOM THEY OFFER TO YOU AS THE
WITNESS OF TRUTH, and he started with hort
at the idea of violence, and spoke with visible
reverence for the king; saying, God fortid
that he should touch him ; but he, neverthe
less, had a pike for himself. Indeed, be
manliness with which he avowed it, gave

is evidence —“ No

additional strength to his e


doubt.” says he, “I had a pike, but I would
not have remained an hour a member of the
society, if I had heard a syllable, that it was
in the contemplation of any body to employ
pikes or any other arms against the king or
the government.—We meant to petition par-
liament, through the means of the convention
of Edinburgh, thinking that the House of
Commons would listen to this expression of
the general sentiments of the people; for it
bad been thrown out, he said, in parliament,
that the people did not desire it themselves.”
Mr. Broonthead, whose evidence I have al-
ready commented upvon, a sedate, plain, sensi-
ble man, spoke also of his affection to the
government, and of the insults and threats
which had been offered to the people of Shef-
field: he says, “ I heard of arms on the Cas-
tle-hill, but it is fit this should be distinctly
explained: a wicked hand-bill, to provoke
and terrify the multitude, had been thrown
about the town in the night, which caused
agitation in the minds of the people; and it
was then spoken of, as being the right of every
individual, to have arms for defence ; but there
was no idea ever started of resisting, much
Jess of attaching, the government. I never
heard of such athing. I fear God,” said the
witness, “ and honour the king; and would
Not have consented to send a delegate to
Edinburgh, but for peaceable and legal pur-

The next evidence, upon the sybject of
arms, is what is proved by Widdison, to which

beg your particular attention, because, if
there be any reliance upon his testimony, it
puts an endto every criminal imputation upon
Davison, through whom, in the strange man-
neralready observed upon, Hardy could alone
be criminated.

This man, Widdison, who was both a tur-
ner and hair-dresser, and who dressed Davi-
son's hair, and was his most intimate acquain-
tance, gives you an account of their most con-
fidential conversations upon the subject of the
pikes, when it is impossible that they could

imposing upon one another; and he de-
cares, upon his solemn oath, that Davison,
without even the knowledge or authority of
the Sheffield Society, thinking that the same
insults might be offered to the London Socie-
tics, wrote the letter to Hardy, of his own head,
as the witness expressed it, and that he, Widdi-
son, made the pike-shafts, to the number of
a dozen and a halt.—Davison, he said, was
his customer ; he told him that people began
to think themselves in danger, and he there-
fore made the handles of the pikes for sale,
to the number of a dozen and a half, and one
likewise for himself, without conceiving that
he offended against any law. “I love the
King,” said Widdison, “as much as any man,
and all the people I associated with did the
same; I would not have stayed with them if
they had not :—Mr. Yorke often told me pri-
vately, that he was for universal representa-
Uon, and so were we all—THE DUKE oF RicH-
MOND’S PLAN WAS OUR ONLY OBJECT.”


This was the witness who was shown the
duke’s letter, and spoke to it as being cir-
culated, and as the very creed of the societies.
—This evidence shows, beyond all doubt, the
genuine sentiments of these people, because
It consists of their most confidential commu-
nications with one another ; and the only an-
swer, therefore, that can possibly be given to
it is, that the witnesses, who deliver it, are.
imposing upon the Court —But this (as I have
wearied you with reiterating) the crown can-
not say: for, in that case, their whole proof
falls to the ground together, since it is only
from the same witnesses that the very exist-
ence of these pikes and their handles comes
before us; and, if you suspect their evi-
dence in part, for the reasons already given, it
must be in toto rejected.—My friend is so *
good as to furnish me with this farther obser-
vation, that Widdison said he had often.
heard those who called themselves aristocrats
say, that if an invasion of the country should”
take place, they would begin with destroying
their enemies at home, that they might be
unanimous inthe defence of their country. —

John Hill was next called: he is a cutler,.
and was employed by Davison to make the’
blades for the pikes; he saw the letter which
was sent to Hardy, and knew that it was sent
lest there should be the same call for defence
in London against illegal attacks upon the
societies ; for that at Sheffield they were daily
insulted, and that the opposite party came
to his own house, fired muskets under the
door, and threatened to pull it down; he
swears that they were, to a man, faithful to
the king, and that the reform proposed was in
the Commons House of Parliament.

John Edwards was called, farther to con-
nect the prisoner with this combination of
force: but so far from establishing it, he swore,
upon his cross-examination, that his only
reason for going to Hardy’s was, that he
wanted a ike for his own defence, without
connexion with Davison, or with Sheffield, and
without concert or correspondence with any
body. He had heard, he said, of the vio-
lences at Sheffield, and of the pikes that had
been made there for defence ; that Hardy, on
his application, showed him the letter which,
as has appeared, he never showed to any other
person.—This is the whole sum and sub-
stance of the evidence which applies to the
charge of pikes, after the closest investigation,
under the sanction, and by the aid of parlia-
ment itself; evidence which, s0 far from estay
blishing the fact, would have been a satisfac-
tory answer to almost any testimony b’
which such a fact could have been supported :
for in this unparalleled proceeding, the pri-
soner’s counsel is driven by his duty to dwell
upon the detail of the crown’s proofs; be-
cause the whole body ofit is the completest
answer to the indictment which even a free
choice itself could have selected.—It is farther
worthy of your attention, that, as far as the evi-
dence proceeds from these plain, natural

sources, which the crown was driven te, for
the necessary foundation of the proceedings
before you, it has been simple,—uniform,—
natural, and consistent ; and that whenever a
different complexion was to be given to it, it
‘was only through the medium of spies and
informers, and of men, independently of their
infamous trade, of the most abandoned and
profligate characters.

Before I advertto what has been sworn by
this description of persons, I will give you a
wholesome caution concerning them, and,
having no eloquence of my own to enforce it,
I will give it to you in the language of the
same gentleman whose works are always
seasonable, when moral or political lessons
are to be rendered delightful. Look then at
the picture of society, as Mr. Burke has drawn
it, under the dominion of spies and informers:
I say under their dominson, for a resort to

ies may, on occasions, be justifiable, and
their evidence, when confirmed, may deserve
implicit credit: but I say under the dominion
of spies and informers, because the case of the
crown must stand alone upon their evidence,
gud wpon their evidence, not only unconfirm-
ed, but in direct contradiction to every witness,
not an informer or @ spy, and in a case too
where the truth, whatever it zs, lies within the
knowledge of forty or fifty thousand people.
Mr. Burke says—I believe I can remember it
without reference to the book.

“ A mercenary informer knows no distinc-
ton. Under such a system, the obnoxious
rere are slaves, not only to the goverament,

t they live at the mercy of every individual ;
they are at once the slaves of the whole com-
munity, and of every part of it; and the
worst and most unmerciful men are those on
whose goodness they most depend.

. “In this situation men not only shrink
from the frowns of a stern magistrate, but
are obliged to fly from their very species. The
seeds of destruction are sown in civil inter-
course and in social habitudes.—The blood
of wholesome kindred is infected.—The tables
and beds are surrounded with snares. All
the means given by Providence to make life
safe and comfortable, are perverted into instru-
ments of terror and torment.—This species of
universal subserviency that makes the very
servant who waits behind your chair, the ar-
biter of your life and fortune, has such a ten-
@ency to degrade and abase mankind, and to
deprive them of that assured and liberal state
ef mind which alone can make us what we
ought to be, that I vow to God, I would
sooner bring myself to put a man to immedi-
ate death for opinions I disliked, and so to get
rid of the nan and his opinions at once, than
to frethim witha feverish being, tainted with
the gaol distemper of a contagious servitude,
te keep him above ground, an animated mass
of putrefaction, corrupted himself, and cor-
voptimg all about him.”

_ Gentlemen, let me bring to your recollec-
tion the deportment of the first of this tribe,


Mr. Alexander,—who could not in halfan
hour even tell where he had lived, or why be
had left his master—Does any man i
that he had forgotten these most recent trans-
actions of his life? Certainly not—but bis
history would have undone his credit, aod
must therefore be concealed.— He had lived
with a linen draper, whose address we could
scarcely get from him, and they had parted
because they had words:—What were the
words? We were not to be told that—He
then went to a Mr. Kellerby’s, who agreed
with him at twenty-five guineas a year.—Why
did he not stay there?—He was obliged, it
seems, to give up his lucrative agreement, be
cause he was obliged to attend here as a wit
ness.—Gentlemen, Mr. Kellerby lives only ia
Holborn, and was he obliged to give up a per
manent engagement with a tradesman ip
born, because he was obliged to be absent st
the Old Bailey for five minutes in one sia
day? I asked him ifhe had told Mr. White,
solicitor for the Treasury, who would not bave
been so cruel as to deprive a man of bis breed
by keeping him upon attendance which night
have been avoided by a particular notice.—
The thing spoke for itself—he had never tod
Mr. White: but had he ever told Mr. Ke-
lerby ? for how else could he know that his
place was inconsistent with his engagement
upon this trial? No, he had never told him!
—tHow then did he collect that his place was
inconsistent with hisduty here? This ques-
tion never received nal answer.—You a
how he dealt with it, and how he stood stam-
mering, not daring to lift ap his countenance
in any direction,—confused,—disconcerted,—
and confounded.

Driven from the accusation wpon the sub-
ject of pikes, and even from the very colour
of accusation, and knowing that nothing ¥as
to be done without the proof of arms, we
have got this miserable, solitary knife, held
up to us as the engine which was to destroy
the constitution of this country; and Mr.
Groves, an Old Bailey solicitor, employed 33
a spy upon the occasion, has been selected

ive probability to this monstrous absurdity,

yy his respectuble evidence.—I understs
that this same gentleman has carried his sv*
tem of spying to sucha pitch as to practic &
since this unfortunate man has beca standing
a prisoner before you, proffering himself, a 2
friend, to the committee preparing his defeore
that he might discover to the crown the me
terials by which he meant to defend his life.
—I state this only from report, and 1 hope
God I am mistaken ; for humen natare star's
back appalled from such atrocity, and shrinks
and trembles at the very statement of it—
But as to the pesiury of this miscreant, it will
appear palpable beyond all question, and he
shall answer for it in due seayen. He tell
you he attended at Chalk Farm; and that
there, forsooth, amongst about seven of e%

thousand pcople, he saw two or pe et
with knives :—he might, I should have

seen many more, 28 hardly any man goes
witbout a knife of some sort in his pocket.—
He asked, however, it seems, where they got
these knives, and was directed to Green, a
hair-dresser, who deals besides in cutlery;


they were enrolled under public articles ;—
and though Franklow himself, as appears
from the evidence, attended publicly at the
Globe tavern in his uniform, whilst the car-
touch boxes and the other accoutre.uents of

and accordingly this notable Mr. Groves went | these secret cunspiraters lay publicly upon

(as he told us) to Green’s, and asked to pur-
ebase a knife ; when Greenin answer to him
said, “ speak low, for my wife is a damn’d
aristocrat.”—This answer was sworn to by the
wretch, to give you the idea that Green, who
had the knives to sell, was conscious that he
kept them for an illegal and wicked purpose,
that they were not to be sold in public.
~~The door, he says, being a-jar, the man de+
sired him to speak low, from whence he would
have you understand that it was because this
aristocratic wife was within hearing.—This,
gentlemen, is the testimony of Groves, and
reen himself is called as the next witness ;
and called by whom? Not by me—I know
nothing of him, he is the crown’s own witness.
—He is called to confirm Grove’s evidence ;
but xot being a spy, he declared solemnly upon
his oath, and I can confirm his evidence by
several respectable people, that the knives in
question lie constantly, and lay then, in his
open shop-window, in what is called the show
where cutlers, like other tradesmen, ex-
es their ware to publ view; and that the
ives differ in nothing from others publicly
sold in the Strand, ant every other street in
London ;—that he bespoke them from a rider,
who came round for orders in the usual way ;

that he sold only fourteen in all, and that the:

were made up in little packets, one of whic
Mr. Hardy had, who was to choose one for
himself, but four more were found in bis pos-
session, because he was arrested before Green

had an opportunity of sending for them.
Gentlemen, I think the pikes and knives
ase now completely disposed of; butsomething
was said also about guns; let us, therefore,
see what that amounts to.—It appears that
Mr. Hardy was applied to by Samuel Wil-
liams, a gun-engraver, who was not even a
member of any society, and who asked him
if he knew any body who wanted a gun—
Hardy said he did not; and undoubtedly upon
the crown’s own showing, it must be taken
for granted that if at that time he had been
sega! with any planof arming, he would
ave given a different answer, and would
have jumped at the offer :—about a fortnight
ards, however (Hardy in the interval
having become acquainted with Franklow),
Wiliams called to buy a pair of shoes, and
then Hurdy, recollecting his former application
referred him to Franklow, who had in the
most public manuer raised the forty men, who
were called the Loyal Lambeth Association :—
so that, in order to give this transaction any
bearing upon the charge, it became necessary
to consicer Franklow’s associationas an armed
comepiracy against the government ;—though
the forty people who composed it were col-
by public advertisement ;—though

his shop-board, exposed to the open view of
all his customers and neighbours. This story,
therefore, is not less contemptible than that
which you ‘must have all heard concerning
Mr. Walker, * whom 1 went to detend at
Lancaster, where that respectable gentleman
was brought.to trial upon such @ trumped-up
charge, supported by the solitary evidence of
one Dunn, a most infamous witness: but
what was the end of that prosecution ?—I ree
collect it to the boneur of my friend, Mr.
Law, who conducted it for the crewn, who,
knowing that there were persons whose pas-
sions were agitated upon these subjects at
that moment, and that many persons had en-
rolled themselves in societies to resist conspi-~
racies against the government, behaved in a
Most manly and honourable manner, ina
manner, indeed, which the public ought te
know, and which I hope it never will forget :
he would not even put me upon my challenges
to such persons, but withdrew them from the
panel ; and when he saw the complexion of
the affair, from the contradiction of the infa~
mous witness whose testimony supported it,
he honourably gave up the cause.
Gentlemen, the evidence of Lynam does
not require the same contradiction which fell
upon Me. Groves, because it destroys itself by
its own intrinsic inconsistency ;—I could not,
indeed, if it were to save my life, undertake to
state it to you.—It lasted, I think, about six
or seven hours, but I have marked under
different parts of it, passages so grossly con-
tradictory, matter so impossible, so inconsis-
tent with any course of conduct, that it will
be sufficient to bring these parts to your view,
to destroy all the rest. But let us first exa-
mine in what manner this matter, such as it
is, was recorded.—He professed to speak from
Notes, yet I observed him frequently looking
up to the ceiling whilst he was speaking ;—
when I said to him, Are you now speaking
from a note? Have you got any note of what
you are now saying? he answered; Ob no,
this is from  recullection—Good God Al-
mighty! recollection mixing itself with notes
in a case of high treason :—He did not even
take down the words —nay. to do the magn
i justice, he did not even affect to have taken
the words, but only the substance, as he him-
self expressed it—O EXCELLENT EVIDENCE !—~
THE SUBSTANCE OF WORDS TAKEN DOWN BY &
SPY, AND SUPPLIED, WHEN DEFECTIVE, BY HIS

* cotd for the business of the society, and cor- | to expect that a great city might be drownel

rect to dissolve and to punish it !—What after
all do the notes amount'to? I will advert to
the parts I alluded to—they were, it seems,
to go to Frith-street, to sign the Declaration
of the Friends of the Liberty of the Press,
which lay. there already signed by between
twenty and thirty members of the House of
Commons, and many other respectable and
opulent men, and then they were to begin
civil confasion, and the king’s head and Mr.
Pitt's were to be placed on Temple- bar.—Im-
mediately after whieh we find them resolving
unanimously to thank Mr. Wharton: for his
speech to support the glorious Revolution of
1688, which supports the very throne that
was to be destroyed! which same speech
they were to circulate in thousands for the
use of the societies throughout the kingdom.
~—Such incoherent, impossible matter, pro-
ceeding from such a source, is unworthy of all
farther concern. 5
Thus driven out of every thing which re
lates to arms, and from every other matter
which can possibly attach upon life, they
“have recourse to an expedient, which, I de-
clare, fills my mind with horror and terror: it
is this—The Corresponding Society had (you
recollect), two years before, sent delegates to
Scotland, with specific instructions, peaceably
: to pursue a parliamentary reform ;—when the
convention: which they were sent to was dis-
‘persed, they sent no others—for they were
_ arrested when only considering of the pro-
priety of another convention. It happened
‘that Mr. Hardy was the secretary during the
riod of these Scotch proceedings, and the
letters consequently written by tim, during
that period, were all official letters froma
-’ body circulated by him in pointofform. When
the proposition took place for calling a second
‘convention, Mr. Hardy continued to be se-
- cretary, and in that character, signed the cir-
: cular letter read in the evidence for the crown,
‘which sprees to have found its way, in the
‘course of circulation, into Scortanp. This
: single circumstance has been admitted as the
‘foundation of receiving in evidence against
the prisoner, a long transaction imputed to
one Watt,® at Edinburgh, whose very exist-
ence was unknown to Hardy.—This Watt
‘had been employed by government as a spy,
but at last caught a Tartar in his spyship;
for, in endeavouring to urge innocent men to
8 project, which never entered into their ima-
ginations, he was obliged to show himself
‘ready to do what he recommended to others ;
“and the tables being turned upon him, he
“was hanged by his employers. —This man
‘Watt read from a paper designs to be ac-
complished, but which he never intended to
attempt, and the success of which he knew
to be visionary.—To suppose that Great Bri-
tain could have been destreyed by such a |
rebel as Watt, would be, as Dr. Johnson says,

by the overflowing of its kennels. But what-
ever might be the peril of Watt’s conspiracy,
what had Hardy to do with it? The peopk
with Watt were five or six persons, w
unknown to Hardy, and not members of sny
society of which Mr. Hardy was a member;
I vow to God, therefore, that I cannot expres
what I feel, when I'am: obliged to state the
evidence by which he is zpuget to be affected.
—A letter, viz. the circular letter signed by
Hardy for calling another convention, &
shown to George Ross, who says he received
it fromr one Stock, who belonged to 2 society
which met in Nicholson-street, in Edinburg,
and that he sent it to Perth, Strathaves,
Paisley, and other places im Scotland; st

and it may be sufficient evidence for tht
purpose: I will not argue the case of a dead
man, and, above all, of such a man; bet!
will say, that too much money was spent upen
this performance, as I think it cost govem-
ment about fifty thousand pounds.— M‘Ewsa
says, that Watt read from a paper to 8 cea
mittee of six or seven people, of whith be,
the witness, was a member, that gentlemen,
residing in the country, were not to leave
their habitations, under pain of death; tht

reading this paper, and the other for not dis-

senting from it when it was read; and, with
regard to this last unfortunate person, the
crown thought it indecent, as-it would indeed
have been indecent and scandalous, to execute
the law upon him; as a gentleman upon his
jury said he would die, rather than convict
Downie without a recommendation of mercy,
and he was only brought over to join in the
werdict, under the idca that he would not be
executed, and accordingly he has not suffered
execution. If Downie, then, was an object
of mercy, or rather of justice, though he was
the very reom with Watt, and heard dis-

Acard of him,—to whose very being he was an
utter stranger ? .
Gentlemen, it is impossible for me to
know what impression this observation
makes upon you, or upon the Court; but I

acclare Iam deeply impressed with the ap-

plication of it—How is a man to defend him-
self against such implications of guilt? —
Which of us all would be safe, standing at
the bar of God or man, if he were even to

answer for all his own expressions, without
taking upon him the crimes or rashnesses of
others? This poor man has, indeed, none of

his own to answer for: yet how can he stand
safely in judgment before you, if, in a season
ofalarm and agitation, with the whole pressure
of government upon him, your minds are to be
distracted with criminatiag materials brought
from so many quarters, and of an extent
which mocks all power of discrimination ?—
.I am conscious that I have not adverted to
the thousandth part of them; yet I am sink-
ing under fatigue and weakness.—-I am st
‘this moment scarcely able to stand up whilst
I am speaking to you, deprived as I have
“been, for nights together, of every thing that
.deserves the name of rest, repose, or comfort.
-—I, therefore, hasten, whilst yet I may be
“able, to remind you once again of the great
punciple into which all I have been saying
Sesolves itself,

Gentlemen, my whole argument then
amounts to no more than this, that before
the crime of compassing THe KING's DEATR
can be found by you, the jury, whose provinte
it is to judge of its existence, it must be be-
lieved by you to have existed in point of ‘fact.
—Before you can adjudge a Fact, you must
believe it—not suspect it—or imagine it, or
fancy it,—BUT BELIEVE IT ;—and it is impos-
sible to impress the human mind with such
a reasonable and certain belief, as is neces-
sary to be impressed, before a christian man
can adjudge his neighbour to the smallest pe-
nalty, much less to the pains of death, with-
out having such evidence as a reasonable
mind will accept of, as the infallible test of
truth. And what is that evidence ?—Neither
more nor less than that which the constitu-
tion has established in the courts for the ge-
neral administration of justice; namely, t
the evidence convinces the jury, beyond atl
reasonable doubt, that the criminal intention,
constituting the crime, existed in the mind of
the man upon trial, and was the main spring
of his conduct. The rules of evidence, as
they are settled by law, and adopted in its
general administration, are not to be over-
ruled or tampered with.—They are founded
in the charities of religion—in the philosophy
of nature—in the truths of history, and in
the experience of common life; and whoever
ventures rashly to depart from them, let him
remember that it will be meted tu him in the
same measure, and that both God and man
will judge him accurdingly.—These are argu-
ments addressed to your reasons and con-
sciences, not to be shaken in upright minds
by any precedent, for no precedents can sanc-
tify injustice ;—if they could, every human
right would long ago have been extinct upon
the earth.—If the state trials in bad times
are to be searched for precedents, what mur-
ders may you not commit ;— what law of
humanity may you not trample upon ;—what
tule of justice may you not violate ;—and
what maxim of wise policy may you not
abrogate and confound? If precedents in
bad times are to be implicitly followed, why
should.we have heard any evidence st all?
You might have convi without any evi-

be followed, why should the Lords and Com-
mons have investigated these charges, and
the crown have put them into this course of
judicial trial? since, without such a trial, and
even afler an rieey upon one, they might
have attainted all the prisoners by act of par-
liament ;— they did so in the case of lord
Strafford.*—There are precedents, therefore,
for all such things :—but such precedents as
could not for a moment survive the times of
madness and distraction, which gave them
birth, but which, as soon as the spurs of the

‘that service, for all service,” said Mr. Burke,
“whether of revéende, ttade, or envke
trust is in her interest in the. Byitish con

tion. My hold of the colonies is in the close
affection which grows from common names,
from kindred blood, from similar privileges,
and equal protection. These are ties which,
though light: as air, ate as strong as links of
iron. Let the colonies always keep the idea
of: their civil rights associated with your go-
vernment, they will cling and grapple to you,
and no force under heaven will be of power to
tear them trom their allegiance. But let it be
once understood, that your government may
be one thing, and their privileges another;
that these two things may exist without any
mutual relation; the cement is gone; the
cohesion is loosened; and every thing hastens
to decay and dissolution. As long as you
have the wisdom to keep the sovereign autho-
rity of this country as the sanctuary of liberty,
the sacred temple consecrated to our common
faith, wherever the chosen race and sons of
England worship freedom, they will turn
their faces toward you. The more they mul-
tiply, the more friends you will have; the
more ardently they love liberty, the more
perfect will be their obedience. Slavery they
can have any where. It is a weed that grows
in every soil. They may have it from Spain,
they may have it from Prussia. But until you
become lost to all feeling of your true interest
and your natural dignity, freedom they can
have from none but you. This is the commo-
dity of price, of which you have the monopoly.
This is the true act of navigation, which binds
to you the commerce of the colonies, and
through them secures to you the wealth of the
warld. Is it not the same virtue which does
every thing for us here in England? Do you
imagine then, that it is the land-tax act which
raises your revenue? that it is the annual vote
in the Committee of Supply, which gives you
your army? or that it is the Mutiny Bill
which inspires it with bravery and discipline?
Neo! surely no! It is the love of the people;
it is their attachment to their government,
from the sense of the deep stake they have in
such a: glorious institution, which gives you
our army and your navy, and infuses into
h that liberal obedience, without which
your army would be a base rabble, and your
navy nothing but rotten timber.”*

place, as a member of Parliament, to promote
an inquiry into the seditious practices com-

tarily to come turward, proffered a sight of all
the papers, which were afterwards seized in
his custody, and tendered every possible assis-
tance to give satisfaction to the laws of his
country, if found to be offended. I will show

the whole of the inhabitants of London, and
the passages were so thronged that it was im-
possible for the judges to get to their carriages.
Mr. Erskine went out and addressed the mul-
titude, desiring them to confide in the justice
of the country ; reminding them that the only
security of Englishmen was under the inesti-
mable laws of England, and that any attempt
to overawe or bias them, would not only be

Mou saw Mr. Hardy frequently?—It was
very rarely that he was absent.

Were youacquainted with him ?—Perfectly
well; Ihave seen bim four, five, or six times
a week. I hardly ever missed a Sunday, but I
called upon him, either in the course of the
day, or in theevening.

What was his character—a man of a peace-
able disposition, or at all inclined to riot or
tumult?—A remarkably peaceable dispo-
sition. ;

Was he a friend to order ?—Very much 80;
there was an instance of it in the society, at
the time we were dispersed from the public-
houses ; he desired particularly, when we got
to a private house, that no member would even
bring a stick with him. ;

Then he was a great friend to peace and
order ?—Remarkably so.

What were the objects of your society ?—A
parliamentary reform; nothing else that I
ever heard.

In what House of parliament did you wish
that reform to take place ?—In’ the House of
Commons.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—The witness
should be told, that there is a question touch-
ing the conduct of the society, whether it is
highly criminal, or whether it is innocent;
the witness understanding that, and being wil-
ling to answer, may answer ; but he must un-
derstand that, in consequence of his answering
the questions, on the part of the prisoner, he
will also be liable to be examined on the same
points, on the part of the prosecution; and
that I cannot then protect him, if any ques-
tion is put to him that he would wish not to
answer,

Mr. Gibbs.—I understand so.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Every witness
should understand that when he is called.

Mr. Gibbs.—We think that every witness

to ask him a number of questions.

Had you any reason, from any conversation

any views either upon the House of Lords er

about ; letus know what the question is, and
the Court will give their assistance towards

Mr. Solicitor General.—The attorney gene-
ral objected, because the question was not put

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I do not exactly,
at this moment, know to what it pointed ; it
escaped me.

Mr. Gibbs.—I believe I had better go on
with the examination. You tell me you never

different views from those that you had ?—

Did Mr. Hardy ever produce, at the division
meeting of your society, any letter, that he
received from Sheffield, about pikes? —No;

Did he ever communicate it to you?—Never.

Florimond Goddard, Cross-examined by Mr.
Attorney General.

That Gentleman asked you whether Mr.
Hardy had ever communicated to you that let-
ter from Sheffield, you immediately said no.
Now I should be glad to ask you how you
knew what letter it was that that gentleman
alluded to—what is the letter that you mean
to speak of, when you say Hardy never com-
snunicated it to you ?—The Stiefheld letter.

I should be glad to know what Sheffield let-
ter you mean ?—-I do not know.

Then how came you to say he never com-
raunicated the Shefheld letter, withont know-

Mr. Gibbs.—I asked, in the examination in
chief, whether the letter, relating to pikes,
had been read; I putin those terms; I do
aver, upon my veracity, that did; and I will
not have that contradicted.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre —It is time for me
to interpose, and not to suffer these things to
pass at. the table. I agree that you did
ask the question in that manner, because I
have taken itso; but I also agree, that you
ought not to interrupt the cross-examination ;
they will put their questions in such manner
as they please, and you will setit right, if they

‘ put it wrong, when you come to re-examine

the witness ; there ought not to be any break-
ing in upon one another, because one gentle-
thinks that another gentleman did not
put the question in the manner he put it; he

“puts the question in the manner he under-

stands the gentleman put it.
Mr. Gibbs—Because there was a direct
contradiction to the fact.


Mr. Attorney General.—-I must entreat your
lordships to ms and I hold it to be m
duty to do it. There is a gentleman who is
not counsel in the cause, who sits next Mr,
Gibbs, and when I asked the witness the quee-
tion, what letter it was, I heard him in this
part of the Court, asI believe some other
gentlemen did, say, ‘‘ The letter about pikes.”
Now Ido not mean to say, and I desire in
justice to that gentleman to observe, that I do
not mean to say, by any means that he in-
tended the witness should hear that explana-
tion given to Mr. Gibbs; I do not believe it;
I therefore disavow that; but I must desire
that no gentleman should sit next the counsel
for the defendant, or the counsel for the
crown, who under--not the colour, I will not.
use that word---but under the fact of commu-
Nicating and conversing with the defendant’s
counsel, should, in point of fact, lead---1 do
not mean to say in point of intention—the
witness to giving an answer which he could
not have given.

Mr. Vaughan.—I presume, my lord, as I
have been personally alluded to, may be
permitted to speak.——I assure the attorney
general, and the whole court, upon my hon-
our, that [had none of the intentions, nor
would have been guilty of the fact which he
imputes to me; and the only circumstance
which induced me to make one single obser-
vation is this—that Mr. Erskine and Mr.
Gibbs did me the honour to desire that I would
sit next them, because some months ago I
was consulted upon the subject of this trial ;
that being the case, many circumstances
might occur to my recollection with which
they might not be acquainted. .

Lord Chief Justice Fyre—There can be no
objection at all; the Court will certainly not
interpose to prevent your sitting next the
Counsel who are assigned for the prisoner, and
giving them .any assistance that your parti-
ticular knowledge may enable you to give
them; at the same time that situation is a
delicate one, and you will undoubtedly take
particular care to avoid any thing that may give
any ground to any man alive to suppose you
donot make a correct useof it. I do not
suppose you do otherwise, I have not taken
any notice of your conduct that authorizes me
to make any objection to it; but if you said
any thing loud enough to be taken notice of
by the witness, you were not so.correct as you
should have been.

Mr. Vaughan.—I certainly would not, my
lord. If the Attorney-general desires, I will
remove to any other part of the court.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I do not desire
you should, for if you can, though not
assigned counsel for the prisoner, by your

.particular knowledge, be of any use to his

Counsel, the Court have no objection to your
giving any sort of communication you can
possibly give. . .
Mr. Attorney General.+I heard said ‘as
distinctly as I bear myself, when I put the
question, “ the letter about the pikes,”


Lord Chief Justice Eyre—I had really
taken down the answer of the witness before
any part of this conversation arose—“ that
de had never heard of any letter from Sheftield
about pikes.”

Mr. Attorney General —tow long have
you been a member of this society ?---Nearly
two years.

of January 1794 ?—I was.

Were you at Chalk Farm upon the 14th of
April ?—I was.

Being at the Globe tavern upon the 20th
of January, 1794, am I to understand you to
say, that nothing passed there but what was
quite peaceable and right, according to your
notion ?—Every thing was very peaceable,

Did you ever see a printed account of what
passed there?—Yes; there were some resolu-
tions. :

Which were afterwards printed ?—I was.

Were the resolutions that you saw in print
a correct account of what really did pass there?
—I think they were.

Then that being a correct account of what
did pass upon the 20th of January 1794, you
mean to state to the Court and the Jury that
the proceedings, as contained in that printed
‘paper, were according to your ideas correct
und poate and according 1o the law of
the Jand, as you understand ?—I understood

Tt so,

You said you were at Chalk Farm ?P—I was.

And you also mean to state as far as your
opinion goes, that the proccedings at Chalk-
¥arm were exactly what they really ought to
‘be?—~I thought so.

Perhaps you were at the meeting in
Breillat'’s yard when delegates were chosen
‘to be sent to Scotland ?—I was not.

Not being there, perhaps you did not
know the fact that a delegate was sent to
the convention in Scotland ?—Yes, I did.

Knowing the fact, you approved of that
measure, I suppose ?—Yes—I never was in
office, but I used regularly to attend.

Did you ever hoar of the Secret Committee
in your society ?—Yes, I have heard of it.

‘ ‘Then having -heard of the Secret Com-
:mittec, do you happen to know who the Se-
cret Committee were composed of ?—That I
never did.

‘Bless me! you were a member of the Cor-
-responding Society, which had a Secret Com-
:mittee; all their transactions were peaceable,
-and yet you do not know who the Secret Com-
-mittee were ?—No, I do not—I will say every
thing I know.

Every answer that you have given to me
yet proves to me that you are an honest man.


This society, whose proceedings wer »
feqeobl, had a Secret Committee ?—The
at

Was it known among the body in genen!
who the Secret Committee were ?—I do mn
think it was.

‘Then youmean to say, giving this characte
of the proceedings of this society, that ya
remained in the society; there being a secret
committee of persons whose names you dd
not know, of course you did not know whit
were the proceedings of any committee, the
names of which committee you did ma
know ?—I did not.

When the prisoner and some ether peopk

Do not you know that there was anothe:
Secret Comunittee formed ?—I do sot knowit

society.

about the society, you did nos choose tw ca
tinue any longer ?—I did nat.

Who were your delegates to the Scotch
Seavennots ?—Mr. Margarot and Mr. Ge-

Were you in the society, think you, before
the 6th of August 1792?—No; I was int
society two years within a month.

I hope you bave seen the address of the
6th of August, 1792?—I have, may be, bet 1

of it?-I do not; it is not in my memory
now, .

You say you know nothing at all about th>
Sheffield letter ?—No.

Did you ever hear of a circular Jetter that
wey sent into Scotland to call a conventian?
—Yes.

Who carried it into Scotland ?—I do not
know.

Do you know a person of the name of
Stock ?—I do not.

Hecollent yourself?—I do pot upon my
oath.

How did the printed circular letter, with
the name of T. Hardy at the bottom of it, get
into Scotland upon your oath ?—It was seat I
presume.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—How ?—I do not

ow.

Mr. Attorney General.—How do you kaow
that it was sent there P—I do not know.

In point of fact, did you ever hear whether
that circular letter went or not?—It might or
might not.

hat is no answer, so might 1; _ 1 might or
might not, but, in point of tact, did you ever
hear whether that circular letter ever went?
—It might or might not.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—But the ques-
tion is, have you heard it or not?—I might

have heard it, but I cannot recollect the cir-
cumstance.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—-I have taken it
down, that you heard ot a circular letter which
went into Scotland ?-—I heard it went down
into Scotland.

Mr. Attorney General.—Where did you hear
that ?--At the division.

Did you hear any thing what this circular
letier was about---what were the contents of
it?—To call a convention; I cannot repeat
any thing of it. :

You consider all the proceedings at the
Globe-tavern on the 20th of January, and
also the proceedings at Chalk Farm, as in
your opinion, quite peaceable and constitu-
tional proceedings ?—I thought so.

That is your notion of the matter?—Yes.

You sing some songs now and then in your
society do not you ?—Never in the society,

How came you never te sing them in the
socicty ?—I know not.

Is it done on purpose, or how happens that?
—I know not, we were a very peaceable
suciety—-songs were not in general introduced
atall. ‘

I hope you do not mean to say that there
were no songs sung at your dinner?—There
were songs then.

Did you never hear of a very good song,
called “ God save the Rights of Man ?”—I
have heard of such a sung.

Perhaps you sung it sometimes yourself?—
Never.

Can you tell us what the contents of itare ?
—I cannot repeat a verse, or a line, or a
syllable.

Perhaps you could inform me if you were
to see it?—I could read it if I saw it.

Did you ever heat of a song that has this
chorus :—-

<< Plant, plant the tree, fair freedom’s tree,

“ "Midst dangers, wounds, and slaughter,
*¢ Fach Patriot’s breast its soil shall be,

“ And Tyrant’s bluod its water.”

Do you recollect that song?—You know
more of it than I do—I have heard of such a
song.

You have heard this song sung, you say,
“Plant, plant the tree?’ —I cannot say,
upon my recollection, that I ever have
heard it.

Then how came you to tell me you had
heard something about “ Plant, plant the
tree ?”—I have heard there were a number of
songs; I do not know that I ever heard it
sung, but I may.

When I asked you, and I appeal to the
Court and the Jury, if ever you heard a song,
the chorus of which was “ Plant, plant the
tree”—you said yes?—I have heard there
‘were such songs.

Did not you tell me you had heard that
particular sung?—I beg your pardon, I did
not tell you su.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---You certainly
gaid you had heard the song, “ Plant, plant



the tree."—-I have heard there was such a
song, but I never heard it.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---You are quite
at liberty to explain, but you did say that you
had heard the song, “ Plant, plant the tree?”
--[ have; but I have said I never heard the
gong in the society, and there were a number
of songs sung---there was a man that did
attend the society with songs, a pack of idle
songs, and we would not sutfer him tu attend
the place.

Mr. Attorncy General_-How many songs
of Mr. Thelwall’s have you ever seen, or had
in your possession ?---] have had them all,
but I thought there was no harm in Mr.
Thelwall’s songs.

Then you mean to swear you think
there was no harm in Mr. Thelwall’s songs?
---I thought there was no harm in them when
they were sold in public shops.

Do you mean to swear that you thought
there was no harm in Mr. Thelwall’s songs?
---Yes, 1 do not think there was in those’
that I saw---J do not know what songs he
may have wrote. ,

Be so good as tell us the names of some of
Mr. Thelwall’s songs, as you have all of
them ?---I do not know what all of them is.

Tell us the name of some of them ?.--There’
was one very long one, I cannot recollect the
title of it.

You have all of Mr. Thelwall’s songs, but
you cannot tell the title of one of them ?—I
do not know how many songs he wrote, there
were threc of Mr. Thclwall’s songs ; I do not
koow what you mean by all.

They were printed all upon one sheet of
paper, I believe ?---They were sold publicly.

And dispersed all over the country, were
they not ?---I cannot tell; upon my oath I do
not know that they were dispersed any where.

Tfave you those songs in your possession?
—I have.

What were the titles of them?---I cannot
recollect the titles.

Mr. Attorney General.—-Look at this paper,
read a part of that song, and tell me whether
thatis one?

Goddard.---Which song do you mean?

Mr. Altorney General.---“ God save the
Rights of Man.”—Jt might or might not, E
cannot say.

Mr. Erskine.—Is your lordship’s time to be’
consumed about this gentleman’s opinion
upon asong? ;

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—If the song is
proved to have been sung in the society, then
itis competent to ask whether that song is
peaceable; but unless the song is proved to
have been sung there

Goddard.—I never heard this song sung
there.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—He has said that
all the proceedings there were peaceable and
orderly ; then if this song is proved to have
been sung there, there certainly can be no.
impropriety in asking him whether, according

3R


to his judgment, that proceeding was peace-
able and orderly, but it is not proved that it
was sung there.

Mr. Erskine.—But it is not proved that it
was either sung or said there.

Mr. Attorney General.— Look at that
[showing a paper to the witness] and tell me
whether that was printed by order of the
Corresponding Society, or not?—Not as I
know of. .

Had you ever a paper of that sort in your
jhand?—Not as I can recollect, and I would
recoltect if 1 conld;—as I told you, I never
was-in office, but F regularly attended.

subject but politics P—It was called the Con-
stitutional Society.

That is no answer to my question; wha

you went there, you said, you went there be-
cause you had no opportunity of attending the
Houses of parliament, and went to hear clever
then speak; upon what subject did you gu
expecting to hear them speak ?—Upon con-
stitutional subjects.

And those only ?---Those only.

Was that the place where you took up your
constitutional doctrine ?—Long before that.

From the newspapers ?---Sometimes I have
had the honour of being in the honourable
House of Commons to hear the debates.

And you went to the Constitutional Society
not having opportunities to attend the House
of Commons, to supply that defect?—Not to
supply that defect merely, but to hear differ-
ent political subjects discussed.

You had no other means of supplying the
information ?---Not any that I thought better.

Did you attend frequently?—You may be
better informed than I am.

I know nothing.---I ask you?---T never
kept any minutes of my attendance there.

Did you not, upon your oath, attend them
weekly ?---When I could, I did; and might
for a month together when 1 could; but I
cannot be upon my oath to say, that I did at-
tend them weekly ; I was happy to attend
them weekly when I could.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—-You mean you
attended them as often as you could ?—Yes,

Mr. Bower.— Were youatall acquainted with
the proceedings of the society >—Very little ;
Tnever looked into their books.

Then you did not know of any of their trans-
actions which might bring some of them, or
those they employed, into difficulties No,

You never knew that any body was prose-
cuted fur assisting them in their views P—
Never.

Did you never hear of one William Carter?
—Never.

Then, of course, you never heard that he
was in cunfinement at all?—Stay, Mr. Coun-
sel, give me leave to say, I was in company
with a Mr. Carter, musician, at the London
coffee house.

Do you recollect Carter, the bill sticker ?—
Tam not, in a moment, to be told that I re-
collect such a man if I do not; I heard of such
a man, that he was in prison (I never saw him
In prison) for sticking upa posting bill.—You
asked me iff knew such aman? I do not;
T heard of him.

You heard nothing more of him but that
there was such a man?—I heard there was.

That is all. You never heard that there
was a subscription entered into for him?—
Yes ; perhaps, I gave him a shilling, or half-
a-crown, or a guilica, or five guineas, towards
his relief, in confinement ; but I do not know
that I did to maintain himin his confinement.
Idid not recollect the name of Carter any
More than I do your's.

That is then what you now mean to swear

distinctly, for I will not let you now go back ?
Ido not say I gave two guineas, or five, but


T only say I subscribed something, perhaps,
to the poor man’s family.

Did not vou say two or five guineas?—-I
often give five guineas without knowing to
whom I give it.

Did you not, a minute ago, say you might:
have given a shilling, or half-a-crown, or a
guinea, or five guineas, to this man, in con-
finement, for sticking up bills?---I did not
say so, tothe man for sticking up bills.

Your gestures will not do ?---You seem to
wish to confuse me.

Ido not wish to confuse you ;---the more
distinct you give your answer the better; do
you mean to say, upon your oath, that you
did not recollect when you said, you might
have given one, two, or five guineas to this
man ?—-[ did not mean to say, I had given
one, two, or five guineas, but I might have
given half-a-crown.

Did you give one, two, or five guineas ?—~I
say, Idid not; I might give a few shillings ;
I give shillings, as much as you do halfpence,
to any poor man that wants it.

Then, I understand, you now swear dis-:
tinctly, you might give this man a shilling;
but that you did not give him five guineas ?---
No

Upon your oath, you did not give this man
two guineas, or five guineas?~-No; I cannot
recollect what I gave him. ’

You never gave him a guinea, or five gui-.
neas?—-Not to my recollection.

Did you ever give him any thing ?~-I do
not recollect; I often give to poor men and
women indistress. I gave a hundred and fifty
pounds to the British fishery, when I thought
my country in distress.

Task you, whether you did, or not, sub-
scribe any sum of money to the man who
was in confinement, for sticking up bills for
the society, and on that account?—I gave, I
believe, to the best of my recollection, sume-
thing, but what I cannot tell.

To whom did you give something ?—That I
do not know.

Who asked you for it?—In some of the so-
cieties, which, and where, I do not know.

What societies ?—The Corresponding So-
cieties.

At the time you gave that, was a subscrip-
tion put about for the relief of this man so in
custody ?—There must have been a mention
of itor I should not have known it; but Ido
not recollect in what manner.

Did you attend one, or more of theee s0-
cieties ?~One.

Which was that?—The London Corres-
ponding Society.

At which house ?—At Proctor’s, in Covent
Garden.

Was it there you subscribed }—No ; it was,
I believe, in Compton-street, if I recollect
right; the last time I was at any of those s0-
cieties.

Was Compton-street a place where the de-
legates met, or a division meeting Among

the divisions, I believe; I did not belong to
any delegate society, but to the common
meeting.

Which division of the society did you be-
long to?—Proctor’s, No. 2, Covent Garden;
this was, I think, No. 31, Compton-street.

Did you go there as a visitor ?—I believe I
moust have been a member of that.

You are now a member of the Covent
Garden division ?—Yes.

Then, whether you have been a member of
that in Compton-street, you do not know ?—
Itis the same thing; not a separate society.

The same division ?—A separate division.

My question is, whether you belonged to
one, or two divisions of this society ?—To
more than one; I think to another;- I
think 37.

Did you belong to more than two?—I am
not sure of that; if I belonged to ten, I should
own it with pleasure.

- When you werein the society, did you know
any thing of any secret committee; perhaps
a never heard of any such thing ?—I never

id.
Did you ever hear of the committee of cor-
respondence?—Never. I have heard of it since,
Not in the society ; I have not been in the so-
ciety since such a thing has been mentioned.

Of course you know nothing of any secret
committee ?—Never. ;

Ifa secret committee had been mentioned,
it would have been to you a matter of sur-

rise ?—I do not understand you; I never
Beard of a secret committee of the society in
my life.

Did you ever hear of any letter that had
been written by the prisoner >—Never.

Alexander Wills Re-examined by Mr. Gibbs

You had heard that there was a man in
custody who was in distress P—I had.

Did you, at that time, know the man’s
name ?—I recollect it now; I did not, when
the learned judge spoke to me, recollect that
there was such a man in being.

Was he represented to you as an object in
distress ?—In real distress. :

And for that man so imprisoned, and so in
distress, did you subscribe any money ?—I did,
but what sum I cannot tell; I cannot charge
my memory whether it was a shilling, a
guinea, or half-a-guinea.

What was your reason for saying, just now,
that you perhaps subscribed a guinea, or two
guineas, or five guineas P—Becausc I would as
soon give the one as the other, for a poor fa-
mily, of individual, in distress.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—You have brought

rself into a scrape, only for the sake of a
lourish, When you are upon your oath, if
you would only speak plain English, you
would be under no difficulty ; there is a great
difference between a shilling and a guinea, and
five guineas, therefore you should not have
conveyed an idea that you did not know whe-
ther you gave one shilling, two shillings, one’


guinea, or five guineas. I would advise you,
when you are upon your oath, never to

by metaphor ; you have brought yourself into
aevelties but I dare say you meant very
right. ;

Mr. Attorney-General.—I beg your lort-
ship will ask him what he gave.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—How much did
you give, in plain English?—Perhaps a few
shillings, perhaps half-a-crown.

- Mr. Attorney General,—Will your lordship
please to ask him if it was not a guinea.

- Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Do you say it
was not a guineaf—A tew shillings, to the
best of my knowledge.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Under, or about
five shillings?—] suppose under.

Mr. Gibs.—I will now call-a gentleman at
the bar, who says he knows this witness per-
fectly well, and that he is a man of goud cha
racter.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—That is perfectly
irregular. It was certainly absurd in the wit-
ness not to recollect that he was upon his cath,
and to talk in that rhodomontade way. I
dare say he meant to speak the truth.

about this parliamentary reform by force o

Most assuredly I do not; I never heard
any thing like force of arms out of the reports
of the secret committee of the House of Com
mons; I have read them attentively ; I never

ports; I have heard it reported there. ’

Were you or not there ?—I do not recollect
I was ever at any society where Mr. Wharton
was in the chair.

Were you or not there on the 2nd of May,
without reference to who was in the chair ?-—
If it was a meeting of the Correspondin;
Society, and you will tell we where it was,

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—The inquiry is,

You have said that the proceedings of the
Corresponding Society were peaceable ?—As
far as I could collect them, they were so.

You have said, you heard the resolutions
carried at Chalk-farm—were they peaceable?
—I have not said that I heard them.

Did you hear them, or not; I understood
you said you did hear them?—I heard them
read, but I did not attend to them.

Did you vote for them, or no?—I did not.

How came it that you did not vote for

You have fullowed business?—I was, I be-
lieve, a perfumer.

And had you forgot what business you
were; were not you a hair-dresser ?—Yes,

Had you forgotten that circumstance, when
I asked you just now ?—I thought a perfumer
was sufficient.

But you said, it was so long ago since you
were in business, that you did not know what
business you followed: how long is it since
you have done business as a hair-dresser ?—I
think it is, since I followed the business of a
hair-dresser, about twelve years, to the best
of my recollectien ; I am not quite sure.

And how long since you followed the busi-

ness of a perfumer?—At the same time,

Did you cease to be both at the same time?
—Yes.

About twelve years ago?—I would not
swear, upon my oath, to the time; but it is
thereabouts. .

Then having this perfect recollection that
you have been a perfumer and a hair-dresser,
about twelve years ago, how came you to tell
me it was so long ago, you did not recollect
what business you bad carried on ?—I did not
say that,

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—What he said

Have you known Mr. Mardy, the prisonet-
-~I have known Mr. Hardy, the prisonct.
about four years, between three and far
years; I accidentally got acquainted with Mr.
Hardy by stopping at a house during ashore
ofrain; I fell into his company, and at til
time I found him very agreeable.

I will not lead you into that sort of
count of him; what I want to know of yous.
you say you have known him between thre
and four years; what character has he boro:
during that time?-—I will speak, if you ¥
give me leave, a few words, very short.

Mr. Attorney General.—-I have no object
to what the gentleman pleases to say.—Fine
ing Mr. Hardy very agreeable in conversato?,
and speaking like a very serious man, Ii
quired hig address; he told me at No.?,
Piccadilly, and told me he should be glad ®
see me; I called on him there, and request)
in my calls, we have talked on religiow sab-
jects, and sometimes on political subjects; #
one time Mr. Hardy showed me a papet
which his name was affixed, some res

ed with the teausactigns of the socicty /—No. | of the London Corresponding Society; 548°

mediately asked him the intent, or ultimate
end and design that this society had in view,
and he told me it was a reform of parliament,
that is to say, of the House of Commons, upon

eaceable and constitutional principles; he
farther added upon the same principles which
his grace the duke cof Richmond and the
right hon. William Pitt were engaged in, in
the year 1782. I have frequently, in conver-
sation, inquired of him, and tried to suck out,
to gain what was the inteut of the society,
when I heard something about these reports
of the Committee of the House of Commons,
and so on, and he told me by all means it was
to obtain a parliamentary reform upon con-
stitutional principles, in a peaceable manner.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Since the report?
-~Yes.

Where did you see him ?— At his own house.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—-Since the report?
---Yes; since the report.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre---Recollect your-
self?——I saw Mr. Hardy at his own house, it
was in the summer, I believe it was since the
report of the House of Commons; I am not
clear when that report was made exactly to
the date, nor will I undertake to swear.

Lord Chiet Justice Eyre.—Therefore I stopt
you, that you might recollect yourself.

Mr. Gebbs.—-State as near as you can the
time ?---I think it was some time about the
beginning of June, or in May, I am not sure ;
but I was in the habit of calling upon him as
a neighbour when I have gone past.

Do you remember the time he was taken
up?--I_ do mot remember the date of it; I
remember to have called at Mr. Hardy's, and
then I was informed by his wife that he was
taken up; she was in a great deal of trouble,
and very ill ; she was frightened upon the
occasion,

She is dead since?—-Yes; and she told me
but a few days

You must not say what she told you---you
are not sure what the time was when you
had this conversation?--I belicve in the
Month of May, to the best of my recollection.

Are you a member of cither of these socic-
ties?--I never was in my life a member of
any political society whatever.

During the time that you have known him,
what has been his character, I mean as a
peaceable man, or the contrary ?---I conceived
from my first acquaintance with him, that he
was a man of few words, and of a very humble,
peaceable disposition, and I have never had
any occasion to alter that opinion. I believe
him to be a man of an honest disposition, and
added to that, if I can judge from a man’s
conversation, I belicve he is one that fears
God and honours the King.

_ You have collected this from your conversa-
tion with him ?--I have from knowing him,
and the general tenor of his conduct.

Have you seen him often ?-~I have.

You told me you had taken pains to draw
from him what his opinions were ?---I have



when J first became acquainted with him, and
after that, I helieve { may say with some
degree of confidence, that I was in his confi-
dence as a friend; I believe he looked upon
me as a friend.

The rev. Thomas Oliver cross-examined by
Mr. Alturney General.

You did not belong to any of these societies?
—I did not.

Did you ever see a paper published as the
proccedings at Chalk-Farm, with Mr. Hardy’s
name to it?—I never did.

Did you ever see a paper published as the
proceedings on the Oth of January, 1794,
with Mr. llardy’s name to it?—Icannot charge
my memory that I ever saw it, I do not recol-
lect the contents of it; I trouble my head
very little about politics.

Look at that paper? [showing it to the
witness. ]—I do not recollect that I ever saw
the fellow to this paper, or this paper before.

Did you know that Mr. Hardy was a mem-
ber ofa society that had published resolutions
in support of Mr. Thomas Paine’s Rights of
Man?.--No; I did not.

Then I need not ask you, I take for granted,
whether publishing those resolutions in favour
of Paine’s Rights of Man, shows the sort of
man that you would suppose honours the
king? what is your answer to that?—I do
not know, nor never did know, that Mr. Hardy
did favour those resolutions, or that he pub-
lished any thing of the kind. As I was going
to observe, I have but very little time to
meddle with those matters; when I can call
upon any person that is afflicted, or any poor
person, or any one to do them any good, I
am always ready to do it; but I have four
sermons to preach in a week, and as I make
them myself, I have very little spare time.

Did you cver see the bouk, called Paine’s
Rights of Man?---I have seen it, but never
read it through.

Do you know that Mr. Paine was a member
of the Constitutional Society ?—I do not
know any such thing. :

Do you happen to know Mr. Bogue, a
dissenting minister ?—TI have heard of sucha
name, but [ do not know the gentleman,

Do you happen to know whether he had
any correspondence with Mr. Mardy ?—Once
upon a time, I think, Mr. Hardy mentioned
his name, but I do not know that he said he
had a correspondence with him,

Did he inform you whether Mr. Bogue had
given him any advice about the papers?
Never such a thing was ever mentioned to
me by Mr. Lardy.

What did he say to you about Mr. Dogue,
the dissenting minister at Portsmouth ’—I
think Mr. Hardy asked me if I knew such a
gentleman, and that he was a worthy good
man, or to that purpose.

Did he explain to you at all how he came
to know any thing of Mr. Bogue of Ports-
mouth ?—By no means in the world. :

38

So that you visited Mr. Hardy, he informed ]
you he knew Mr. Bogue, a dissenting minister
at Portsmouth, and you had not the curiosity
to inquire what Mr. Hardy in London, had to
do with Mr. Bogue, a dissenting minister at
Portsmouth?—No. .

Upon your oath, did Mr. Hardy ever tell
you that he had or not been down at Ports-
mouth to visit any convicts on board a ship at
Portsmouth?—No.

: Nor that he had seen Mr. Bogue upon that
occasion ?—No, nor any other.

You know nothing of Mr. Hardy’s senti-
ments about Paine’s works?—The chief I
know of him has been his conversation touch-
ing the best things; sometimes he has spoken
of politics and parliamentary reform, and that
he was a well-wisher to it.

am said you had read Paine’s work ?—Part
of it.

Have you ever read any thing about ho-
nouring the king in it ?—No.

I think you said you were much in Mr.
Hardy’s confidence ?—I do not know how
much, but as a minister may call upon him;
it is reasonable to expect they will put confi-
dence in men of our description, when men
of character and probity.

Then he never told you any thing about the
roceedings of the London Corresponding
Society, either at Chalk-Farm or any of those

other places?—He did not; I only came to
sak as to what I know about Mr. Hardy's
character.

Mr. Daniel Stuart sworn.---Examined by
Mr. Gibbs.

Thelieve you are secretary to the Society of
the Friends of the People?—I have acted as
secretary to the committee of that society.

Meeting in Frith-street?-Yes.

Have you ever happened to see Mr. Hardy
the’ prisoner ?—Very frequently.

Upon what occasions have you seen him?-—
I have seen him many years ago, but never
had occasion to speak to him til] within some-
thing less than two years ; about December,
1792.

Upon what occasion did you see him then?
~The London Corresponding Society sent a
letter to the Society of the Friends of the
People; when the letter was answered I car-
ried the answer myself to Mr. Hardy’s house
in Piccadilly, and delivered it to him, and
from that time in passing Piccadilly frequently,
I have called in at his shop, merely to converse
with him, and to know what news there was.

Had Pea any conversationswith him relative
to the London Corresponding Society ?—Very
frequently.

hat did he tell you the object of that |

society was?—He always told me the sole
‘object of the society was, a reform in the re-
presentation in the House of Commons.

Did he ever converse with you upon the
way in which he wished that reform to be
brought about? ~


Mr. Attorney General.—Thatis not a proper
question. ;

Mr. Gibbs.---I ask this in order to sift the
mind of the prisoner; the crime imputed to
the prisoner is an act of the mind; this case is
an anomalous one—the compassingin his own
mind the king’s death ; I am asking as to the
conversations he has had upon the subject, in
order to find what were his intentions, what
the state of his mind was upon that subject.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—What the tenor
of his conversation was, is, I suppose, your
object.

Mr. Attorney Generali cannot say 1
think it worth disputing.

Mr. Gibbs.---What were the means by
which you understood from him that the Lon-
don Corresponding Society wished to bri
about this end?—I always understood from
him, that he thought the best means were to
inform the people of the bad state of the re-
presentation, and so to gain a number of
members to the society, that they might get a
great number of signatures to a petition to
ie con by which means a reform might

e obtained.

Did you see him at any time after this ?---
Since that time, till the time that he was taken
up, I was in the habit of calling on him per-
haps once, twice, or more times in a week ; it
was very uncertain ; prineipally from curiosity
I used to call at his house, and have conversa-
tion with him generally about his society,
and the other societies that his society were
in correspondence with, about what they were
doing respecting a reform in parliament ; that
always made the basis of our conversation.

Did it appear to you, that he re,
dence in you ?—I have not a doubt he did; we
talked very freely about a reform and the best
means of producing it, and in one point he
and I never could agree; he said the duke of
Richmond's plan would be the plan at last—I
said I did not think it was the best plan; that
was the only point we disagreed upon.

Had you any conversation with him con-
cerning this convention ‘that was talked
about

Mr. Attorney General.—This convention
that was talked ‘about—not having said one
word about a convention.

Mr. Gibbs.—There may be a little irregu-
larity in putting the question, I only want to
bring him to the time.

Lord Chiet' Justice Eyre.—You onght to
inquire to be sure, first of all, whether he
knows any thing of a osed convention,
and whether he had any opportunity of know-
ing what the prisoner's sentiments were fe-
specting that convention.

Mr. Gibbs.—Had you ever any conversatien
with him ?————

Mr. Stuart.—There is one thing in pert
cular I think it my duty to mention with re-
gard to whether he was likely to confide in
me, or tell me his mind——— ;

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—You have said

you thought he did put confidence in you?r—
There was one particular occasion

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I do not want
to know the private history between you and
him ; if you say you think he put confidence
in you, it is very well.

_ Mr. Gibbs——Had you ever any conversa-
tion with him abont any convention ?—I do
not exactly remember that I had; but I have
no doubt that I had.

During the time you have known him,
what character has he borne ?—From others
and from my own observation, I have always
thought him a very simple man in his man-
ners; of a very inoffensive, peaceable con-
duct, and the last man I should have thought
that would have been guilty of any violent
conduct.

Have you had any opportunity of collecting
from him whether it was his object to bring
this about by peaceable means, or otherwise ?
—I have always heard him say he wished it
to be brought about by peaceable means; I
never heard bim mention violent means in my
life—quite the reverse.

Mr. Daniel Stuart cross-examined by Mr.
Attorney General

You are secretary to a society calling them-
selves the Friends of the People ?—Secretary
to the committee of the society ; I never was
appointed secretary to the society.

You know there is a society in London
called the Society for Constitutional Informa-

* tion ?—Yes; I know there is.

It may possibly have occurred to you, as
secretary to the Society of the Friends of the
People, to know that the latter society re-
jected all correspondence with the former?—
Yes; I know that.

Did you happen to know that the prisoner
at the bar was an associated member of that
society ?—I never heard that he was; I never
knew of my own knowledge who were mem-
bers of either the London Corresponding So-
ciety, or the Society tor Constitutional Infor-
mation, S

Then you being secretary to the committee
of the Society of the Friends of the People,
and the Society of the Friends of the People
having rejected all correspondence with the
Society for Constitutional Information, you
did not know that the prisoner was an asso-
ciated member of the Society for Constitu-
pane Information ?—I never knew it in my

fe.

.Do you remember a letter being written
by your society to the Society for Constitu-

. ae Information, from lord John Russel ?—
es,

.Do you remember any correspondence be-
tween your society, the Friends of the People,
and_a society at Sheffield P—Yes, I do,

Do you recollect whether that was in the
month of May, 1792, or not?—Yes; I think
the first letter received from Sheflield was in
the month of May, 1792,


Do you happen to know, that the society
at Sheffield, in the month of May, 1792,
wrote a letter to the Constitutional Society,
whose correspondence your society bad re-
jected, saying, they would have nothing more
to do with the Friends of the People, because
they were not pursuing the principles of the
rights of man?—I know nothing of that
at all.

‘Do you recollect what were the reasons
why the Society of the Friends of the Feople
would have nothing more to do with the So-
ciety for Constitutional Information?—I be-
lieve the reasons are assigned in the letter
that was sent in answer.

With reference to their having recom-
mended Mr. Paine’s great plans of reform ?—
Yes; I believe that is in the answer.

Do you happen to know, that the London
Corresponding Society have been going upon
the same plans of reform ?—I cannot exactly
say that I did. .

Did you ever see the London Correspond-
ing Society’s address of the 6th of August,
1792 ?—I cannot say I ever saw it.

Did you ever see an address of the London
Corresponding Society of the 20th of January,
1794?—I have. .

Have you seen the London aneeponing
Suciety’s resolutions at Chalk-farm?—-Yes,
have.

They wrote to your society about a con-
vention, I believe /—They did. .

You rejected that?— The society de-
clined it.

I believe your society had some corres-
pondence with the London Corresponding
Society ; during all these proceedings, do you
recollect any application they made to you to
know the principles of your society ?—I think
there was a letter, not exactly to know the
principles of the society, but to know the
plan they meant to adopt.

Did your society inform them what length
they meant to go at that time?—I believe
they declined to inform them.

Do I understand you right, that you never
heard of the prisoner’s being an associated
member of the Constitutional Society whose
correspondence your society had rejected;
that you knew nothing of the address of the
London Corresponding Society of the 6th of
August, 1792; that you knew nothing except
what you have learned now of the proceed-
ings of the 20th of January, 1794, and of the
proceedings at Chalk-farm?—Nothing more.

Look at this printed paper [showing it to
the witneanl is this an account of the pro-
ceedings of your society ?—This seems an au~
thentic copy of the proceedings of the society
I belong to. ;

As you were secretary to the society, you
can inform me whether the nee whose
names appear here, are all members of the
Society of the Friends of the People?—I be-
lieve not all of them ; some have withdrawn,
and some new members have been added to

_ this society, since that list was made.

You are aware of the fact, supposing it to
bea fact, that after the Society of the Friends
of the People had rejected correspondence
with the Constitutional Society, by their
letter, that some individuals still remained
members of both societies ?—Yes; I do not
exactly know farther than from report, who
were members of the Constitutional Society,
but from the evidence I certainly believe that
there were gentlemen who were members of

both.
Mr. Daniel Stuart re-examined by Mr. Gibbs.

What objections did the Friends of the Peo-
ple take to that letter which was sent to
them ?—I really cannot say what objections ;

at the time that Ictter was sent, it was in the |

beginning of the society, and at that time I
was Never present at the meetings of the so-
ciety, or the committee, and cannot form any
opinion of any other objections than what
are slated in the Ictter.

—Never.

Mr. Attorney General.—That is a question
never put.

Mr. Gidbs.—It is a question I never heard
any objection to,

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—TI have often
heard it put, and often heard it objected to;
it is certainly nota strictly regular question;
you are to ask his general character, and
from thence the jury are to conclude, whether
a man of such a character would commit such
an offence; at the same time, in justice to
the geet T must say I have known it

; Present,

‘ Lord Chief Justice Eyre, Lord Chief Baron
; Macdonald, Mr. Baron Hotham, Mr.
Justice Buller, Mr. Justice Grose, and
others his Majesty’s Justices, &c.

Thomas Hardy set to the bar.

Mr. Erskine.—My lord, I would now state
a fact, which probably the attorney-general
‘will admit.—Your lordship, and the jury, will


tecollect, that in the course of the evidence, a
letter was proved to have been written by one
Davison, at Sheffield, to the prisoner at the
bar, Mr. Hardy, enclosing a letter (which
letter was also read to the jury), which was
requested to have been forwarded by the pri- °
soner to Norwich, for purposes similar to that
for which Davison is supposed to have sent
it; I wish to prove, by a gentleman now in
my eye, if the fact is not admitted, that that
letter was found in Mr. Hardy’s possession
unopened.

Lord Chief Justice E£yre.—The material
observation arising upon it is that it was
unsent, because he had no business to open it.

Mr. Erskine.—It is a strong circumstance
that it remained unopened and unsent, for
such a length of time.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Its being unsent’
is, I think, a strong circumstance indeed, but
its being unopened J do not think amounts to
much.

John King, esq. sworn.—Examined by Mr.
Erskine.

Did you find the letter in the possession of
the prisoner, when he was taken into custody,
which has been given in evidence, in an
enclosure ?—No; I did not find any of the
letters, they were all taken away by the peuple
who came.

Did you see them ?—I saw them.

Was the enclosure of the letter, that was
directed to Norwich, open or not?—I cannot
exactly speak as to that fact ; but I remember
the messenger, while he was marking the
paper, said, “ here is a letter unopened,” I

se that to be the letter.
ho was that person?-—I think it was
Gurmell.

You recollect the messengers taking notice
that there was a letter then unopened ?---Yes;
which I understood to be a letter, enclosed in
another letter. I said, “ open that letter and
mark it the same as the rest.”

David Martin (sworn)—Examined by Mr.
Erskine.

What is your trade ?—-An engraver.

Where is your place of residence ?—At
Sheffield.

How long have you been an inhabitant of
Sheffield ?---About twelve years.

Have you carried on trade during that time?
—I have.

Were you a member of the Sheffield So-
ciety ?-—I was.

When did you become so ?---Within about
three months from the time of its commence-
ment.

Up to what time did you continue a mem-
ber ?—-Till the time that Mr. Camage, and
other persons, were taken up; that is, I have
not attended at the society since.

What was your object in being a member of
that society ?~-For the purpose of obtaining a
reform in the Commons House of Parliament,
by legal and constitutional means.

That was your own object ?---It was. °

Task you, upon your solemn oath, and the
truth is better than all other things, from all
that you observed, and heard, and saw, in the
course of your attendance upon that society,
had you any reason to believe, or have you
now, before God, any reason to believe, that
their objects were different from your own?-—
By no means.’ .

Did you ever see any thing pass, or did you
hear any thing that led you to believe, or that
Jeads you now to believe, that there was an
intention to attack the government by armed
force and violence?---Not the most distant
idea of it.

Were you a member of the Sheffield Society
at the time it sent its delegates to Scotland?
~—Yes, 1 was.

From what passed in the society, upon that
occasion, what was your object in sending
your delegate ; what was he to do?---For the
purpose of co-operating with the other dele-
gates from the different societies, in order to
produce the object I have already mentioned.

By what means did you intend, or contem-
plate, that this end was to be accomplished ?
---By a petition to parliament.

What was the reason, after the petition
brought forward by Mr. Grey had been re-
jected, for having delegates? what did you
expect would be the consequence of a petition
from dclegates?---1 do not perfectly under-
stand you.

What good effect did you expect to arise
from sending delegates in order to have a
petition from large bodies of people ?--The
effect of a general co-operation of the great
body of the people, the effect of the general
sentiment,

What effect did you expect that sentiment
to produce? did you expect it to make an im-
pression upon the parliament so as to induce
them to grant the redress applied for ?--Yes.

You expected that the general sentiment of
the people, as far as you could collect it, would
make an impression upon the parliament, and
produce that effect ?---I did.

Task you solemnly, upon your oath, whe-
ther it was in your comtemplation, or from
what you heard and saw in the course of the
debates and proceedings, as far as you are ac-
quainted with them, whether it was the inten-
tion of those delegates to contrive means by
which parliament should be compelled to
grant it?---Ry no means.

Would you have remained a member of the
society it veu had reason to believe or suspect
that that was the object ?-~I certainly would
not.

Was any thing said, or did you collect from
the gencral objects of your society, that it was
their intention to affect the king's majesty,
either in his person, or his state and dignity?
—Certainly not.

Was there any intention that you could
collect (I am not asking your ideas or imagi-
nation) from what passed in your hearing in


the course of the proceedings of the societs,
to touch the Lords House of Parliament?—
Certainly not.

Were yau at the Castle-hill when Mr. Yorke
made a speech there ?---I attended the latter
end of the meeting; but I heard very litueo
It.

I take for granted that every now and thes
a hot spirit might show itself?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.---Do not take am
thing for granted when you are examipings
witness.

Mr. Erskine —I will not ask any moe
questions; I am quite satisfied with what be
has said.

the Constitutional Society in London, so long

Society being read in the committee, desins2
that you might propose that you should be

do not particularly recollect.

Particularly recollect! do you recollect 32
thing about it?—-I cannot take upon me t
say.
Witt you say you do not recollect ?—1 6
not recollect. . :

You were not acquainted, I believe, with


the particulars of the conduct of the conven-

tion in Scotland, were you?—No farther than

what appeared in the public newspapers.
What newspapers are you speaking of —

The Edinburgh papers.

¥ What, the paper called the Gazetteer? * —
e8.

Then am I to understand you, that you
know of the proceedings of the convention, as
they appeared in that Gazetteer?—I have
heard them read.

Then you approved of the proceedings as
they appeared in that Gazettecr, did you?—
Not altogether.

What part of them did you disapprove of ?—~
Particularly that part relating to a secret com-
mittee.
it? you a secret committee at Sheffield ?—

0.

You had not got so far as that?—No, no-
thing of the kind was ever entertained.

You say you were at the Castle-hill?—I was
_ at partofthe meeting; at only the latter part
of the meeting.

you remember that when somebody
Proposed to petition the House of Commons,
It was negatived, and it was determined to
petition the House of Commons no more ?—I
was at the outside of the people, and thercfore
could not hear the proceedings.

You would probably have disapproved of
that resolution, if you had heard it ?—Per-
haps I might.

Sv I should have supposed—you know Mr.
Yorke ?—I do.

Was he a Sheffield man ?—I believe not.
a brought him to Shefficld P—I cannot

_Had you much acquaintance with him?—
No anu previous to his first coming
to'Sheftield.

You knew a great deal of him, I believe,
after he did come?—I frequently have heard
him speak in private, and in public.

You were very intimate with him, were not
you?—I cannot say I was very intimate.

Were you very often with him in private ?—

was,

Having been very often with him in private,
you and he had both the same opinion about
obtaining a reform by peaceable means?—I
cannot say we had altogether.

What was the difference between you ?—I
cannot recollect exactly ; with respect to a re-
form in parliament, we differed in many other
circumstances respecting political matters, but
with respect to the specific difference I cannot
at nt recollect.

Do you know who the editors of the Pa-
triot were ?—I do not.

Upon your oath do not you?—I do not.

Did you never bear who were the editors




of that paper ?—No, I never did, only what
public report has said; I never heard who
were but merely by public rumour.

Did you ever hear by public rumour, or
otherwise, who were the editors of the Pa-
triot ?—I have heard it said that certain pers
sons were editors of the Patriot.

Who did you hear it said were editors of
the Patriot?—Mr. Brown was mentioned as
one person.

Do you know Mr. Brown’s hand-writing
when you see it ?—I believe I do. .

Mr. Brown was your delegate to the con-
vention, was not he ?---[fe was.

He was a peaceable well-disposed man ?-—
We believed so. |

Do youremember your society having any
communication with a society at Steckport ?—-
Letters have occasiunally passed.

Have you seen their letters in your society ?
---I have seen some letters, but do not parti-
cularly recollect any of them.

They were also peaceably disposed, and as-
sociated for the same end as yourself, no
doubt ?---We believed so.

Tell me whether that {showing the witness
a letter] is Mr. Campbell Brown’s hand-writ-
ing or not, according to your belief?--I be-
lieve it is.

You know upon the Castle-hill, that theré
was a motion made to petition the House of
Commons ?---Yes.

Upon your oath were you in the secret that
that motion was made, by contrivance, to bé
negatived ?---I was not.

0 you know it now?---I know it by seeing
it mentioned in the public papers.

You know it no otherwise ?---I have heard
it spoken of generally among people that
they supposed so.

At the time you attended the meeting, you
did not know that that was a contrivance ?—I
did not.

And many hundred others of you, I suppose,
did not ?---I belicve so.

David Martin re-examined by Mr. Erskine,

When you say the motion was negatived
for petitioning parliament, do you mean to
say it was negatived to petition parliament
ultimately by the delegates, when they got
the sense of a larger body of the people ?---I
understood the not petitioning parliament,
applicd to the present parliament, the present
House of Commons. :

Whatever Mr. Brown Campbell, or Mr.
Campbell Brown might write, or whatever he
might think, or whatever he might do---did
your socicty give him any authority to act for
you at. Edinburgh, except in a legal and con-
stitutional manner ?-—By no means.

Ido not care whether he acted legally or
not, but did your society Li? him authority,
confining ‘him within the limits of legal and
constitutional behaviour ?-—They certainly did.

Would you have consented to the sending
of himto Edinburgh, if youhad oclieved that

3T

he would have transgressed the rules of law?
--I would not.

You might be mistaken undoubtedly ; but
I wish to know whether you acted with the
intention that you have stated to us ?e—I cer-
tainly did.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—-Were the pro-
ceedings at the Castle-hill published ?—-They

were.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.--- Was Mr, Yorke’s
speech published likewise?---Yes; the pro-
ceedings, including the principal part of Mr.
Yorke’s speech.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Do you mean
that speech ?—-The speech which was after-
wards published.

Mr. Erskine.—Which has been read in
court? -

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—And you have
read that speech ?—-Yes, I have seen it.

Edward Oakes sworn—Examined by Mr.
Erskine.

What are you ?---A plater.

An inhabitant of Sheffield ?---Yes.

A housekeeper there?—I am not a house-
Keeper; I live with my father.

What is your father ?—-A grocer.

Were you a member of the society ?---I
was.

From what time to what time ?—I think
from the year 1791, to the present time.

Did you attend frequently the meetings of
the society ?—Yes, I did.

Did you attend them what might be called
regularly ?---I did in the general; I was not
at every meeting.

But _in the general you were a good atten-

dant?—Yes.
_ What was your object ?---My object in join-
ing the society was this; if by lawful and
constitutional means, in co-operation with the
rest of my brethren, we might be able to
gain a reform in parliament.

How did you expect that that co-operation
with the rest of your brethren would produce
that consequence ?--We expected that our pe-
‘titions would be heard.

Did you expect more effect from petitions
which might afterwards be presented, under a
delegation from large bodies, than might be
procured by the petitions of a small number?
=- Yes,

Did you consider that such petitions from
delegates of large bodies of people, were more
likely to impress parliament with the policy
and justice of the measure ?—~I did.

Was it your intention, as far as you must be
acquainted with your own objects, if you were
disappointed in the effect which you expected,
to use force or violence:

Mr. Attorney-General.-—Please to ask him
what his intention was. :

Mr. Erskine.---Be so good as to hear the
question out, Ido not like to be interrupted
in the middle ofa question.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—You have not


asked the witness one question yet which hes
not been irregular.

{1012

Mr. Erskine. How am I toask a witness a

question, touching a particular point, without
leading him, in some measure? I do not
mean to put the answer in his mouth; [ will
pursue the question in the very
going to do, and will argue it with the gentle-

incn.

Mr. Erskine.—Then it is not worth inter-

tupting mein this way. If the ge the

not have been attended with effect, wasit
your object to use force?—No, never.

ted, should

Would you have remained in the society, if

you had had any reason to believe that thit
was the object of others ?—I would not.

. From what passed in the society, when yu

were present at their meetings, what did
rolleck to be their object oT never ine.
stood that the object of the society, as a body,
or as individuals, was any thing more thana
seform in parliament; dnd they did not, a
far as I knew of them, desire, in the least, to
gain this object by any other means than by
petitioning parliament.

Were you present, upon the Castle hill,

when a petition to parliament was rej
and a petition to the king put in the room of
it?-—I was.

When that petition to the House of Com

mons, was negatived for the present, wasit
determined, at no future time, to petition par

liament, when ‘you had got the sense of 8
larger body of people?

ton Chief Justice Eyre—Do you koow
what the terms of the resolution were ?—I 0
not recollect at present.

Mr. Erskine.—Ilis lordship, I suppose, does
not ask as to the words, but if you the
substance of it?---I do not know that the
solution was, stating that parliament
never be petitioned again. ;

Did it refer to that time, or to all times?-~
I rather think it’ pasticulasly referred to thst
time only.

Were you in the society at the time whet
it was proposed to send a delegate to
land ?--Yes, I was. .

Did the proposition to have a convent
in Scotland, and to have delegates sent to ih
come to your society from Scotland, of
you send to it?---I do not recollect.

When you sent your delegate, what 73
the object of the society, as far as you
edit from what you heard upon the oc
sion; I am not asking your ideas and novow
in sending Mr. Brown to Edinburgh i—The
object of the society, as far as I knew of, a
sending Matthew Campbell Brown to Bd
burgh, was, in order that proper m q
might be considered of, for the purpo* °
gaining a reform. in parliament. we

Was Matthew, Campbell Brown, 88
gate from your society, to express the
which your society had ?---He was.


Was it the object of your society that your,
delegate should express your idea ?—It was ;
I dare say our delegate would have been re-
called from the convention, if any other ob-
ject had been proposed

Was he directed to pursue the object which
the society expressed ?—He was.

When the delegates, from the different so-
cieties had got together, what were they to
do ?-—-They were to point out the proper way
of addressing parliament unknown to us.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Did you say un-
known to us?---Of addressing parliament in a
constitutional way, that might not altogether
be thought upon by us; we thought them
persons more capable of judging of the most
effectual way of addressing parliament than
ourselves.

Mr. Erskine.—What effect did you consider
might be produced by having delegates as-
sembled, peaceably, from very large bodies of
people—what effect did you contemplate that
would have with parliament ?-—We supposed
that petitions coming from so respectable a
body as we thought them, would have consi-
derable weight with parliament.

Did you think that petitions, coming from
delegates, from a great body of people, would
have more effect than a petition from a small
body ?—We did.

Did you contemplate that, by the pursuit of
the same peaceable means, parliament might
ultimately yield, from a sense of justice, to
your wishes?—That was our ultimate expec-
tation.

From any thing that passed in your society,
was there any thing in contemplation against
the king?—Not against the king.

Against his title, or office ? ~ Nothing
against his title, or office, or life.

Was any thing said, when the delegate was
sent to Scotland, concerning the House of
Lords?—I do not particularly recollect whe-
ther there was or no.

Did the object of your society extend far-
ther than the representation of the people in
the House of Commons ?—I believe not.

When did you first hear, what we have
heard a good deal of in this court, of any arms,
or pikes ? —I do not particularly recollect the
time ; it was a few months back.

Just a little before Mr. Camage was taken
up, was not it?—Not long before.

Do you recollect whether the society, or
any part of it, had been insulted, or threaten-
ed?—Yes, I recollect very well, the society
had very great apprehensions of danger from
the opposite party, because the opposite party

given them cause to fear, by their re-
peated threats to the society, and by the ill
usage that some of the membersof the society
had met with from them. :

Do you mean, by the opposite party, the
Magistrates?—No, by no means the magis-
trates, but individuals, who took upon them-
selves an authority which we thought they
had no right to.” ;


(1014
Do you recollect whether that was com-,
plained of in the society, and whether any

danger was thought of ?—It was complained
of in the society, as a thing that was thought
by the society not right.

Task you, upon your most solemn oath,
whether there was ever any thing passed in
the society, for arming it as a body, for an at-"
tack upon the government of the country ?—
I am sensible in whose presence I now stand,
and I desire to speak the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth; and, in
the presence of God, I can ay affirm,
upon my oath, that that never was designed,
never agitated, and, I believe, never thought
of in the society, to arm as a body, to attack
government.

If any such idea had ever occurred to any
wicked man, or wicked men, in your society,
have reason to believe that you should
have known it?—I should.

I do not ask you what any wicked man, in.
his own private mind, might have intended,
but if it had been the object of your society,
or any number of them, do you believe yu
should have known it?—I believe I should.

Edward Oakes cross-examined by Mr. Bower,

Be so good as to remember, when you an-_
swer my questions, that you have spoken
about the solemnity of your oath—You have
been a member of the Sheffield Society, you
say, from the year 1791?—I have.

Have you been intimately acquainted with
the proceedings of that society ?—Yes.

You stated that, I think >—Yes. '

Had you a committee of members of your.
society, who managed for the society ?—Yes.

Were you a member of that committee ?—

es.

Were you there at the time when twelve’
members were sent, or intended to be sent,
from the Constitutional Society at Sheffield,
to the Constitutional Society in London?—I
never was present when any such thing was
ever proposed, :

Do you not know, in fact, you that were
intimate with all the proceedings of the so-
ciety, that twelve members were deputed
from Sheffield, to be elected members of the
Constitutional Society, in London?

Oakes.—To be elected members P

Mr. Bower.—-Yes?--I do not know that I
was present.

If you mean to turn any thing upon the
word elected,—to be sent, to have a commu-
nication with them ?

Oukes.—To be deputed, to be sent from Shef=
field to them ?

- Mr. Bower.---Yes?—No, I never was at any
meeting where there was such a proposition
made.

Were they to be associated, any of your
members with the society in London ?—I do
not know that they were, in any wise, to he’
associated to them, any farther than by cor-
respondence,

Were they then to be associated by corres-
pondence ?—In order to co-operate with each
other, for the purposes I have mentioned.

Were you there then, when it was agreed,
or settled, that twelve members of your s0-
ciety should be associated with the Landon
society, for the purpose of correspondence ?—
I do not recollect whether I was or nat.

. Did you never hear in the committee, that
such a step had been agreed upon ?—I cannot
particularly answer to that.

I beg you would recollect yourself, whether
you do not recollect that such a circumstance

appencd; do you meun to say it did not
happen ?—I do, by no means, wish to insinu-
ate that it did not happen; but ] do not re-
collect whether there was any such proposi-
tion made.

Do you not believe the fact, that such per-
sons were associated ?—I do not believe that
there was. :

. Do you know, whether. any proposal that
was mnade about associating members of your
society, came from London, or was at first
Propet from Sheffield ?—Indeed I do not

now.

Did you constantly attend the committecs ?
—I did not.

_ And you never heard, either before or after
such a measure, that it had actually taken
place ?—I did not.

_ Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Did your com-
mittee take your proceedings down in writing?

Sometimes.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Did they keep a
regular account?—Not a regular account.

Mr. Lower.—What are become of those
proceedings that were put into writing at
those committees ?—Indeed, I am perfectly
a stranger to them; for at the time the per-
sons were apprehended and taken from shef-
field to Londen, I did not, at that moment, or
at that time, attend the committee; so that I
cannot answer for any thing that the commit-
tee did in my absence.

Tn whose custody were the proceedings that
were put into writing usually kept ?—By Wil-
liam Broomhead.

You said, you expected your petitions would
be heard; were you present, when that reso-
lution passed which we have been talking of,
when it was resolved not to petition parlia-
mont any more ?—I was.

Were you present when any letter was
written from the Conmuvaonah Society at
Shellield, to the Society for Constitutional In-
formation at London, respecting a radical re-
forin of the country, the 14th of March 1792;
that is long subsequent to the time of your
Lecoming a member ?—Unless I was to kaow
the contents of the letter I cannot speak.

I will show it you; do you know a man of
the name of Sarouel Ashton ?—Yes.

Was he an active member of your society ?
—He was at the first period of it.

Up to what period ?—J do not know.

Where is he now ?—Indeed I do Bet kaew.


| ton’s hand-writing; I am going to call a vie

(1016

Ishe at Sheffield?—I apprehend not; |
believe he is somewhere in the country.

Did he correspond with the London Cor.
responding Society, in the name of the She-
field Society ?—Yes.

Is that letter [showing it to the witness]
Ashton’s hand-writing?—I cannot answer
to it.

You must have seen him write frequeally
in the society?--When he was an active
member of the society, I was not an active
member. .

Have you never seen Ashton write, upca
the solemn oath to which you have appealed?
—I never saw him write any letter to ay
correspondent.

Have you seen him write upon any sub
ject ?---T do not recollect whether I haveo
not; I have seen him write, but not to ea
mine his writing.

Mr. Erskine.---¥ou may take it to be Ask

ness to prove Ashton’s hand-writing.

Mr. Bower,—What is Samuel Ashton}—I
believe he was orginally a painter.

What is he now?—I suppose now he bis
obtained a patent, for the purpose of tanning
leather.

You do not know where he is now?---1d
not.

You may look at the contents of that letter,
and tell me, whether you know of that letter
being sent to London

[The witness reads the letter.]

Now you have read that letter; upon your
oath, do you know of that letter being sent
to London ?---I cannot answer to that.

Do you believe you did; I will try yu
first in that way, because I advise you, that
we know more of this than you are aware of,
and therefore be cautious ; upon your oath, it
the first place, do you believe, or not, thet®
was sent?—-At the time that this letter was
wrote, I was not an active member, por #-
mitted into their meetings.

Did you at any time after you becamea
member, know that that letter had beea
written?—The letters were not altogether
known to the society at large: therefore 1am
not able to answer. ;

There is one thing in which you arc wa:
curate; but I do not want to surprise you;

ou stated in your examination, that you ha
been a member of this society in 1794; this
letter is dated the 14th of March 1799, and of
course must be written at the time you were
a member ?—Yes,

Then though you had been a member from
1791 to March 1792, you did not know of that
letter being written?—We as a body, 3
pointed representatives for us; and there!
we entrusted to them to transact our busines,
as they kuew our views. .

Was any report ever made to the society,
what the committees had been deing?--- te
at times there were. ;

About what periods; once. a fortwighh®


montb, three months, or at about what inter-
vals?—Sometimes they were often made, and
sometimes not. ~

What was the time that was oftenest-.-was
it oncea eck ?~-Na.

Once a fortnight?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre-—Had you any
fixed time?—We had not.

Mr. Bower.---Upon your oath, do you ever
remember a report being made of the proceed-
ings about the period of the 14th of March,
1792 ?---Indeed, 1 am not able to answer to
that; I cannot recollect.

You say, in that letter, that it is upon the
pede of the Rights of Man; had those

woks been received in your society as the
principles upon which you were to act,
Paine’s Rights of Man ?—They had been intro-
duced into the society before they were proved
to be a libel.

Your pwnciples, however, that you state,
are the right to a thorough reformation-.-a
radical returm of the country, upon a system
consistent with the rights of man. Were the
rights of man described in that book and this
Ietter ?---I do not know whether this letter
particularly means the Rights of Man, as
particularly wrote by Mr. Paine.

Mr. Attorney General.—-Read up that sen-
tence : “ Jf the Society for Constitutional In-
formation in London, should vouchsafe so far
to notice us, as to enter into a connexion and
correspondence with us, it cannot fail of pro-
moting honour, and adding strength to our
feeble endeavours, and to the common cause,
which is the entire motive we have in view.”

Mr. Erskine.—Begin at the beginning, and
read the whole letter.---The gentlemen of the

Jhiry will be so guod as to take down the date
of this letter; it is the 14th of March, 1792,

Mr. Attorney General—-That is put the let-

ter we meant; but you may read that.

Mr. toaer.— this is not the paper that Iam

examining to; but 1 have no objection in the |

world to his reading it.
Mr. Erskine—I1 have no wish to consume

the time of the Court ; 1 only wish the jury |

to take down that date, the 14th of March,

1792, because I havea witness to call in a few |

minutes.
ade. Bower.—As you desire to have it read,

let the witness read it aloud, [The witness !

read the letter aloud.]

“ Sir ;---It is now abouts four months since
this society farst formed itself into a regular
body, then but very few in number; the

enclosed will inform you of their increase, |

and which, is most probable, will soon be-
come* very numerous ; and notonly this large
and populous town, but the whole neighbour-
hood, tor many miles round about, have an
attentive eye upun us; most of the towns
and vallages, indeed, are furming themsclves


to good order and regularity, and the need

we have of coasulting and communicating

with those who are sincere friends, and able

advocates for the same cause; for these rea-

sons, we took the liberty of writing ta Mr.

Horne Tvoke, that worthy friend and patriot

of our earnest desires of entering into a cen-'
nexion with the society of the same denomi-
nation with ours in London: His very oblig-

the liberty, herewith to transmit to you some
resolves, which were passed at our last meet-
ings by the whole body; and the committee
was charged with the dispatch of printing, and
forwarding them to you accordingly, for the
purpose of submitting them to the considera-

them as they think most prudent.

they applied to us, about two munths ago, for

letter.}—-It is the same date, the 14th of
March, 1792; Sheffield Society for Constitu-
tional Information, to the Society for Consti-
tutional Information, in London.

Who is it directed to on the other side ?—
There is no direction on it.

Mr. Erskine.—It is necessary the jury
should know, as you go on, that this is not
new matter; thatit is matter which has been
proved before.

Mr. Bower.—Certainly.—Is that the hand-
writing of Mr. Ashton ?-—-I cannot answer to
his hand-writing in any respect.

Do you believe it to be his hand-writing?
-—I am not acquainted with his hand-writing.

You have seen him write?—But not to no-
tice his hand-writing.

Mr. Erskine—I am going to prove his
hand-writing, as I stated before.

[The witness reads it aloud.]

“ Gentlemen ;—This Society, feeling as
they do, the grievous effects of the present cor-
rupt state defects, and abuse of our country ;
the great and heavy oppressions which the
common mass of the people labour under, as
the natural consequence of that corruption ;
and at the same time being sensible, toa de-
gree of certainty, that the public minds, and
general sentiments of the people, are deter-
mined to obtain, A RADICAL REFORM OF
THE COUNTRY, as soon as prudence and
discretion will permit, believes it their duty to
make use of every prudent means, as far as
their abilities can be extended, to obtain so
salutary and desirable an object as a thorough
reformation of our country. For these rea-
sons, with great deference and submission to
the members of the Society for Constitutional
Information in London, we beg leave to re-
quest that they will be pleased to admit the
persons of the following names annexed hereto
as members of their society (they being our
friends, and members of our society), in order
that a close connexion may be formed, and a
regular communication maintained, between
the two bodies ; that, being thus strengthened
this society may be better enabled to govern
itself with more propriety, and to render assis-
tance to their fellow-citizens in this neigh-
bourhood, and in parts more remote ; that
they, in their turn, may extend useful know-
ledge still farther, from town to village, and
from village to town, until the whole nation
be sufficiently enlightened, and united in the
same cause, which cannot fail of being the
case wherever the most excellent works of
Mr. Thomas Paine find residence. I am,
gentlemen, your most respectful and sincere
triend.—By order of the committee,

“ SAMUEL ASHTON,
Secretary for this society.”

Mr. Bower.—In that part where it says—
“the people are determined to obtain a radi-

word originally, where the word country is
now ?-—I do not know ; it is not intelligible.

Do you know how those two letters of te
same date came to be sent on the same day?
—No, I do not.

Did you ever hear of this letter, which I
have now desired you to read, before it was
written, or afterwards ?—I do not recollectit

Do you not recollect hearing of that leter
at all P---I do not.

That was a letter then composed by the s-
cret committee, which never was commun-
cated to you, at least ?

Oakes.—-By the secret committee ?

Mr. Bower.—By the committee ?—It never
was.

It never was comm inicated, to your know
ledge, to the society ?—-I do not know, te-
cause I did not attend all the society's
meetings.

I ask whether, to your knowledge, it ever
was communicated to the society ?—I cannet
answer to that.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Do you know
whether it was, or was not?—I do not know
whether it was, or not.

Mr. Bower.---You say you were present at
the meeting at the Castle-hill ?—I was.

Did you hear Yorke’s speech there ?—Yes.

Have you read it since it was printed?—I
have not.

Have you never read his speech ?—No; I
have not.

Did you know Mr. Brown ?---Yes.

Was he the editor of the Patriot, I mes
the gentleman sent as alee Matthee
Campbell Brown ?--I do not know.

Did you ever read a paper at Sheffield under
he name of the Patriot?

jakes—Do you mean a newspaper, or 3
book which calor outin numbers?

T believe it came out both ways; did you
ever read either of them?-—J have read fre-
quently the register, which might contain ex-
tracts from the Patriot, Mr. Gale’s register.

Did you read the book that was published
under the title of the Patriot ?—I read seve-
ral of them.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—What was the
title of the register ?—The Sheffield Register.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—A newspaper,
published weekly ?-—Yes.

Mr. Bower.—Look at the resolutions in the
printed paper pasted into that book.

Oakes.—Will you give me leave to read
them over?

Mr. Erskine—Do you temember that
paper ; do you know any thing of it ?—I cam-
Dot tell.

Mr. Bower.—Read it over aloud ; it bas
been read already.

Mr. Erskine.—That is a very good ressoa
why he need not read it aloud again.

[The witness read it over to himself.]
Mr. Bower.—Now, upon your oath, were’

those resolutions, or ques copies of them,
circulated at Sheffield as the resolutions of
your society ?—Yes; I believe they were.

You have seen them in circulation there;
have you not ?—I think so?

Did you at that time, or your society, cir-
culate the books which are referred to in those
resolutions—I mean this part, “ we declare
that we have derived more true knowledge
from the two works of Mr. Thomas Paine, in-
tituled,Rights of Man, part the first and second
than from any other author on the subject—
the practice, as well as the principle of go-
vernment, is laid down in those works in a
manner so clear and irresistibly convincing,
that this society do hereby resolve to give
their thanks to Mr. Paine for his two said
publications, intituled Rights of Man, part the
first and second”?—Never since they were
proved to be a libel.

Iam not talking about their being proved
to bea libel, but whether these books were
circulated by your society, about Sheffield, as
the principles of government which you had,
adopted?—They were, before they were
proved to be a libel.

Were they circulated by the members of
your society, in the neighbourhood of Shef-
tield, in very great numbers ?—Indeed I can-
not answer that.

Do you know that they were circulated by
the members of that society at all?—Yes;
He were, before they were proved to be a

ibel.

I beg it to be understood that the question
has nothing todo with proved to be a libel ;
but were they not, in fact, circulated ?—They
were sold to various persons, both in the town
and country.

By whom ; by Gale?—I do not know whe-
ther Gale sold any or not ; I believe he did. -

By whom, do you know, were they circu-
lated—were they circulated by the members
of that society, to your knowledge ?—Yes.

ho was this David Martin, who signs
those resolutions as chairman of your commit-
tee ?—He was not constantly chairman.

Was he, at the time those resolutions pas-
sed ?—I do not know that I was present when
they were passed.

Did you not know the time till asked you
to the time now?—Yes; I knew they were
circulated as such.

Did you not know he was chairman ?—I
knew it by his name being to the minutes.

How many members had you about this
time in the Constitutional Society ?—I do not
know.

Do you mean to say you do not know
whether there were twenty-five hundred, or
ten thousand ?—I cannot answer to the par-
ticular number of the society.

As near as you can?—I do not wish to
speak any thing but the truth.

As Mear as you can ?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Give short, clear
distinct answers; that is the way to convince
every body that you speak the truth,


Mr. Erskine.—They are asking the number
of members, at a distinct period of time, in a
society the numbers af which were fluc-
tuating.

Mr. Bower.—About how many ?—Probably
there might be about two hundred.

How came you to say, in your resolutions,
that they were increased to nearly two thow-
sand, if they were only two hundred?—There
were many that were friends to the plans that
we were proposing and adopting, that were
not regularly entered into the society as
members.

You begin by stating, “ This society, com
posed chiefly of the manufacturers of Sheffield,

egan about four months ago, and is already
increased to nearly two thousand members,
and is daily increasing ;” was not that fifteen,
sixteen, or eighteen hundred more than you
had at the time?—Probably that might be
taken from the number of people that attended
the meeting at that time.

Did people attend the meetings who were
not members ?—Yes, at the first beginning.

Had you any meeting at which five hus-
dred persons were got together, before the
month of March, 1792?—I believe there
were.

I observed, when you were examined, you
said you had no intention to attack govern-
ment; what did you mean that you had no
intention to attack government; if govern-
ment had attacked you, and dispersed you,
what were you to do?—We had no designs at
all to attack government by force of arms.

Supposing government had attempted to
disperse you?—We should have submitted
to it,

You do not know, you said, whether there
wasany intentionatall aboutaltering the House
of Lords, or about the House of Lords in any
respect ?—We expected a fair and equal re-
presentation in the House of Commons; that
if there were any corruptions in the House of
Lords, that a reformation of that would follow
of course.

Then, after all you have stated to me of
those resolutions, and those works you have
before stated, you mean now to state that
your idea was a mere reform by petition to
parliament, and nothing more?—It was.

Was Martin, the person who signed this,
the last witness ?—Yes.

Edward Oakes re-examined by Mr. Erskine,

You said, when you had obtained an equal
representation in the House of Commons, if
there was any corruption in the House of
Lords, a reformation there would follow of
course—do you mean that that would follow,
in consequence of an act of parliament made
by the King, the Lords, and the House of
Commons, restored to its purity, as you
wished it?—Yes. .

Mr. Bower.—That is a leading question.

Mr. Erskine.—Though there was no fixed
time for your committee’s reporting what

pessed before them, whether reports were
not made from time to time, and all the pro-
cecdings published in the papers?—I believe
there were.

Was there any concealment of what you
did ?—I believe there was not.

Were not the letters, which you have heard
read in court here, from time to time, printed
in the newspapers at the time?—I cannot
answer for that.

But did you not advertise frequently in the
newspapers, the procecdings and letters that
you had ?—I believe the proceedings of the
society were, in general, published in the
newspapers,

Mr. Bower.—Did that book, called the Pa-
triot, come out about the same time as the
newspaper ?—Tine newspapers came out long
before the Patrivt.

Mr. Daniel Stuart called again.

Mr. Erskine —1I call this gentleman, who
has been examined before, in consequence of
the evidence which your lordship has now
been attending to; this gentleman is secre-
tary to the Friends of the People, in Frith-
street, London, whose proccedings are before
the Court. Have you any letter from the
Sheffield Society, signed Samuel Ashton ?—I
have. [produces it.

lad the Society of the Friends of the Peo-
ple, at that time, published their Declaration;
icallit our Declaration, being myself a mem-
ber of that society ?—Yes, they had.

Mr, Luw.— What is the date ?

Mr. Erskine. —The 14th of May, 1792.
At what time did the Society of the Friends
of the People first institute themselves, and
publish their Declaration; have you one
about you ?—I have; here—[producing it]—
it is the proceedings of the society, printed
under my own inspection.

Does this letter refer to this address ?—It
docs.

Mr. Erskine,—We will read the letter first,
and then the address.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre. — What is the
date of the Declaration you speak of?

Mr. Ersktne.—The title of it is—“ A De-
claration, agreed to on the 11th of April, 1792,
by the Society, intituled, The Friends of the
People, associated for the purpose of obtain-
ing a Parliamentary Reform.”

Lord Chicf Justice Eyre. — When pub-
lished?

Mr. Stuart —Very soon after.

Mr. Erskine—It was transmitted to Ash-

ton; and this letter is the answer of Ashton |

upon the receipt of it.
[It was read by Mr. Erskine.]

“ DECLARATION, agreed to on the 11th
of April, 1792, by the Society, entitled, j
Tue Frrenps oF Tue Peopis, associated |
for the purpose of obtaining a PartiaMEN-
Tary Rerorm,

“ A number of persons, having seriously

reviewed and considered the actual situstia
of public affairs, and state of the kingdoa,
and having communicated to each othcr ther
opinions on these subjects, have agreed ad
determined tu institute a suciety, for the pa
pose of proposing to parliament and to tk
country, and of promoting, to the utmost d
their power, the following constitutional ob
jects, making the preservation of the cont.
tution, on its true principles, the founda
of all their proceedings.

« First, To restore the freedom of electxa,
and a more equal representation of the pe
ple in parliament.

“ Secondly, ‘To secure to the people a mor
frequent exercise of their right of elecus
their representatives.

“ The persons who have signed their names
to this agreement, think, that these two fu-
damental measures, will furnish the port
and the means of correcting the abuses, whe)
appear to them to have arisen from a neglect
of the acknowledged principles of the cc
stitution, and of accomplishing those sus-
dinate objects of reform, which they deem t
be essential to the liberties of the people, ani
to the good government of the kingdom.

this, and similat reasons, we are induced to
take the liberty of troubling you with the
above and following sketch :—Our associating,

we have the satisfaction, with truth, to affirm,
that not the least disorder, or confusion, hath

mity, peace, and concord. As our members
increase, the number of meeting places are
increased in proportion, so as not to exceed at
most thirty members at one place. All the
circular meetings are held. once a fortnight,
on the same evening ; our general meeting is
held once a month, at three different houses,
on the same day, generally very crowded, De
good order and regularity is strictly attended
to :—and we doubt not, but what has been
suggested to be impossible, will be fully mani-

great deference to that honourable society, to

© Sir;—We beg leave to acknowledge the
receipt of your letter, of the 14th instant, and
to return you our thanks for a confident
which, we trust, our future conduct will mest
from our country.

“We have received sincere pleasure,
only from the firm and virtuous tone in which
you have spoken your principles, but from te
wise and temperate manner in which yo
have limited their application to practice—
We rejoice ‘that our sentiments, our D>
* tives, and our plans of reform are perfectly it
‘unison with your ideas.’ The great body of
the people corresponding to such ‘sea
‘ ments’ will equally confound the two opposilt
classes of enemies to the public weal; thatit
will defeat the hopes of those who would due
the people into tumult, and that it will slee
the slanders of those advocates of corruption,
who haye laboured to render the caus

Jiberty odious and terrible to all good citizens,
by confounding it with principles of anarchy,
end by Joading it with the obloquy of pro-
voking civil commotion, and of en angering
the destruction of @ constitution justly NG
nowned for the freedom and happiness whic!
it has so long bestowed. You are pleased to
say that ‘ you look up to the Friends of the
‘ People as your leaders and directors in this
€ great business :’ authorized as we feel our-
selves by this proffered guidance, and by that
harmony of sentiment, which from the tenor
of your letter, we must suppose to exist be-
tween you and ourselves, permit us to lay be-
fore you some ideas which are dictated by
zeal for our common cause. The cause of
liberty can never be endangered by the assault
of its enemies, but may sometimes be exposed
by the indiscretion of its friends; its prin-
ciples are fourded on impregnable reason,
and its enemies are, therefore; too dexterous
directly, to attack them. It is not against the
reasonings of the champions of corruption
(for they have produced none), but it is against
their craft and their misrepresentation that
we have found it necessary to defend our-
selves by the wariness of our language and
our conduct. A similar wariness, as far as
the authority of our opinion can extend, we
must counsel all societies associated on simi-
lar principles, for the accomplishment of the
same object, to preserve; accused as they are,
in common with ourselves, of meditating one
object and holding forth another, of seducing
the people by a measure so specious and salu-
tary as parliamentary reform, into other mea-
sures of desperate tendency and undefinable
extent, we can only advise them to follow
our example in honestly, and solemnly de-
claring that ‘ they make the preservation of
“the constitution, on its true principles, the
“foundation of all their proceedings’ and the
measure of all their reforms.—Language thus

tations to which, perhaps, ardent indiscretion
may have sometimes furnished pretexts. An
early declaration of these opinions, which we
sincerely believe you to entertain, will con-
ciliate: many to the cause of a reform who are
now held in honest neutrality by their fears,
The friends of order, aftcr sucha declaration,
justified by consistent conduct, will be no
lonver driven to seek refuge from anarchy in
the bosom of corruption. The interested
supporters of the present abuses will thus be
disarmed, for it is only by confounding reform

British constitution, that they are enabled ta

our language, as you will perceive from the
roceedings which we transmit to you, has
m cautious, because al) our views are mo-
derate ;—we are persuaded that you have a
similar moderation of views, and we earnestly
exhort you to a similar caution in language.
*¢ It is only, indeed, with Societies, who
express the same ration of principles,


and adopt thé same wariness of language,
that this society can entertain any correspon-
dence, or promise any co-operation ; we have
publicly disclaimed what we condemn, as
well as avowed our real object, and on an
occasion unsought for by us. In conformity
with this principle we have. been compelled
to decline all intercourse with the Society for
Constitutional Information in London; for
though we never wish to attack, nor pretend
to.dictate, we are certainly entitled to decline
all intercoyrse with men whose views and
principles appear to us irreconcileable with
ottrs.

“On the particular measure which you
suggest for collecting the opinion of the peo-
ple on the subject of reform, we do not feel
ourselves yet prepared to decide; in a more
advanced stage of the business it may become
very fit matter for deliberation.

“Permit us, sir, to conclude with congra~
tulating you and congratulating our coun-
try, on the admirable principles which your
letter contains, and on the intrepid modera~
tion which it entitles us to expect from you:
you will deprive our enemies of every pretext
for counterfeiting alarms which they do not
feel, and of every opportunity to defeat our
measures by calumniating our intentions.
(In name, and by order of the committee,)

(Signed) “ C. Grey, chairman.

“To Samuel Ashton, esq. secre-
tary to the Society for Consti-
ei Information, in Shef-

eld.”

Mr. Erskine.—Have you any letter re-
ceived from the Hertfordshire Society ?—Yes.

Is that the letter? [showing it to the wit-
ness.]—This is the letter, dated October 1st,
1792.

Was it read to the Society ?—It was.

Mr. Erskine.—The clerk will now read this
letter. :

Mr. Attorney General—We have not”
named that Society.

Mr. Erskine.—I do not give up my right
to read it. I will argue it by-and-by.

Mr. Daniel Stuart, cross-examined by Mr.
Attorney Gencral.

The letter that has last been read you say’
you took to Mr. Grey to be signed ?—Yes.

It was signed?—Yes.

Did you send the letter by the post, or de-
liver it yourself to Mr. Ashton ?—I sent it by
the post to Sheffield.

Did you know Mr. Ashton?—Not perso-
nally then.

Do you know what Mr. Ashton is?—Yes;-
a currier, or tanner, I believe, .

What was he at that time ?—I suppose in’
the same business, I have no doubt he was.

I see you direct to Samuel Ashton, esq.?—

es. ;
ThatI suppose was a thought of your own?
It was not.

By whose direction did you direct it to
Samuel Ashton, esq.?—By the direction of
the committee.

Did any of them know Mr. Ashton’s situa-
tion in life?—I believe none of them knew
Mr. Ashton at that time.

You told us the other day, when you were
here, that you did not know that Mr. Hardy
had been an associated member of the Con-
stitutional Society ?—I did not.

jou sce your letter is of the 24th of May?
—Yes,

Do you know, that the same Mr. Ashton,
upon the 26th of the same month, wrote to
the Constitutional Society, in London, a
letter, which I hold now in my hand, stating,
that he had received your moderate letter,
the letter of the Friends of the People; an
stating, to that Society, that, as your princi-
ples were not according to the rights of man,
the Sheffield Society would have nothing ‘to
do with you, except so far as the Constitu-
tional Society would afterwards permit?—I
never heard of such a letter before.

Have you had any communication with Mr.
Ashton since?—About a twelvemonth ago
Mr. Ashton was in town, and called upon me.

A short time previous to this, I think about
the 27th of March, your Society, the Friends
of the People, had expressed their reasons for
having nothing to do with the Constitutional
Society; and had stated to them, that the
would have no more correspondence with
them?—I think that was about the begin-
ning of May.

It was before this letter of your's to Shef-
field ?—It was.

Did you know, that twelve members of
that very Sheffield Society, to which you were
writing, had been associated with the Consti-
tutional Society, whose correspondence you
had before rejected?—I am not sure; I had
read it in the newspapers; but I cannot say
certainly whether I knew it or not.

Do you mean to say, that, at the time you
permitted this letter to go from the Friends
of the People, to Sheffield, that you knew
that that Sheffield Society had twelve mem-
bers associated with that Constitutional So-
ciety, with whom your Society had refused
to correspond ?—At the time of sending that
answer, I did not think ofany such thing.

T do not mean to insinuate that you did,
for I do not believe that you did—then, you
did not know that fact?—No; but, I believe,
T heard of it afterwards.

You observed my learned friend read to
you a great many very respectable names;

ow many of those gentlemen have quitted
your society ?—I suppose about a dozen.

Mr. Ersliva.-— and you can tell how many
have been added to it ?

Mr, Attorney General.—Your society re-
ceived this letter of the 14th, from Sheffield,
as a proof of their moderation?—Yes.

And you treated it so, of course, and knew
nothing of the letter that, on the 26th of May,


{1032

they wrote to the Constitutional Society,
such as I have been stating to you ?—No;I
did not.

You were going to state, that some gentle.
men had left your society about this time?—
Yes; there were.

Do you recollect the names of them?~
Five gentlemen left the society at once ; their
letter is printed in those proceedings; Mr.
Baker, lord John Russell, Mr. Courtenay,
Mr. Dudley North, and Mr. Curwen.

Have you had the curiosity to read over the
names of those respectable gentlemen, whose
names are printed jn this list Certainly.

Can you inform me how many of those

entlemen were, and continue to be mem
ie of that Constitutional Society, all corre
pondence with which you had rejected?-[
can only know from hearsay.

Mr. Erskine.—You will state the names—
I believe Mr. Goring is, but he bas withdrawn
frem the Friends of the People.

Dr. Towers is a member of the Friends of
the People, and the Constitutional Society ?—
Yes.

Major Cartwright?—Yes.

Mr. Batley?—I do not know that Mr.
Batley, senior.

Mr. Thompson ?—Yes.

Mr. Walker ?—Yes.

Mr, Sharpe?—I do not know that Mr.
Sharpe is a member of the Constitutional So-
ciety.

Mr. Erskine—You will tell us, Mr. At
torncy General, which you know to be mem-
bers of the Constitutional Society, it will save
the time of the Court; I know the fact my-
self, that they do continue to be members.

Mr. Attorney General—When did Ms.
Wharton become a member of your Society?
—I believe, before I had any thing to do
with it. .

I presume you always inquired who the
persons were that you addressed your letters
to, before you wrote an; thing to them !—Yes.

Is lord Daer a member of your society?—
Yes, he is.

I understood you to say, there was an ai-
swer to your letter of the 24th of May, from
Sheffield? —Yes ; there was.
¥ Was that from the same Mr. Ashton?

es.

In as moderate terms as the letter you bad
answered ?—Yes, approving entirely of that
answer which has been read. ;

Do you remember whether that letter, in
those moderate terms, was dated before or
after the 26th of ag hice must have beea
dated after, because the answer was on
24th of May, and this is the reply to that
answer.

It might have been written by the retura
of the post ?—That would not do.

Mr. Daniel Stuart re-examined b
Erskine. .

The reply to your answer was in the same

moderate terms, which must have been later
than the 26th?—Yes.

You were asked, by the attorn ogre,
whether lord Selkirk’s eldest ur, le Daer,
was and is a member of the society of the
Friends of the People ?—He certainly is.

Did not every body know that lord Daer
had been in the British Convention, at Edin-
burgh ?—Yes.

Every gentlernss in the Society of the
Friends of the People, knew that lord Daer
was a delegate there?—Yes; I believe they
all knew; it was in the public papers.

Does he remain still a member of the
Friends of the People ?—He does.

Was there any motion made to expel him,
or question his conduct on that account ?—
None at all.

Mr. Attorney General.—Did your society
know what had been the proceedings of the
British Convention; I do not speak of the
Scotch Convention, but the British Conven-
tion ?—They knew from the public papers, I
believe ; nothing farther.

I observe you say, the answer must be
dated later than the 26th?—Yes.

Why?—it is a reply to an answer signed
by Mr Grey; the letter was dated the 24th
of May; it will take two days to gu to Shef-
field, and two days to bring up a reply.

If your Ictter went from London on the
24th, and was answered by the return of post,
the date of the answer must be the 26th?

Mr. Erskine—Did you ever know a man

; change from a constitutional man, to a repub-

lican, in one post?

Mr. Attorney General.—-Did you ever know
a man who was both a republican and a con-
stitutional man, in one post ?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre —The observations

, upon this transaction are in a much larger and

' Sheffield.

* societ;

higher scale than this.

William Dewsnap, sworn.—-Examined by Mr.
Erskine.

What is your trade?—A razor maker, at
How long were you a member of the so-

ciety?——Nearly from first forming of the

to the last.

Did you attend regularly, in general ?--I did.

What was your object in ming first,

, and afterwards continuing to be a member of

that society ?---The object that I had in view,
was a reformation in the Commons House of
Parliament.

By what means did you seek to obtain that
reform, by the associations that were taking
place at that time ?—By petitioning the House
of Parliament.

Why did you expect that petitioning, by
having associations, and delegations from
those associations, would be more successful
than the ordinary way of petitioning ?—We
adopted the’ plan of the duke of Richmond;
that was the idea that I formed of the business.

From what you heard pass, and from the


general proceedings of the society, had you
any reason to believe, or have you now, while

I am examining you, any reason to believe ~
that the object of the society, in general, was
different from your own?—-I have not; from
the knowledge I have of the society, I believe
that they had only one end in view.

Which was the same end you had?---Yes.

You recollect, no doubt, the obligation
under which you speak—that you are sworn
to speak the truth?—Yes.

Then recollecting the sanction and solem-
nity under which you speak, do you declare it
solemnly to be your helief now, ‘that that was
the general object of your society ?—Yes,

If you had had any reason to believe that
they intended to subvert the government—
for as to touching the life of the king it is in-
decent to state it—if you had any reason to
believe that they had the least idea to subvert
the king’s authority, would you have belonged
to the society ?—No.

If, having belonged to it, you had afterwards
discovered that thet was the object of the
society, would you have continued in it?—
No; I should lave immediately withdrawn
from it.

If you had discovered—I am not talking of
your own internal ideas, which indeed you
have already communicated to us—but if you
had discovered, from the conduct of the
society, not what any one intemperate man
might say or do, but if you had discovered,
from the general conduct of that society, that
its intention was mischievous, and that it
meant to accomplish its purposes by force,
would you have continued in it?—No; I
would immediately have withdrawn as soon
as I had formed an idea that they were mean-
ing 10 obtain it by force.

ere you a member of the society when it
sent a delegate to the Convention in Scotland?
—Yes.

What did you understand your delegate
was to do, representing your society in the
Convention in Scotland; I mean what you
understood, from what was said in your
society at the time ?—That they were to asso-
ciate together, in order to inform the minds of
the people, and to draw up such papers, to be
presented to government, as they thought
would be most conducive to bringing about a
reformation in the Commons House of Par-
liament.

When this Mr. Campbell Brown was sent

to Edinburgh, was he authorized to proceed
in any way, towards any object, but the same
constitutional objects which the society itself
had in view?—No ; he had no other autho-
rity, but acting upon the same principle that
the society had always done,
. Do you remember at what time there was
any alarm spread in your society upon the
subject ?—I recollect, but I cannot justly men-
tion when.

Do you remember a hand-bill?—I have no
knowledge of the hand-bill.

t

Do you remember any insults on offered
to the society, or to any of its members ?—I
have seen people repeatedly assembled toge-
ther, and have heard them speak repeattlly
of assaulting the society; and, from inflam-
matory letters that were published in the Shef-
field paper, by one George Russell, it very
much alarmed the people of the society at
Sheffield.

Upon that occasion did you hear any thing
said about the society having any pikes, or
any thing for its defence ?—No; I am almost
a stranger to the pike business; I have heard
it mentioned, but know little of it.

If the design of the society had been, in
general, to provide arms to carry on its ob-
jects, must you not have heard of it ?—Cer-
tainly.

Were you ever in the committee ?—Yes.

Was it ever proposed by the committee to
the society, or from the society to the com-
mittee, or ever mentioned in the society, that
you were to have arms for your defence,
against the government, or for an attack upon
it?—No; it is a question that was never
agitated in the committee, nor in the society.

Then, until these people were taken up,
aud this unfortunate business, which detains
us here, originated—I ask you, as an honest
man, whether you ever heard of such thing
in your life, as arming, either to resist go-
vernment, or to attack it?—No; I never
beard of it, either before, or since.

id you any views, in the object of your
association, which extended beyond the Com-
mons House of Parliament?—No, we had
not; I had not for my own part, and I reason-
ably hope that the society had not.

- Isthat reasonable hope founded upon what

you observed of their proceedings ?—Yes; I |

never saw any thing to the contrary.

You say the duke of Richmond’s plan was
the object?—The nly object that I had in
view, and the only object I ever understood
that the society at large had in view.

Was the object which the society at large
had in view, the duke of Richmond’s plan,
stated from time to time in the soeiety ?— Yes,

ently stated, and a number of the duke |

ra
of. Richmond's letters to colonel Sharman
were published by the society.

The society, in order to show that that was
their object, published that letter to colonel
Sharman? What was the reason of your so-
ciety for circulating this letter ?—It was for

sole purpose of informing the society at
large of the principles upon which they in-
tended to go.

From every thing then that you know of
the poate of your owa Enowlecee, from
your regular attendance uport it, did they
gl to you to adhere to that object?—

‘Have you continued a member of the »-
ciety up to the present time?—Yes, from
between two and three years ago, down tot»
present period.

Were yu at the meeting at the Castle-hill
in April last?—I was.

Was not the purpose of petitioning the pa-
liament expressly negatived at that meeting?
—It was.

Do not you know that by contrivance, tbat
proposition was brought forward for the pu-

se of receiving a negative?—I was not moch
acquainted with that, neither was I ina situ
tion to hear what passed at the Castle-hil,
there was so large a concourse of people that
I could not get near to the place.

You heard the question put?—No, I cansct
say that I did hear it put; I was at a great
distance, and there was a large concourse of
people.

Did you read the proceedings afterwards ia
Gale's paper ?—Yes—I might see it, but I r-
collect very little of it.

Whatever question was then put, was it
negatived, or carried in the affirmative?—I
belicve it was negatived.

Were there any voices that you heard in the
affirmative ?—I do not know that there was.

Did you know the question that was about
to be put ?—No, I did not.

Knowing that that question had: been nege
tived, and that it had been your object

liament, did you afterwards withdraw yourseli
from a society which had disavowed that ob-
ject?—No, I did not; I remained. .

Do you know of a single member havirz
afterwards, in consequence of that vote, which
you said you read in Gale’s paper, withdrawn
himself from that society?—No, I do not; |
do not recollect a single individual.

Do you know whether the proceedings of
the British Convention were not approved by
your society ?—That is a matter that I am a
stranger to, whether they approved or dissp-

‘oved.

Pires not there a vote of approbation in
society of the proceedings of that convention’
—I have some recollection of it, but I was not
there present, neither can I give any distint
account of that. .

Did' you, before the meeting, know either
from Broomhead or Camage, or any body
else, that the question for another applicatioa
to parliament, which was put on the Castle
billin April, 1794, was meant to be put for
the purpose of being negatived !—No, I dd
not, and I havé had’ correspondence with
Broomhead these: fifteen years; I have
within a hundred yards of him for twelve

Then‘do you believe, or not, that it was or
not put for the purpose of being negetived!—

you had any reason to believe that this plan

Did you ever hear in the society, in the
course of your being there, any determination
of carrying this by force of arms, not merely
by your society, ina body, but your society and
others joining?---Never.

When was it that you heard of arming in
Sheffield; if you ever did hear of arming?

Nor pike ?—No. .

Upon your oath, you had neither a musket
nor a pike?—No.

. Netwithstanding all this dread and excita-
tion in the streets, you still continued to kee
yourself unarmed ?—I kept myself as muci
as possible in my own house.

Which of the magistrates was it you ap-
plied to, for you forgot to mention his name,
to prevent these desperate people from de-
stroying you all?—-We applicd to po magis-
wate

I beg pardon, I made a mistake, it was the
secretary of state you applied tof—No, asa
society we never applied.

I thought we did not understand one ano-
ther; which of the magistrates was it that, as
an individual, you applied to?—None.

You applicd to the secretary of state per-
haps?—No.

Did any body apply ?—No.

Did you not communicate these alarming
threats toany body ?—They were daily in the

rs.

‘ou made no application to any body ?—In
the paper—in the register it was put, that we
advised people to arm to assist the magistrates.

You are an accurate man; I see you take
the duke of Richmond’s and Mr. Pitt’s plan,
and all these things, most perfectly; there
were papers thrown about the streets, desir-
ing the opposite party, opposite to the demo-
crats, to destroy all people of a different per-
suasion ?—Yes, it was in the Courant.

That was the same paper that desired peo-
ple to arm against foreign invasion and do-
mestic enemies?—I do not know what that
was. .

Did pee ever see any paper distributed in
Sheffield by the opposite party, except that
paper that I describe, as an invitation to arm
against domestic enemies and foreign inva-
sion ?—It was that I named in the Courant.

Upon which your society immediately
adopted. their words, and advised the demo-
crats to arm, for the protection of property?

Mr. Erskine.—Is that a proper question?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—It is no ques-
tion ;. it is an assertion.

Mr. Garrow.—Did not your society adopt
the very words of it, as an invitation for the
people to arm, for the protection of property?
—As far as they advised people to arm, it
was according to the rules of the constitution.

Did they not adopt the very language of that
paper, which you stated to be an excitement?
—Words similar to it; we had some appre-
hensions from it.

And did you not, in consequence of that
apprehension, adopt the very words ?—Similar
ones to it.

The duke of Richmond’s plan, and Mr.
Pitt’s, were the things you adopted ?—Yes.

Have the goodness to inform a very igno-
rant man, which I profess myself to be, about
all these things; what was this plan of the
duke of Richmond's and Mr. Pitt’s?—I un-



derstood equal representation in parliament,
and that without it the people would not, asI
understood the matter, have their rights.

What did you take Mr. Pitt’s plan for a

more equal representation to be ?—For every
man to have his voice.

That you took to be Mr. Pitt’s plan?—

Yes.

So much for the accuracy of your informa.

tion, That gentleman read to you something
about rights of man from the duke of Rich-
mond’s plan; those were the only doctrines,
of the rights of man, that ever you troubled
yourselves with at Sheffield, were they; the
duke has introduced an expression about the
rights of man; did you read any other pub-
lications about the rights of man at Sheftield?
—Sometimes.

You were a cutler ?—Yes.
Then of course, you had a cheap copy of

Tom Paine’s Rights of Man, had not you?—
I have read Paine.

That is not an answer; you know every

cutler in Sheffield had one; you had a cheap
copy, had you?—I have seen one of the
others,

I dare say you have seen the best edition ;

have you one of the cheap copies?—I have
seen both.

I am sorry to be so troublesome, but I

must have an answer?—I appeal to the Court, -
whether I am to answer that.

I do not ask you whether you read it to

any human creature but yourself; do you
happen to have one ?—Yes; I have read one.

A cheap copy; was it made a present of to

you, or how did you get it?—I obtained it by
a subscription.

A subscription of the society?—No; my
own, and a few friends.

Upon your oath, to the amount of how
many thousand of your townsmen were
there, that had this cheap edition of the
Rights of Man P—I cannot tell that.

0 you not believe that of the cutlers
alone, in the town of Shefficld, who had the
cheap edition of the Rights of Man, there
were many thousand ?—There were many.

I take for granted, that you having read that
book, considered it very much as a sensible,
well-written book ?—Yes; I thought well of
it.

Were you, or not, one of those who at-
tended and passed resolutions, very properly
approving of that book ?—Sometimes I was
there, sometimes not.

You mean, at the society, where it was
read for information and instruction?—It
seldom, or never, was read publicly at the
society ; Ido not know that ever it was read
in the society.

Was it in the division meeting ?—It was,
when we met privately at our own houses; a
few friends.

When a few friends met for constitutional
information, you then read that book ?—Any
thing.
3X

There werc ether cheap books furnished by
the same subscription, were there not?—Not
many; there were a few. .

Could you help us to the titles of any of
them?—No.

"Do you recollect the proceedings at the
Globe-tavern, in this town?—No.

At Chalk Farm ?—No.

At the Crown and Anchor?—I recollect
seeing their names, never more than what
was published in the public papers.

I hope you had all Paine’s works ?—No.

‘Were you present at the meeting, when a
public resolution was passed, expressing ap-

robation of Paine’s works?—I do not recol-
fect that I was at that meeting.

You will not venture to swear you were
not ?—I was not, I believe.

If you had been there, you would not have
been dissentient?—I cannot tell that.

You told me, just now, you agreed in think-
ang a valuable work ?—I did.

‘hat do you take to be his notion, as to
the use of monarchy in any state ?—I never


took that into consideration properly.

Upon your oath, do you not understand his
book, the Rights of Man, to be a specific for
getting rid of kings every where, not only as
useless, but as burthensome and destructive
to the rights of man ?—If he does, that is not
my mind.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—You are not ask-
ed what you thought yourself, but whether
Mr. Paine’s book did not propose it in that
manner ?—I believe it did, so far as I have
read; hut I never took notice of that pas-
sage ; so far as I approve of it, I agrecd ; but
I did not take it that Mr. Paine meant to des-
troy the king of this country.

Mr. Garrow.—Upon your oath, did you not
understand Paine’s works to be expressly
written for the purpose of inculcating a notion,
that monarchy was destructive to all civilized
states, and that they could not too soon get
rid of all kings?—Though it was published
that we had gained some knowledge by his
works, that was never the intention of the
society, nor did they take that part of his
works,

_ You did not understand it an approbation of
his works?—Only so far as concerned the
House of Commons.

Then I take for granted, you entered a pro-
test against that part that touched the monar-
chy ?—No.

I will read you a little of it: “ All heredi-
tary government is in its nature tyranny.”
Do you happen to know that the monarchy
in this country constituted a part of an here-
aes government?—Yes, I understand it

oes.

- And that Paine asserts tyranny to be in-
terwoven in its very nature and existence ?—
Yes, I suppose he does.

“An heritable crown”— you are politician
enough—I am sure a much better one than I
am—to know that the crown of Great Britain
is an heritable crown ?—I believe it is,

[1044

I take it for granted, that the throne ef
Great Britain is, in your judgment, an herit-
able throne ?—I suppose it is.

Did you know that Paine says this: *¢ An
heritable crown, or an heritable throne, or by
what other fanciful name such things may bs
called, have no other significant explanation,
than that mankind are heritable property.
To inherit a government is to inherit the peo-
ple, as if they were flocks and herds.” This
Passage was not expunged, I hope, in your
cheap edition ?—Our society never took that
into consideration,

Was that passage fairly printed im your
copy ?—I cannot say.

Now, after the account you have given of
yourself, and your manner of studying politics,
Task you upon your oath, do you believe,
that that passage was not in your copy?—I
cannot say.

Then you have no memory of what he says
about heritable crowns and heritable thrones?
—Not of that passage; we never took that
into consideration.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—You are pot
asked whether you approved of that, or took
that into your consideration, but whether it
was in the book ?—I cannot say whether it

- was or was not; it might be.

Mr. Garrow.—Was there any thing in
Paine’s book that had for its object, to recon-
cile the people to the necessary expenses of
their establishments and their government ; to
make them contented under the weight of
taxes that, to be sure, we must bear ?—It was
always advised for people to submit.

Tam asking respecting this book, which
you have studied accurately and attentively;
did it strike you that there were any passages
in it, tending to reconcile the people to the
necessary burthens of the state?—I do not
know that there were.

Were there none that struck you to have a
contrary tendency, to excite the people to be
dissatisfied and discontented, and to think
their burthens were unnecessary? —- We
thought it was our duty to apply to parlis-
ment for redress. ;

That is no answer; tell me whether you
recollect this passage, and I am now reading
out of the cheap edition: “ It is inhuman to
talk of a million sterling a year, paid out of
the public taxes of any country, for the support
of any individual, whilst thousands, who are
forced to contribute thereto, are pining with
want, and struggling with misery.” you
recollect such a passage as this?-—I believe I
do.
“ Monarchy would not have continued so
many ages in the world, had it not been for
the abuses it protects. It is the master fraud
which shelters all others.” Do you recollect
this ?---Yes.

You thought this a strong passage in f&
vour of monarchy did you?-—-That was never
agitated. .

You read this passage ?—Yes. ‘

t
 ee ae


And having read it, be so good as to tell
me whether you consider that as a recom-
mendation ofthe continuance of monarchy, or |
its immediate destruction—how do you un-
derstand the passage ?—We understood that
we might obtain some redress; we did not |
wish, In any way, to touch upon the laws of |
this country, by any means.

T have already digelninned the intention to
ask you any such question, because it is not
fitto ask you whether you were a traitor—-
attend to my question—how did you under-
stand the passage I have read to you, that |
“ monarchy would not have existed so many
ages in the world, had it not been for the
abuses it protects’? Did you understand
that to be a recommendation, to the people
of England, to protect and cultivate the mo-
narchical principle, or to destroy it as soon as
they could ?---I can only answer for myself.

‘ow did you understand the author to be
advising when you read that?—I understood
him to be expressing disattection to the king ;
but then they were always put away, those
things, and never adhered to, upon no consi- |
deration whatever, by any of us.

Upon your oath, do not you understand the |
passage, and did not you, when you read it,

understand it to be a recommendation to get

rid of monarchy as svon as you could ?—-We
never intended to do so.

Did not you understand the author so to
advise ?-—-Certainly ; the words are so.

You understood that the object of a parlia-
mentary reform was to be effected by peti-
tioning, as that gentleman put it; if petitions
of people in ditterent towns would not do,
then there were to be petitions from delegates
in aconvention. Did you expect your redress
from parliament itself?—Yes,

Attend, then, to this passage in Mr. Paine's
book, and tell me what you thought of that:
—~* The bill, which the present Mr. Pitt
brought into parliament, some years ago, to
reform parliament, was on the same erroneous
principle. The right of reform is in the na-
tion, in its original character, and the consti-
tutional method would be by a general con-
vention, elected for the purpose,” and so on.
Now, having read this, as his account of a bill
brought into parliamentto reform parliament ;
and having stated that the nation itself, in its
original character, was to do that, do you still
adhere to it, that you expected it to be done
by the House of Commons?—Yes, and we
thought that the proper place to petition.

You stated to that gentleman, that you
grounded yourselves upon the glorivus ad-
vantages we obtained by the Revolution in
1683 ; you, doubtless, have read with atten-

tion Mr. Paine’s account of these advantages?
---I have scen them, but I have not read
them all.

You have, no doubt, read such a thing as

the Bill of Rights ?—Yes.

"Vhere is no cutler in Sheffield, but has read

that, and attended to Paine’s account of it =
We bave attended to the Bill of Rights,


Does he, in giving his account of this, call
that Bill of Rights, a Bill of Wrongs and In-
sults ?—I never heard any body call it so.

Do not you know Paine so treats it in his
Rights of Man?—Yes.

observe you made use of this expression
more than once, in your answers to the learn-
ed gentleman’s questions, that you ever
heard the society, as a body, propose to teuch
the dignity of the House of Lords, nor as «
body, propose to interfere at all with the mo-
narchy?—-No,

Did you know Mr. Yorke?—~Yes, I know
him; I have seen him.

And have heard him, perhaps ?-—~Yes.
ry private, and in public?—[ have heard

im.

Did he use to attend at the mecting at
Broomhead’s where the tribune was ?---Some-
times.

Were you a member of the secret commit-
tee ?—No.

Did you attend upon the Castle-bill when
Yorke was there ?--I was there some of the
times.

Am [right in supposing there was a mo-
tion made there for petitioning parliament ?—-
There was.

What was the fate of that motion ?---It
was altered to petitioning the king.

The motion for petitioning parliament was
rejected, I believe ?---Yes, it was.

How many votes were there for pctitioning
parliament ?-~I do not know.

Upon your oath, was there a single hand
but the hand of the mover and the seconder;
I suppose all motions were seconded ?

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—It was not se-
conded ?---I cannot answer, there was such a
concourse of people.

How were the votes taker?--By holding
up of hands. .

Were you present upon the other hill, at
Sheffield, at the celebration of the fast ?--
Yes.

You were one of the congregation ?---Yes,
I was there,

How many thousands of you might be there
that day ?~-I cannot tell ; may be two thou-
sand.

You were one who joincd in all the cere-
monies of that day ?---I was there as a looker-
on; that was all.

When was it that your orderly and peace-
able society, at Sheftield, first addressed the
National Convention of France, as a national
convention ?--Never, to my knowledge.

You never heard of'such a thing?---I ne-
ver did,

You did not know that Sheffield had sent
any address to France?-—-No; I did not.

Did you see the proceedings at the Castle-
hill, as printed afterwards with Mr. Yorke’s

speech?—-I did; but never read them.

They were pretty generally distributed at
Sheffield ?--They were to be bought at the
shops.

I suppose you were not in the secret, that
the motion to petition parliament was mude
on purpose to be negatived; were you ac-
quainted, before it was made, that there was
to be such a motion made, ia order to n
me it?--No ; I was not concerned in it at
all.

That petition to the king, you speak of,
was for the abolition of the slave trade?—
Yes, accompanied with the other.

aad enumerating a long list of grievances?
~— Yes,

Mr. Erskine.—It was only @ petition from
the people at Sheffield, that was negatived,
was it?-—No.

Mr. Erskine.—I next propose to read this
Jetter from his grace the duke of Richmond to
colonel Sharman; it has been stated by one
or two of the witnesses; but if it is thought
more regular, I will call the duke himself; I
believe his grace is in attendance.

His Grace the Duke of Richmond sworn.—
Examined by Mr. Erskine.

Mr. Erskine——We have troubled your
grace to attend, in order to inform the Court
whether this letter, which it has been proved
in the course of the evidence, the people of
Bhesiield all looked up to, as containing a

an—— :

Mr. Attorney General.—I must object to
this mode ; I shall be obliged to Mr. Erskine
to ask his grace the duke of Richmond his

uestion, without stating, by a preamble, why

e asks it.

‘Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—You propose to
call his grace, to ask him, whether this paper,
now produced, is his letter to colonel Sharman;
what has passed elsewhere with respect to it
is nothing to the duke of Richmond.

Mr. Erskine.—Please to look at this pam-
phlet?—It is extremely difficult for me to say,
whether the printed paper, that is this mo-
ment given to me, is precisely the letter I did
write tu colonel Sharman, or not, because I
know that there was a printed edition of that
letter which was mutilated ; therefore, whe-
ther this is an exact copy, or not, I cannot
pretend to say.

Does your grace think, that by casting your
eye over it, with attention, you should be able
to answer that question ?—I could.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Then his grace
may sit down, and cast his eye over it.

Duke of Richmond.—I think I can make
the matter shorter, by putting into Mr.
Erskine’s hand a copy of the original edition.

Mr. Aftorney General.—-The better, and
the more regular way will be, that the letter
shown to the Sheffield witness, and which, he
says, contained the plan that they looked to
should be read, and then it should be examined
by somebody with that now produced by the
duke of Richmond.

Lord Chiet Justice Eyre.-—But whether it
be exactly a true copy of the duke’s letter or

no, it is that which they state they- acted |

upon.

deserves the attention of the public, as J con
ceive it would include every other advanteg?
 mom


which a nation can wish; and I have nd he-
sitation in saying that from every considera-
tion which i have been able to give to this
great question, that for many years has ocew-
pied my mind, and from every day’s experi-
ence to the present hour, 1 am more and
more convinced that the restoring the right of
voting universally to every man, not incapacitated
by nature gor want of reasen, or by law for the

1 Commission of crimes, together with annual edec-

tions, is the only reform that can be effectual
and permanent. 1am farther convinced that

: itis the only reform that is practicable.

“ All other plans that are of a palliative na-

' ture have been found insufficient to interest

and animate the great body of the people,
from whose earsestness alone any reform can

; beexpected. A long exclusion from any share
; in the legislature of their country, has ren-
. dered the great massof the people indifferent

whether the monopoly that subsists, continues
in the hands of'a more or dess extended com-
pany ; or whether it is divided by them into
shares of somewhat more or less just propor-
tins. The public feels itself: unconcerned
in these contests, except as to the oppressions

_ it knows must continue so jong as the people

 presentatives.

remain deprived of ali control over their re-
This indifference of theirs,
when the last attempt was made for additional
county members, was used by our opponents
as an argument against all reform ; it was
asked with a triumphant air, where are the
itionsfrom the inhabitants of Birmingham,
lanchester, Halifax, and other great unre-
presented towns? And their silence was
deemed a proof of their acquiescence and sa-
tisfaction in the present form of elections! The j
truth is, that the people have been so often
deceived, that they will now scarcely trust any
setof men; and nothing but self evident con- |
viction, that a measure tends effectually to the
Tecovery of their rights, can, or indeed ought,
to interest them in its favour.

“The lesser reform has been attempted
with every possible advantage in its favour ;
not only trom the zealous support of the ad-
vocates for a more effectual one, but from the
assistance of men of great weight, both inand
out of power. But with all these tempera-
ments and helps, it has failed. Not one pro-
selyte has been gained from corruption, nor
has the least ray of hope been held out from
any quarter, that the House of Commons was
inclined to adopt any other mode of reform.
The weight of corruption has crushed this
more gentle, as it would have defeated any
More efficacious plan in the same circum-
stances. From that quarter, therefore, I have
nothing to hope. It1s From THE PEOPLE AT

viction, but frem the admissiod of the friends
to the more mederate plan, whe, in the se.
cond addressef the Yorkshire committee to
the people, confess that our claims are founded
em the true principles of the constitution,
and only object to them on account of imprac-
ticability. But their plan has now hada fair
trial, and (if it is from the inclination of par-
liament that practicability is to be expected)
bas been found as impracticable as ours, The
more extensive plan, at the same time that
its operation is more complete, depends on a
more effectual support, that of the pore

“Tam also persuaded, that if the scheme
for additional county members had proceeded
eny farther, infinite difficulties would have
arisen in adjusting it. Neitherthe Yorkshire
committee nor Mr. Pitt have given the detail
of their plan. A just repartition would have
been a most intricate task, for where different
interests are separately represented, the pro-
portion is not very easy to ascertain. The
doubt you state concerning this mode of re-
form appears to me well founded ; a few great
families might divide a county between them,
and choose the members by a house list, like
East India directors. Another difficulty from
the increase of the number of members, which
might render the house more tumultuous than
deliberate, has its weight. But the greatest
objectien, in my opinion, to this and to every
other narrow and contracted plan of reform
is, that it proceeds upon the same bad princi-
pleas the abuse it pretends to rectily; it is
still partial and unequal; a vast majority of
feft unrepresented ;
and its most essential concerns, life, liberty,
and pa erty, continue in the absolute dis-
posal of those whom they do not choose, and

j over whom they have no control. In the

arrangements of plans of this kind there is no
leading principle to determine that the addi-

‘ tion ought to be, one hundred, fifty, or two
hundred; that the allotment should be ac-
. cording to the population, property, or taxes
' paid in each county; that any supposed pro-

portion between the landed and trading inter-

| est is the just one, and that the division of

county and city members will correspond with
this proportion when found. All is at sea
without any compass to enable us to distin-
guish the safe from the dangerous course.

“ But in the more liberal and great plan of
universal representation, a clear and distinct
principle at once appears that cannot lead us
wrong. Not conveniency, but right; if it is
not a maxim of our constitution, that a British
subject is to be governed only by laws to
which he has consented by himself or his re-
presentative, we should instantly abandon the
error; but if it is the essential of freedom,
founded on the eternal principles of justice
and wisdom, and our unalienable birth-right,
we should not hesitate in asserting it. Let us
then but determine to act on this broad prin-
ciple, of giving to every man his own, and we
shall immediately get rid of all the perplexi-

ties to which the narrow notions of partiality
and exclusion must ever be subject.

“In the digesting a plan upon this noble
foundation we shall not find any difficulty that
the most common understanding and pains
will not easily surmount. Itdoes not require
half the ingenuity of a common tax bill; and
as a proof of this assertion I myself drew the
form of a bill for this purpose, which I pre-
sented to the House of Lords in 1780; not as
a perfect work, but merely to show how easily
the objections to the practicability of the plan,
and the inconveniences that are suggested,
might be got over. ‘

“T believe the sending you acopy of my
bill will be the best way of explaining its ope-
rations. I have not one ready at this mo-
ment, but it shall soon follow this letter.

“T shall therefore only mention at present
a few of its provisions, which I think entirely
remove the most plausible objections that
have been urged against it.

“The present number of members in the
House of Commons js preserved, so that all
apprehension from too numerous an assembly
ceases,

“ An account of the whole number of males
of age in the kingdom is to be taken and di-
vided by the number of members to be sent,
which will find the quota of electors to choose
one member; from the best accounts I can
now get, it will be about two thousand sir hun-
dred ; these are to be formed into districts or
boroughs from the most contiguous parishes ;
and by having all the elections throughout the
kingdom in onc and the same day, and taken
in cach parish, all fear of riot and tumult
vanishes.

“The great expense of elections, which
arises chiefly from the cost of conveying
‘electors to the place of poll, and entertaining
them there and on the road, will be no more,
when every man will vote in his own parish,
Bribery must entirely cease; in a single bo-
rough it would be difficult, on so many as to
have any effect, impossible. The numbers to
he bought would be infinitely too great for
any purse. Besides, annual parliaments, by
their frequency, and by their shortness, would
doubly operate in preventing corruption.

“ The vast expense of petitions to parlia-
ment on account of the illegal returns, would
be reduced almost to nothing. The points on
which these contests penerally turn, are the
qualifications of the electors under the num-
berless restrictions the present laws have im-
posed, which require the attendance of wit-
nesses, the production of records, and are
subject to infinite dispute. But when no
other, svalitearied should be pace y but
that of being a British subject, and of age,
there can be but little left to contend upon as
to the right of electors to vote. All other
questions that could afford ground for a peti-
tion would be trifling, and might be decided
in one day. Many other objections are ob-
viated by the bill, but it is needless here to
mention them,

against which no provision can be male, wt

Property will have its weight, as it ever mis

2

who, in his consumption of food, and use of

raiment, does not pay taxes, and that I would

wish to encourage an enthusiasm for his
country in the breast of every subject, by giv-

ing him his just share in its government. I

, Yeadily admit, that such an alteration would

' bea vast improvement; but I must prefer the

‘ adhering rigidly to a self-evident principle,

" especially when attended with no inconveni-

‘ence in the execution, that I can foresee.

? Besides, we should again fall into the difticul-

' ties of drawing the line of separation and into

' the disputes about qualification,

' The apprehensions that our government
will become too democratic, have been urged
on another ground. It has been said, that the

‘ House of Commons has usurped the whole

‘ power of government; that the crown in

= reality no longer possesses its negative, and

5 must in all things be ruled by the House of

' Commons: that the House of Lords, in con-

* sequence of its exclusion (by the will of the

House of Commons, and not by law) from in-

t terfering in money bills, no longer, in fact,

‘ exercises the functions of a branch of the

» legislature: that the only means by which the

: balance of the constitution is now in any

. degree preserved, is by the irregular influence

: of the Crown and of the Peers in the House

: of Commons: and that if they are totally ex-

: cluded from interference there, as it is sup-
posed will be the case if this bill passes, and
are not restored to their original share of

. power, the equilibrium will be destroyed, and
the government become purely democratic.

“Yo remedy this objection, it has been
answered by others, that it is but just and
reasonable, and that they mean at the same
time that the Commons are restored to their
rights, that the Crown and the Peers should
recover theirs, This answer has been ridi-
culed in my opinion with more wit, than soli-
dity of argument. It has been represented as
admitting that whilst the House of Commons
continue corrupt, the King and Lords should
submit to its decisions; but that when it
should really speak the voice of the people,
then it would be right to revive the dormant
powers of resisting it.

‘¢ For my part l agree in opinion with those
who are for restoring to all parts of the state
their just rights; at the same time, to do it
generally, not partially, is what I must contend
for. At the same time, I admit that Iam
not for restoring the negative of the crown.
My reason is, that it appears to me preposterous
that the will of one man should for ever obstruct
every regu lation which all the rest of the nation
may think necessary. 1 object to it, as I would
to any other prerogative of the crown, or
privilege of the lords or people, that is nor
FOUNDED ON REASON,

« But I agree, that if the House of Com-
mons was reduced to its natural dependence
an the people alone, and the present system
of making 1t the exclusive part of government
wag continued, we should approach to a pure

democracy more than our constitution war-
rants, or than I wish to see. Iam not fora
democratic, any more than for an aristocratic,
or monarchic government, solely; I am for
that admirable mixture of the three, that our
inimitable and comprehensive constitution
has established: I wish to see the executive
part of government revert to where the con-
stitution has originally placed it, in the hands
of the crown, to be carried on by its ministers :
those ministers under the control of parlia-
ment, and parliament under the control of
the people. I would not have parliament
made, as it daily is, a party concerned in every
act of state, whereby it becomes the executive,
for which it is not calculated, and loses its su-
perintending and controlling power, which is
the main end of its institution. For when
the two Houses are previously pledged by ad-
dresses, votes, and resolutions, it becomes
extremely difficult for them afterwards to
censure measures in which they have been
so deeply engaged by acts of their own,
Another great inconvenience arises from par-
liament’s taking so much of the executive of
overnment on itself, which is, the excessive
length of the sessions; an evil which of late
has greatly encreased. Now that parliament
is engaged in every detail in order to screen
the minister, it never can finish its business
till the middle of the summer, when the inde-
pendent country gentleman, tired of a lon,
attendance, and hot weather in town, is reti
to his private business in the country, and
that of the public left to be settled in thin
houses by a few dependents of the minister.
A short session of two or three months would
be sufficient to examine the expenditure of
former grants, to make new oncs, to redress
grievances, and pass such general laws as
circumstances might require. The inconve-
niency and expense to a private member of
parliament in attending his duty would then
e trifling; and instead of forty commoners
and three peers to form a quorum to decide
the greatest matters of state, the attendance of
two-thirds of each body, which would give
respect to their proceedings, might and ought
to be required. I am also free to own ay
opinion, that when the House of Lords shall
be effectually prevented from having any in-
fluence in the House of Commons, as I think
it must by this bill, it should at the same
time recover its equal rights in every respect
with the House of Commons as a co-ordinate
branch of the legislature. These sentiments
are I think consonant to the idea so well ex-
pressed in your letter to the volunteer army
of the province of Ulster, ¢ to restore to the
‘crown its original splendor, to nobility its an-
‘cicnt privileges, and to the nation at large its
inherent rights.’ .
“T believe I have now troubled you with
all that is necessary concerning my plan.
My bill will show the detu.l as tar as concerns
the House of Commons and the elcction of
Seotch peers: the regulations for restoring to

the crown its.executive, and to the House of
Lords its deliberative functions sheuld be
added to, and form a part of this bill ; but I
have not as yet had time and leisuve to
prepare them. q
. “Inwhat I have said, I have shown my
opinion concerning the tst, Srd, 4th, 6th and
8th questions you have proposed ta me. There
remain the 2nd 5th and 7th to be considered.

“In respect to the second, which I presume
relates to the admission of Roman Catholics
to vote at elections, I can only say, that the
same principles which go to civil liberty,

* equally lead,to liberty of conscience: I admire
with you the glorious spirit of toleration which
ou say has united the once distracted inha-
Bitants of Ireland into one indissoluble mass :
and I am sure that nothing short of evident
danger to the state can warrant its interference
in religious opinions. But unacquainted as I
am with the state of Ireland, it is impossible
> for me to know the present temper and dispo-
sition of the Roman Catholics there, and
those only who are on the spot can judge
how far exclusions of this sort are necessary,
or ought to extend.

“ With regard to the 5th question, if voting
by ballot is advisable? I am clearly of opinion
that it is not. The idea of a ballot can have
arisen but to avoid the effect of some impro-
per influence; and I conceive it much more
noble, directly to check that influence, than
indirectly to evade it by concealment and
deceit. I am convinced that trivial circum-
stances in things like this tend greatly to
form the national character; and that it is
most consistent with that of # British or Irish
freeman, that all his actions should be open
and avowed, and that he should not be
ashanied of declaring in the face of his country
whom he wishes to intrust with its mterests.
Upon the same idea that ballots may bea
eover for independence, they naust also bea
cloak for bribery, and a school for lying and
deceit.

“ As to the 7th question, whether it would

“Rot be equitable or expedient that boroughs
mow in the poasession of individuals should be
purchased by the nation? I think, that
although mo man can have a strict claim. in
equity to be refunded the loss of what neither
buyer nor seller had a right to barter, yet it
will be wise to porehiase the good will, or at
least to soften-the resistance, of the. present
powerful possessors of boroughs, by a most
ample compensation. The liberties of a
Nation cannot be bought too dear; but the
whole cost of these boroughs would not
amount to the profits of one jobbing contract.

“TI have now: answered all the questions
you have been pleased to propose : but I must’
mention another advantage which ought to’
recommend the measures you are pursuing,
to every friend to the internal peace and quiet’
of the kingdom, which is, that-when-the peo+
ple have obtained a regular, legal, and speedy
way of giving effect to their sentiments, there

can no longer be any spprebensioa of ther
endeavouring to redress themselves by mots
and tumults ; aad even such regular and wei-
conducted. meetings as yours will beom
needless. I mention this circumstance with
the more satisfaction, as it stamps your co
duct with the most unequivocal marks of d»
iaterested patriotism. Power, when once x-
quired, is generally endeavoured to be pre
served by its possessors: but you, after
having taken up yours from necessity, and
employed it usefully, are bow endeavouring,
with unexampled virtue, to render its co
tinuance unnecessary. For great as your se-
vices have een fa so svon tg 3 complete
army, in the advantages you have procured
for your country, ta the good, order you have
preserved, and in the efficacy you have givea
to law, you will dorive still greater credi,n
my opinion, frona your good sense in seeing
that a great military force, totally unca-
nected with the civil government, cannotbes
permanent establishment in a free county,
whose first principle is, never to trust absolute
power in any hands whatever Your preset
endeavours to restore the constitution t its
purity and vigour, evidently tend to make ths
and every extraordinary institution unnéces
sary; for, when the people are fairly aul
equally represented in parliament, whea they
have annual opportunities of changing ther
deputies, and through them of controlling
every abuse of government in a safe, cass,
and legal way, there can be no longer aay
reason for recurting to those ever dangerous,
though sometimes necessary expedients of
armed force, which nothing but a bad govern-
ment can justify. Such a magnanimous
to your proceedings, when, after having re
stored liberty, commerce, and free govern
ment to your country, you shall voluntanly
retire to the noble character of private cil-
zens, peaceably enjoying the blessings yu
have procured, will crown your labours with
everlasting glory, and is worthy the geauux
patriotic spint which animates the Irish volur
teers.

“ Before I conclude, I beg leave to express
a wish that the mutually essential connectioa
between Great-Britain and Ireland may s2
be settled on some liberal and fair footing
That which did subsist was on such narrow
and absurd principles, that no friend of either
kingdom can regret its loss; founded on com
straint and dependence, incompatible with
the condition of freemen, Ireland had an i
disputable right to: dissolve it whenever se
chose so to dd. But suroly, if we do not mest
a total separation, it would be right to agree
upon some new terms by which we aretoconl
nueconnected. [havealways thought it forthe
interest of the two islands to be incorporated
and form one and the same kingdom, wth
the same legislature, meeting sometimes 0
Ireland as well: a8 in'Engl But if there
are difficulties to such an‘ union not to be g¢
over at present, some sort of faderal saie,*

least, between the two kingdoms, seems ne-
cessary to ascertain the many circumstances
that concern their joint interests; and an
union of this sort may now be formed with
much greater propriety than before, asit will
be sanctified by the free consent of indepen-
dent nations.
“ T do conceive that some step of this sort
is absolutely necessary, because the present !
footing of separation, rather than union, is |
too unfair to be able long tu subsist. England,
besides the load of the whole debt contracted
for tle use of both kingdoms, bears all the
burdens of naval defence and foreign negoci-
ations, and by far more than its proportion of ,
the land service in time of war. But what is |
worse, is, that there is no certainty now left,
that we shall have the same enemies, and the
same friends; different interests as they may
appear, may lead one kingdom to think a war
necessary, and the other to remain in peace :

the same king, in his different kingdoms, may
think it wise to follow the advice of his re-
spective parliaments: I: need scarcely add,
that the unavoidable consequences of such a
difference, are a war between the two king-
doms. Unless some settlement takes place
upon these and many other important sub-
jects, I am far from being clear that it will
be for the advantage of liberty in either king-
dom, that its monarch should continue the
sovereign of a neighbouring state, with which
it has no connexion. I am sensible that
there are great difficulties attending the ad-
justment of such an union, and that it re-
quires great wisdom and temper to form it,
especially on the part of Ireland, which must
feel that she ought to give the preponderance
to Great Britain: but [ am sure the business
ought not to be neglected, and that ever:

true friend to both kingdoms ought to give it
his most zealous assistance.

“I beg pardon tor having gone into a sub-
ject not immediately belonging to that, upon
which you have desired my opinion, but I
thought it so connected with it, and at the
same time so important, that I trust you will
excuse my having introduced it. I fear I have
been very long, but it was impossible for me
to compress so much matter into a less com-
pass, and when you wished to have my opi-
Bion, I thought it best to give it fully, or at
least as fully as I could in a letter. If it con-
tains one thought that can be useful, I shall
be happy. Ihave only to assure the com-
mittee of the zeal I feel for the cause the vol-
unteers have undertaken, to the support of
which I shall ever be ready to give every as-
sistance in my power; and that it is with
the highest respect and admiration for their
conduct that I have the honour to be, their

most obedient, and most humble servant,
“ RICHMOND, &c.
ee August 15th, 1783.
«< To Lieut. Col. Saanman.”

Mr. Law.—tI have looked over the copy


the Sheffield witness spoke to, while the
clerk has been reading the letter, and'I find
the only variations in this copy to be the word
nor, instead of not, and a transposition of the
word and, it is are and taking, instead of and
are taking.

Mr. Erskine—Gentlemen, this letter,
which from the importance of the subject, as
well as the dignity and good sense of the au-
thor, I chose to read first, was written in an-
swer to the resolutions that had been passed
in Ireland, when lieutenant colonel Sharman
was in the chair.

This letter was written by your grace, in
consequence of the resolutions that had passed
at the meeting of delegates of forty-five
corps?—It was written in answer to the let-
ter that is printed with it.

,. Mr. Erskine.—Then I have a right to read
It.

Mr. Attorney General.—There can be no

pretences for reading any thing more than has

een read upon the ground of any evidence
that has yet been given; whatever respect
may be due to the opinions of his grace the
duke of Richmond, I have a higher duty be-
longing to me, and certainly I should not
have permitted the letter to have been read
if it had not been produced, according to my
judgment, agreeably to the rules of evidence,
in consequence of a witness at the bar statin
that the pamphlet, in his hand, contain
the scheme of reform, that he, the witness,
procecded'upon:—after he had stated that,
as a fact, he had made the paper part of his
evidence, and I conceive that paper would
then have been evidence, whether his grace
the duke of Richmond had been called to
state that fact which his grace, according to
his character, I presume, would state every
where, indeed which the world knows, that
he was the author of it; but I submit to your
lordships that it is going a great deal farther,
to endeavour to connect a Ictter, written b
colonel Sharman to the duke of Richmond,
with the duke of Richmond’s letter, in order
to make that evidence between the king and
the prisoner; no witness having stated, as
yet, that they had ever seen any letter from
colonel Sharman to the duke of Richmond;
or that they had proceeded upon such paper,
or had directed their minds, or conduct, in
any respect whatever by it.

Mr rskine.—Was not this Ictter, that has
been read, published at the time; and was it
published separately, or as an answer to that
preceding it in this book ?—Published at the
time as it is there.

With that to which it is an answer ?—Yes.

Mr. Attorney General.—Still I object to
colonel Sharman’s letter being received in
evidence.

Mr. Erskine.—I shall not argue it now,
though I am not unprepared to argue it with
my learned friend whenever the time shall
arrive; in the meanwhile your lordship will
give me leave to read an extract from the

3Y

Journals of the proceedings of the-House of
Lords.

ia clerk of the House of Lords produced a
vo

ume of the Journals of the Lords.]

Mr. Erskine.—Is this the Journal of the
Lords House of Parliament of the year 1780?

—It is.

Mr. Erskine to the Duke of Richmond.—
Will your grace have the goodness to cast

pour eye upon this Journal, of the 8th of Fe-

ruary, 1780? There is an entry that the
Lords should be summoned to attend the

House, for considering a motion for appoint-

ing a committee, and afterwards there follows
a protest, signed. by your grace, and a great
number of very illustrious peers of this coun-

try, among the rest I see the name of earl
Camden.—Will your grace have the goodness
to tell me if that is your signature to the pro-
test ?—It is.

Mr. Attorney General,—What is the evi-
dence you propose to adduce?

Mr. Erskine—I will state the nature of

this evidence which I offer 3 I will also state
upon. what principle I conceive it to be evi-
dence, unless the attorney-general shall think
it a more regular way for me to content my-
self with stating the nature of it, leaving to
him, in the first instance, to frame his ob-
jection, and for me to answer it.—This was a
anotion, which came on in the House of Lords,
recorded in the Journals of parliament ; there
were petitions from a great number of asso-
ciated bodies of men in this country, which
associations were callin; emphatically and
loudly upon the House on Commons to attend
to its trust, for the House of Commons is,. it-
self, a delegated body, representing the peo-
ple; calling upon the House of Commons to
attend to its trust in consequence of that
wasteful horrible expenditure which took
place in the American war.

Mr. Bower.—You are stating certain facts
wae do not appear upon the evidence you
Offer. .

Mr. Erskine.—They do expressly.

Mr. Bower.—You state that, in fact, to be
a proceeding in partewoent upon certain pe-
Utions, which I say is not opening the evi-
dence, unless you find it there.

’ Mr. Erskine.—I do state that, and I mean
to read it,

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I take it you
are now going to open a motion in the House
of Lords, which is upon the Journals.

Mr. Erskine. —Just so.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—You may open
the substance of that motion; and if you go
beyond that, then their objection lies, that
you have stated something which is not in
the evidence.

Mr. Erskine.—I.am much interested in
avoiding objections, because I am hardly able
to go through the common examination with-
out that. ‘The noble lords in the protest,
state their reasons for that Protest; and


[1000

without reading this, which I have no rick
to do, till your lortab! s shall be please! b
receive it in evidence, I shall be in order, if!
only state what I take to be the general s-
stance of it; and if I, in stating that, shou:
step beyond what the aper itself should sf
terwards show when admitted, then I am pe-
suaded I shall have given very just offence
the Court. The noble lords, among wha
are his grace the duke of Richmond the wit
ness, lord Camden, and others, whose name
are not material, upon the rejection of ths
motion, protest, beeause they conceive it
be the duty of the House to listen to the wil
of the people ;—this is evidence to prom,
that when these very numerous assoczel
bodies presented their petitions, in cus
quence of having had committees to co-op
rate with one another, that the House cau-
dered that, although it might be natn
enough to reject the petitions of private sa
et when the people were in large 2

Teniies, co-operating with one another, a
order to speak what was the will of avey
consitersiite portion of the people (more
pecially if it should at last come to bet
majority of the public) that it a alg 2
never to be invaded, nor argued away,
the will of the people:

Mr. Attorney General.—I do not ko
what it is Mr. Erskine is now alluding to;
but if he will state to me that it is a proceet-
ing of the House of Lords of this kingdoa,
which he conceives can be of use to a subjed
of this kingdom, standing at that bar, letit
be what it will, if it be a proceeding of be
House of Lords, I will not object to it

Mr. Erskine—I am much obliged to you
I was sure that would come from you; |
sure your lordship, that Mr. Gibbs and I hare
read it, and we do think it is material et
dence.

“¢ Dissentient,—First, because however the
waste of public money, and the profusion of
useless salaries, may’ have been heretofore
overlooked in the days of wealth and pros-
perity, the necessities of the present time can
no longer endure the same system of corrup-
tion and prodigality.

“¢ The scarcity of money, the diminished
value of land, the sinking of rents, with the
decline of trade, are melancholy proofs that
we are almost arrived at the end of taxation ;
and yet the demands are annually increased,
while the hopes of peace are every year put to
a greater distance.

«¢ For let any man consider the immense
debt, increasing beyond the possibility of pay-
ment, with the present accumulation of taxes
upon every article, not only of luxury, but of
cenvenience, and even of necessary use; and
let him carry his thoughts forward to those

* See the Debates in the New Parliamen-


additional duties which must immediately be
imposed, to make good the interest of the ap-
proaching loan, and of that debt which wilt
still remain unfunded, he will find that, at
least one million and an half of interest must
be provided for, besides what may be farther
necessary, to make good the deficiencies of the
late taxes.

“ Under these circumstances, the savings’
of a strict and vigilant econumy in every
branch, and the application of overgrown:
salaries, unmerited pensions, and useless:
places to the public service, are almost the
only resources left in thé exhausted state of
our finances. But besides this strongargument
of necessity that presses upon the present
moment, such and so great are the abuses in
the management and expenditure of the pub-
lic money, as would call. for the strictest in-
quiry and animadversion even in the best of
tumes. The practice of expending immense
sums without consent of parliament under the
fallacious head of contingencies and extraor-
dinaries, the greater part of which might
easily be comprised in an estimate, but because
some unforeseen articles are not capable of
such precision the minister has, under that
colour, found out a method of expending the

ublic money first, ad libitum, and when it

as been so expended, has found means to’
induce parliament to think itself bound in
honour to ratify and make it good, deserves
the highest censure; and no minister who
shall Gare to stake the public credit for mo-
ney that las not been voted, ought to be jus-
tified by a less authority than an act ofindeme
nity. The millions which remain in conse-

uence unexplained and unaccounted for—
the shameful facility of admitting almost
every claim —the improvident bargains made
for the public service—the criminal neglect,
and even contempt of the few checks estab-
lished in the Board of Treasury, besides great
part of the money being shared in its passage
among a tribe of collectors, clerks, agents, jo
bers, or contractors, or paid away by oficial
extortion, or stopt in its course to breed in-
terest for some engrossing individuals are
grievances which the present motion has in
view to remedy.

“ Secondly, but great and important as the
motion is in this view of it, it is still more
important in another, as it tends to‘narrow the
wide-spreading influence of the Crown, that’
has found its way into every corner of the
kingdom. ‘

“It is sufficient to allude to this grievance
without any farther enlargement; but this
argument, though, perhaps, the strongest in
favour of the motion, has been turned into
an objection to it, as if it meant to abridge the’
rights of monarchy, and make the Crown de=
pendent upon the parliament,

- “If the objection means to insinuate, that’

corruption is necessary to government, we:
shall feave that principle to confute itself by
its own apparent iniquity.

“ That this motion is intended to diminish
theconstitutional power of the Crown,we deny;
the constitutional power of the Crown we are
no less sulicitous to preserve than we are to
annihilate its unconstitutional influence. The
prerogative, rightly uuderstood, nat touched,
or intended to be touched by this motion,
will support the Crown in all the splendour
which the King’s personal dignity requires,
and with all the authority and vigour necessary
to give due effect to the executive powers of
government.

© it has been argued, that this is not a pro-
per time fur reformation, when all the atten-
tion of the kingdum should be employed upon
the war, as the great and only object in the
present time of distress; to which we beg

eave to insist, that the present is, for that
very reason, the properest time, because no-
thing is so essential to the conduct and pro-
Secutiun of the war as the frugal manage-
ment of that supply, by which only it can be
carried on with any prospect of success; nor
ought the plan of economy to be any longer
delayed at the risk of a general bankruptcy ;
and, trom the history of this as well as other
countries, times of necessity have been always
times of reform.

“Thirdly, because we conceive that the mode
of a committee, which might be to act with a
committee of the other House, and might, if
necessary, be rendered durable, and vested
with due powers by an act of the whole legis-
lature might bring back the public expendi-
ture to its constitutional principle; might de-
vise proper regulations for opening contracts
to the proposals of every fair bidder, for re-
forming the abuses of office and the enormity
of fees, with a variety of other abuses, parti-
cularly that of large sums of money lying in
the hands of individuals, to the loss of the
state.

“ An objection has been strongly urged on
the ground of an apprehension expressed by
some lords, as if they seriously entertained it,
of its producing a quarrel between the two
houses of parliament, in consequence of which
the public business might be obstructed, by a
claim on the part of the House of Commons
to an exclusive right of considering and
providing for the subjects of this motion.

“ Such aclaim certainly cannot be supported
as a consequence of the claim of that House
to originate money bills. Not a single lord
Bpbeared to entertain an idea that such a
claim would be well founded. In truth, the
objection supposes it to be ill-founded, and
that therefore this House will resist it, and
yet it assumes that the House of Commons
will advance and persist in this ill-founded
claim, We cannot discover any colour for
such a supposition, unless we were to adopt
the insinuations of those who represent the
corrupt influence (which it is our wish to sup-

ress) as already pervading that House.
‘hose who entertain that opinion of one
House of Parliament, will hardly think less dis-


respectfully of the other. To them it willsen
a matter of indifference whether the moto
is defeated by the exertion of that influence
to excite a groundless claim in the one hous,
or by a groundless apprehension of such s
claim in the other. But we, who would be
understood to think with more respect of both,
cannot entertain an apprehension so injurious
to the House of Commons, as that they would,
at this time especially, and on this occasion,
have advanced such a claim.

“ The motion has likewise been objected to
on account of its disqualifying persons po-
sessing employments or pensions, to be of
the proposed committee. We are far from
supposing, that the possession of place «
pension, necessarily corrupts the itegnty
of the possessor. We have seen, and th
public have seen, many illustrious instances
to the contrary; yet we cannot but sup
pose that the public expectation of ad-
vantage from this measure would have beea
less sanguine, if they had seen persoss
possessing offices selected to distinguish how
far their offices were useful, or their salaries
adequate. ‘hey, perhaps, would not thisk
the possessor of a pension, or office, the fittest
judge how far that pension or office had been
merited, or was necessary. We cannot there
fore think the motion justly exceptionable
on this ground; it rather appears to usb
have been drawn with a proper attention to
noble lords in that predicament, exempting
them from a situation which they must necer
sarily wish to decline. .

“We conceive ourselves warranted, in the
mode poposed, by precedent as well as reasoa
and it was stated to the House to have beea
recommended by the most approved constitu-
tional authors, who have written since the
revolution; but having offered to meet any
other proposition which might carry with it
substantial remedy, and no such being offered
notwithstanding the time this proposition has
lain before the House, we cannot help cons-
dering the present negative as going to the
substantial as well as formal part of the mo
tion, and hold ourselves obliged to avail ou-
selves of our right of entering our protest
against the rejection of the above propositiot.

“ Fourthly, we are farther impelled to press
this motion, because the object of it has been
seconded and called for by a considerable ma-
jority of the people, who are associating
this purpose, and seem determined to pursue
it by every legal and constitutional me
that can be devised forits success ; and how-
ever some may affect to be alarmed, asif such
associations tended to disturb the peace, &
encroach upon the delegated power of the
other House, we are persuaded it hasno otber
view, but to collect the sense of the peo
and to inform the whole body of the represe*
tatives what are the sentiments of the ¥
body of their constituents, in which respect
their proceedings have been orderly, pes
able, and constitutional ; and if it be asked

‘ what farther is to be done, if these petitions
are rejected, the best answer is, that the case
.. cannot be supposed ; for although, upon a few
: separate petitions, it may be fairly said, that
the other House ought not to be decided by a
~ part only of their constituents, yetit cannot be
presumed they will act in defiance of the
united wishes of the whole people, or indeed
. of any great and notorious majority. It is
is admitied that they have a power to vote as
they think fit; butit is not possible to con-
ceive that so wise an assembly will ever be
. rash enough to reject such petitions, and by
. thatmeans cause this dangerous question to
be broached and agitated, whether they have
not broke their trust ?

“The voice of the people will certainly be
. complied with. Ministers may, as they seem
. to have done in a recent instance, deprive any
man of what he holds at their pleasure, for
presuming to exercise his undoubted right of
_ thinking for himself, on these or other public

subjects ; but it will not be wise in them to
__ treat these associations with contempt, or call
' them by the invidious name of faction; a
name by which the minority, in both Houses
of Parliament, have been so frequently and so
_ falsely calumniated, because the name, so ap-
plied, will recoil back upon themselves, when
acting eee the general sense of the na-
tion. Nor will they be able to represent
these numbers, so respectable in rank and
property, as they did but too successfully the
discontented Americans, as a mob of indigent
and seditious incendiaries, because the people
to whom this is addressed, are the very people
that are abused, and every man bears withi
himself the testimony of its falsehood.

The ministers, on this particular occasion,
cannot deceive the people.

Mr. Daniel Stuart, called in again,

Mr. Erskine.—I call back this gentleman
only for the purpose of asking him one ques-
tion, which £ could not wit Propriety ask
him before ;—you stated, in your former ex-
amination, your personal acquaintance with
the prisoner at the bar, and your transactions
with him before ; did you ever hear him state
what his plan of reform was ?—Yes, I have;
he always stated it to be the duke of Rich-
i, Ca

*Hinchcliffe, + Shipley.


mond’s plan, universal suffrage and annual
parliaments. ,

Was that said to you publicly, or in the pri-
vacy of confidence ?—It was said publicly;
and he sold me ‘some copies of the duke of
Richmond’s letter.

Mr. Att General.—I really must object
to this sort of examination,

Mr. Erskine.—Then I will now defend this
question ; I am persuaded your lordships will -
not refuse to the unfortunate man at the bar,,
that evidence which has been received for,
every prisoner under similar circumstances,
from the earliest times of our history to the
present moment. I am sorry to consume the,
time of the court, but if I am called upon I
will repeat to your lordships, verbatim, from
the State Trials, various questions upon similar
occasions, put by different fa by con-
sent of all the judges, all the attorney-gene-
rals, and solicitor-generals, and counsel for the
Crown. I only wish to know whether the,
question is objected to or not.

Mr. Attorney General.—Itis. . :

Mr. Erskine.—I will proceed, and I have
much more pleasure in doing it from the
manner in which the attorney-general con-
ducted himself recently, because the moment
that it was stated as a proceeding which, we
thought, might be serviceable to the prisoner,
and consistent with the rules of evidence, he.
instantly acceded to its production—therefore,
independent of satisfying your lordships, if I
cun satisfy my learned friend that we are in
the regular course, I am persuaded he would
be sorry, himself, that this prisoner should be
deprived of the advantage which all others
have enjoyed.

Ibelieve the reason why a matter of this

sort falls into debate, is the very singular ano-
maly of the case before your lordships, and I
am the more inclined to think thatI shall
succeed in the little that I have to offer to you
from what fell from the learned judges of the
court of King’s-bench. (two of whom are now
present) when it was discussed how fara.
paper that had been published in the year
1780, which was supposed to have been writ-
ten by some persons of rank, should have been.
received in evidence by Mr. Justice Wilson,
who tried an individual in the year 1793, fora
libel.—The Court supported the rejection of
it.—The learned judge rejected it upon this
principle :—That the defendant in that case
was charged with an act, which act was the
pula ofa libel; and that, although the
late act of parliament * directs, in fact, that
the trial upon a libel, like the trial upon any
other case, proceeds by the judge’s giving his
opinion to the jury in matter of law, still it
does not require that there should be any evi-
dence upon the subject showing the intention
of the prisoner. .

Mr. Justice Buller.—What prosecution do
you allude to you?


Mr. Erskine-—The case of Daniel Holt *;
and upon this ground, they say, you may re-
but evidence fitch fastens any thing that is
wrong upon you, undoubtedly, but because a

rson has published a libel, supposing it to
Pe one, in the year 1780, that will be no an-
swer to your publishing a libelin the year
1793. It may be matter extremely material
in mitigation of punishment, but, said the
Court, it is not strictly evidence, because it
does not go to negative the gist of the indict-
ment; for nup aang itto have been received
by the judge, he could not have told the jury,
if he thought, in point of Jaw, the publica-
tion wasa libel, that the publication of the
same libel by any other person, however re-
spectable, at any other time, was a shield
against the criminal laws attaching upon the
defendant in that case; and upon that ground
I do know that that most intelligent judge,
whose loss we all in common deplore, decided
it; and, as the court of King’s-bench deter-
mined, rightly decided it.

Unless I deceive myself greatly, and unless
T have lost the faculty of seeing whether Iam
assented to, when laying down any proposi-
tion (which when man speaks to man 1s in
general not very diflicult to see) I rather think

am in possession of the opinion of the court
in the striking difference between the case
Now in agitation, and a case where a man is
charged with a fact, which fact, if it be done,
the criminal intention, which arises from the
commission of the criminal act, carries with it
acertain legal inference, which legal infer-
ence, being once established, it does not be-
come a matter of fact for the prisoner to en-
deavour to rebut.

But leaving out of the question all conside-
ration of that act of parliament, I stand upon
the authority of lord Mansfield, in the case
of the king against Woodfall + the printer, re-
ported in sir James Burrow’s fifth volume:
That wherever the fact does constitute the
crime, but that the fact is either in itself
wholly indifferent, or if it is not indifferent but
criminal ; if it be criminal, short of the charge
that is made upon the party, that there the
intention is not matter of law, but that it is
matter of fact, and that the party has a right
to prove his intention in every way, by which
the intention of a man can be safely, or rea-
sonably collected.—To apply that doctrine in
the case I have mentioned, which I am per-
suaded is familiar to all your lordships, in
which a very elaborate judgment was deli-
vered by lord Mansfield, where his lordship
said, the defendant, Woodfall, was found by
the jury guilty of having published the libel ;
and though the defendant called no witnesses
to rebut the criminal inference; yet, says
lord Mansfield, if it be upon the libel, he may
arrest the judgment upon the record, for the
fact of publication is the crime that is imputed
gE aca a ca re PaO el



(1008

to him; and if, when it comes before the
Court, that publication turnsout to be no libel,
the defendant can have no judgment pr
nounced upon him.

Now, what is the present case ?—The Pr
soner is charged with the overt acts, which I
need not repeat, because we are so well a
quainted with the nature of them; but he is
not charged with the commission of thoe
acts, as substantive acts, but he is charge
with having in his mind the wicked and de
testable purpose of aiming at the destruction
of the king, to put down and bring the kiss
to death, and that in the fulfilment of tut

‘most detestable imagination, he did the spec

fic acts charged upon the record ;—that is
say, that he agreed to assemble a conventia
to be held which was not held—that he ca.
spired to hold it, for the purpose of subse
ting the rule and authority of the cousin,
and not that alone, but that he consented te
hold such convention, which convention, 2
his mind, was to accomplish the purpose of
the subversion of the government, and thathe
did agree to assemble that cunvention for the
purpose of that subversion in fulfilment, nit
that the other is the consequence of it, but
fulfilment of the detestable purpose of com-
passing the king’s death. :

Here then the intention of the mind is tz
question which the jury have to try; and/
think I may appeal to what passed in the
Court on Saturday, that I did not seek to by
down other rules of evidence than those thst
have been most recently stated, and those tht
have been determined in ancient times—
Then, that being the case, let us see whelhet
the declarations of a prisoner, charged with
an evil and wicked intention—declarations 4
the time, or about the time—nay, I wil! 9
farther, since | am put to it generally, I sv!
will prove (which is not this case by-the-bs,
for my case does not require it) that if[, «40
am now speaking to your lordships, ¥%
charged with the detestable purpose of com
passing the king’s death, 1 should be intiti!
to callany man in Court—not to my chr
racter—but I should be intitled to call evey
tan in Court who knows my sentimests,
(which are well known upon these subjecs!
what I have repeatedly declared with regard
to the monarchy of this country, and its uulitt
to the system of our government; but thot
I should establish it clearly in twenty insta
ces, or till your lordships desire me to 0 ™
farther, still it would not be so evident as It's
in this case, that the intention of these pe-
sons, and the object which they had in view
was, to follow the plan of the duke of Rich-
mond. —

The first caseI will cite is the most mode,
but not the least important, the case of k
George Gordon,® and I say it is the most 12°
portant, because there he is not c with
compassing the death of the king, but be



charged with an act, with levying war; but
stillit was necessary in the investigation of
that question, since itis not that open rebelli-
ous war which every man must give the same
name to, which nobody could explain away
by evidence, but it being an ambiguous thing,
a sort of constructive levying of war, the in-
tention of his mind becomes the subject of
consideration. I will read to your lordships
the very words and syllables stated by lord
Mansfield upon that occasion.—The question
he puts to the jury is this :—

“First, whether this multitude did assem-
ble and commit acts of violence, with intent
to terrify and compel the legislature to repeal
the act called sir George Savile’s? if upon
this point your opinion should be in the ne-
gative, that makes an end of the whole, and
the prisoner ought to be acquitted: but if
your opinion should be, that the intent of this
multitude, and the violence they committed,
was to force a repeal, there arises a second
point, whether the prisoner at the bar incited,
encouraged, promoted, or assisted ,in rais-
ing this insurrection, and the terror they
carried with them, with the intent of forcing
a repeal of this law ;—If upon this point your
opinion (speaking to the jury), should be in
the negative, that makes an end of the whole,
aod the prisoner must be acquitted: but if
you think it was the intention of the multi-
tude, and the violence they committed was to
force a repeal, the second question arises whe-
ther the prisoner incited, promoted, or as-
Sisted in raising this insurrection, with the
intent,—not with the incitement to make a
riot, and break my windows, or pull down any
man’s house, which might have been felony
under the riot act, if not dispersed, or might
have been a misdemeanor according to the
hatute of the violence committed.--but whe-
ther, to give it the substance of the cage, it
was done with the intent of forcing a repeal
of this law? upon these points, to which you,
gentlemen, will call your attention, depends
the fate of this trial.”

Then the first is a preliminary one, without
which, says my lord Mansfield, my lord
Gcorge Gordon must be scquitied ; but if you
are of opinion that the multitude did commit
the violence, which no man is disposed much
to forget, whether lord George Gordon _in-
Cited them to it? No—but whether he incited
them with that mind which constituted the
crime?

Now I will read all the questions that he
permitted to be asked upon that trial—The
trial was conducted by men of the most ac-
knowledged learning, one, indeed, whose
learning, acuteness, and knowledge of the
common law of England is almost proverbial,
the late Mr. Wallace: the other gentleman,
Mr. Mansficld, had long practised in the
courts of common law, and they were by no
Means disposed to give up any thing; they
would have been drial ifthey had. There
an opposite duty in every trial; there is a

!


duty in those concerned for the crown, to a
port the proper evidence for the crown; and2
similar duty also upon the counsel for the

risoner, and he is as much criminal who re-
laxes the one as he who relaxes the other,
though when it is in favour of a criminal it
would not strike the mind so much;—but I
think that a crown lawyer has a right to in-
sist upon every fair evidence coming before a
jury, and to exclude every thing which may
improperly operate.

he counsel for lord George Gordon were

the present lord Kenyon, lord chief justice of
the King’s-bench, and myself, who have now
the honour to speak to the Court; and I was
permitted to ask the reverend Erasmus Mid-
dleton* (the first witness, and therefore his
examination fell to me as junior in the cause),
these questions ;—I should tell your
ships, to make it more intelligible, that the
great object was, to see what intention lord
George Gordon had, which could be collected
only from what passed before ;—“ Did you,
at any of these numerous meetings of this
Protestant Association, which you attended
from the time lord George Gordon became
president of that society,” (which was two
years before) “ till the 29th of May; did you
ever hear lord George Gordon, in his public
speeches in that association, make use of apy
expressions, which showed any disloyal, or
unconstitutional intentions in him?”—“ Not
in the least; the very reverse in my opinion.”
—Now compare this with the question I am
going to a a cunning artful man might
stand up in a Protestant Association, and
hold forth great professions when he mcant
the contrary; but no man who reposes confi-
dence in the bosom of a friend, building him-
self upon the honour and honesty of his friend,
when he tells him what his object is, will de-
ceive him.——Good God! if I were to ask
people, did not Mr, Hardy, in the Correspon-

‘ding Society, say that the duke of Richmond’s

plan was his object? he might say it there
for the purpose of its afterwards being given in
evidence that he had poet saw that ; if
that may be asked, how is it possible to op-
pose the other?—The examination goes on,
“ Did all his speeches, delivered as president,
meet with your approbation; and did it ap-
pear to you that his views were the same as
those oft the whole associated body?” —“ Quite
so.”—“ Did you ever hear lord George Gordan
make use of aiW’ exprensige as ifhe meant to
fo

repeal this bill rce of arms?”---“ Not in
the least.” Were the meetings open?” and
so on.

Tord Kenyon then examined the present
earl of Mansfield, at that time viscount Stor-
mont, of every thing said by lord George
Gordon, at St. James's, when he came to ask
an audience of the king, and tendered his ser-


vices to suppress the riots.—-He called after-
‘wards sir Philip Jennings Clerke, lord Lons-
dale, and many other witnesses, to conversa-
- tions with lord George Gordon both before
‘and after, and to every part of his conduct and
‘deportment upon that occasion.---It certainly
was not debated, I think it the stronger for
that, because when a cause of that immense
‘magnitude is tried, where the whole capital
‘was threatened with ruin, and when, as it has
been said by the eloquent person we have
heard of so much in the course of this trial
‘that this town, and the whole country
‘were in the utmost peril, I cannot suppose that
those who represented government, were dis-
‘posed to treat lord George Gordon with more
lenity than the rules of law entitled him to;
‘yet neither Mr. Mansfield, nor Mr. Wallace,
the attorney and solicitor-general, objected to
that evidence ;~-I say nothing of myself, I
was then a very young man in the profession,
but the present chicf justice of England, who
conducted that cause on the part of lord
Gcorge Gordon was, and is, as weall know, a
man of great learning, he put those questions
without the smallest objection falling from
Jord Mansfield,or Mr. Justice Buller who now
hears me, or any other person.

The next case I shall state is that of my
lord Russell, * who was indicted for compass-
ing the king’s death, and the overt act was
consulting to raise rebellion, and to seize the
king’s guards. In his defence he called many
persons of quality to speak to his affection to-
wards the government, and his detestation of
risings against it; I will pauseherea minute,

‘—why a man might have a great deal of af-
fection to the government in the year 1780,
and might change upon the subject, but yet
‘the criminal law of England looks out indus-
triously to see how it can interpose in favour
of liberty and life, not trying how it can shut
‘out the light, but how it can let it shine
in; even that question, which I do not
think one of the strictest, was suffered to be
let in, because Dr. Burnet had had a long ac-
quaintance with lord Russell, and lord Russell
ight not have conceived the purposes of re-
‘bellion till a short time before; but I shall
ask, as to the time when they say this man’s
mind was full of this conspiracy, so horrible
in its nature, what were the sentiments which
he was pouring into the bosom of his friend,
as the object of all these societies,
“ Doctor Burnet,” (says lord Russell) “ if
you please to give some account of my con-
‘versation?” Doctor Burnet says, “ I have had
the honor to be known to my lord Russell se-
veral years, and he hath declared himself with
much confidence to me, and he always, upon
all occasions, ig gga himself against all
risings.” Now this is not character, to say
that lord Russell was a quiet, peaceable man ;
no, this is evidence of conversation, my lord


.



Russell declared so; therefore it is not th
you are to raise a probability upon the sutix:

yy the general nature ofa man’s character, «t
what you think of him; but it shall be ali.
ed to witnesses to say what the person tnin:
has expressed, because it raises an intni
improbability of his being golly of the crize
imputed to him; doctor Burnet says, “x
always expressed himself against all nsinzx:
and when he spoke of some people that wa
provoke to it, he expressed himself so dex-
mined against that matter, I think nom:
could do more.”*—Does his saying this, x
quit lord Russell of this rising; you heardi.2
say he was against all such risings as ares
the subject of inquiry before you?”—* I bar
him speak with indignation upon the subitl.
—From thence the jury might inter ms
quantum valere potest—I do not say it 8
conclude any thing ; I do not say that tht
sort of evidence is at once to put an endt
any cause, no man can be so foolish ab
fancy that, but as far as it goes what is tole
come of it after that evidence is heard, il &
not for me but for your lordship and the fx:
to decide ; the jury ultimately, but we shalt!
be happy to hear your lordship’s obsersstea
uponit; but the question is when it shall k
heard, what impression it will make wy
both.

Doctor Cox was then asked the =
tions by lord Russell, and he says, “I bue
heard him profess, solemnly, he thought it
would ruin the best cause in the world toule
any of these irregular ways for the presents
of it.” +—Your lordships will give me leave
pause again here.—This is not evena decin-
tion of lord Russell, indicative of his gene!
ideas, but upon the very point of trial; tu
he, doctor Cox, had heard the prisoner &
press his indignation and contempt for pre
ceedings like those imputed to him—As!
along, let me bring back to your lost
consideration what it is I want to
have a much more recent authority, the
thority of one of your lordships, sixe
cause began ;—What, shall a man not bed:
lowed to explain his own meaning? If 1"
ness had said, the defendant held a comes
tion for the purpose of overturning iad
vernment, still I should have thought Ibs»
right to examine the evidence, wheres att
expression goes directly in the teeth of ¥
he has written; but where, as your ad
has expressed upon another occasion, ial
upon the surface a thing appears to be ¥
that the crime consists in the veil and corer’:
of a wicked and detestable purpose, that om
matter of fact merely—a matter of ™
serious investigation, that your 1
take it as a matter that no mad, 0
life, between man and man, would throw
his neighbour, but upon the most claw,
satisfactory proof; it is upon this groasl

we have aright to raise up in the minds of |

the Court an intrinsic evidence, to operate as
character does, for how is it that character is
admitted against a fact?—I have heard a
judge say here, if a fact is proved by ten wit-
nesses distinctly, it is not possible to suppose
that ten witnesses are perjured, who swear
that I have stole a horse ; my character might
create compassion with a jury, but could not
do more, because there is much more proba-
bility that a man who has hitherto maintained
a good character should stcal a horse, than
that ten men should combine to destroy
an innocent man when there is no reason to
impute the crime to them; but when it re-
mains matter of doubt, whenever the question
is, What you have done ? and the consequent
question is the quality of the act, and when
your lordships are to fix the quality upon it,
aud to consider, not whether it be the act, but
whether it be the intention—suppose the jury
should find that he had summoned a conven-
tion to do that which I know he did not, yet
they must farther find that he did it in the
language of the record, in the farther fulfil-
ment ot his detestable purpose.

Mr. Luton Gore, and doctor Fitzwilliams
were examined to the same point; ® this trial
was before lord chief justice Pemberton; sir
Robert Sawyer, whose name I have had occa-
sion to mention (who was nota gentleman
fond of making very great concessions, I do
not mean to say he ought, he was a most
rigid man), was attorney-general, the cele-
brated Mr. Finch was solicitor-gencral, and
upon that trial your lordship sees all these
questions are put without any objection.

The next case is that of Thomas Rosewellt
who was a dissenting minister; he was in-
dicted for preaching a treasonable sermon ;
besides giving evidence directly denying
the charge, fe called several of his con-

regation to prove that he generally kept
the 30th of January as a fast, and frequently

reached in favour of kingly government.
Now only consider the difference of these two
cases ; there the preaching the sermon was
proved—lI have looked at the trial, because I
saw this question brewing some days since,
and therefore prepared myself for it---Rose-
well was char with the publication of a
libel in preaching this sermon ;—of a libel,
for we all know that words cannot amount to
high treason, but they may be so indecent as
to be libellous, and may be of a treasonable
nature, according to the subject. Then what
was the evidence against the defendant? It
was that A. B. C. D. heard him say the
words; what is his answer to that? not at all
what mine is, he wanted to raise up before
the court and jury, a probability that the wit-
nesses were either perjured or mistaken, be-
cause of the improbability that a man, who
kept regularly the fast of the 30th of January,



and who preached regularly in favour of the
kingly government, should upon any one
given occasion, such as imputed, have con-
tradicted the general habits of his life, and
Jibelled that government which he was accus-
tomed to support ;~--but that is not my view
in calling Mr. Stuart, for my learned friends
have fixed no such object upon my client ;
he has called a convention they say, and the
say farther that he did it for a purpose, whic!
I deny, and in fulfilment of another purpose,
which I deny.—Am I not from these authori-
ties to be allowed to produce the same sort of
evidence in support of this poor shoe-maker,
which the greatest men of the country have
ever had an opportunity of doing without the
smallest doubt? Mr. Rosewell says, “ Did
you ever hear that I should say any thing ill
ofthe king or government?” Mr. Strong,
“ No never.”* r. Rosewell asks Atkinson,
another witness, ‘ That which I call you now
for, sir, is to testify what you heard upon the
Soth of January from me, about praying for
the king and all that are in authority?” At-
kinson, “ my lord, he kept that day, the 30th
of January, as a day of fasting and prayer, and
| he preached from that text on the 1st Timothy
2,1. “ Pray for kings and all in authority.”
That was not the sermon for which he was
indicted ; but in order to show that it was
not probable he should have preached such a
sermon as he was charged with, he shows
that at a recent time he had preached diffe-
| rently ;—and certainly it is fair evidence; a
| man is not a republican on Monday, a mo
| Marchy man on Tuesday, and a republican
in on Wednesday, his sentiments do not
1 change inamoment. >
Mr. Atkinson proceeds in his evidence and
| says, “ and then he did assert that kingly go-
vernment was most agreeable to the word of
God, and the constitution of the government
of England.”t My lords it is material that
you should know who tried this cause, lord
chief justice Jefferies tried this cause, and it
is stated that he received the evidence; and
Hume, the historian, remarked, such was the
effect that had, that the jury of course com
victed him, as they would every body else;
that the chief justice did not even sum up the
evidence, but contented himself with railing
against conventicles. .
The next is Henry Curnish’s case; in 1
James 2nd, 1685, and when were these cases?
at the very worst times in this country, whem
judges were, what none of your lordships can,
in the nature of things, be, men dependent
upon the crown. Henry Cornish was indict-
ed for compassing the king’s death ;—the
overt act was conspiring with lord Russell
and the duke of Monmouth to levy war ;—he
called several witnesses to testify his loyalty,
and though the witnesses were discouraged,


214, 215. i
iA

they were permitted to swear that they
thought him loyal, and that he often dran!
the King’s health.* Lord chief justice Jones
was the judge who tried the cause, sir Robert
Sawyer was still attorney-general, and Mr.
Finch solicitor-general.

John Ashton was indicted, in 2 William
and Mary, for a conspiracy to dethrone kin
William, and compass his death ; the counse
for the crown, in the opening, charged the
prisoner with an intention to introduce
popery ; in answer to which he gives evidence,
which is to be found in the State Trialst of
his zeal for the Protestant religion, and aver-
sion to Popery.

The crown say, that Mr. Hardy conspired
to call this convention, which was to be as-
sembled of delegates from some societies, of
one of which he was secretary; which con-
vention was to be assembled for the detestable
purpose of subverting the government, de-
posing the king, and procuring his death;
therefere I want to prove what was at that
time the state of this man’s mind; what it
was that he was constantly considering, erro-
neously, or otherwise; and upon this case it
is not necessary for me to justify what the
illustrious person, who is here present, has
published ; whether it was wise, discreet, and
egal in the duke of Richmond to publish
that, I have nothing to do with; and if my
client were charged with publishing that
which is put into the hands of the witness,
after what has been ruled in the King’s-bench

- I should not have offered it, because your
lordships would have said that the publication
of this as a libel, which constitutes that crime,
would not be protected by the duke of Rich-
mond having published the same libel at
another time; or with your intention being
only to publish that which the duke had set
you the example to publish.—But when the

uestion is what the intention of the mind of
the man was? and when you have seen the
duke’s plan,—I do not choose to affront a
noble and honourable person, the pleasure of
whose acquaintance I have long had,—the
duke would have thought, and I should have
thought, I had affronted him, if I had asked,
did you, when you wrote this letter, mean
thereby to depose the king, and to put him to
death? He had no such intention, he could
have none, his own interest is deeply involved
in the safety of the state, he is himself of the
same noble blood with the family now upon
the throne. Then I wish to know if I may
not be allowed, upon the authorities I have
cited, to ask the witness this question?

My lord, in the case I last stated, doctor
Fitzwilliams, one of the witnesses examined
upon this point, says, “ he, (that is the de-
fendant) has always taken occasion, that I
know several times, both at St. James’s and at

Ny, p. 434.

,
f


Edinburgh, to testify his zeal against Popery.”
—The very charge upon the record being
restore king James and bring in Pppery.
The man's mind is proposed to be, and i
consented by judges to be decyphered, oaleat
quantum ‘valere potest, by his uniform declare
tions of his detestation of those principles
whicl the charge supposes him to have en-
tertained. This trial was before that mos
excellent judge lord chief justice Holt, and
was conducted on the part of the crown ty
serjeants Thompson and Tremain.

The next is the case of sir John Freind,*
whose trial you have heard ef in the course of
the cause, who was indicted for compassing
the death of king William, and promoting an

invasion and rebellion within the realm ; and
in his defence he called many witnesses, ot
to his character, for I take it that the meaning
of witnesses to character is this,—for instame,
put the case of a man who is charged wilb 4
crime of any particular description, suppose
man charged with an unnatural crime, would
it be any evidence at all to: that man’s cha-
racter that he paid his bills regularly, ané
that he was not a dishonest man, or a0y
thing of that sort? No, your examination to
character must always be analogous to the
nature of the charge, and you would there in-
quire, whether he was a man of chastity, vou
would inquire into his re; for women, into
his morals, and into his conversation, so as it
might rebuff any such horrible and detestable
idea having passed in his mind, that he wasa
man capable, in the ordinary course of his
life, of efttertaining such opinions, and mak-
ing use of such expressions ;—so if a man is
indicted for any other offence, if a man is i-
dicted for a robbery, I say I will show you that
he was not a necessitous man, that he por
sessed a large fortune at that time, that be
was a man whose ideas were moral and t-
tally contrary to any such practice, that is the
nature of character; but ] am not even ask
ing that, I have been allowed to ask alreadr,
and was not obstructed in it, as to Mr. Hardy's
character for peace and quietness, but I am
not asking that; butin the cases I have cited,
that general character was permitted farther
to be evidenced by that which it always mest
produce, “¢ out of the fulness of the heart the
mouth speaketh ;” it does not always speak
out of the fulness of the heart in public, ia
private it ever does, but whether it does of
not I am not inquiring into.—The jury may
think after I have given the evidenee, thatit
proves nothing, or little better than nothing;
I hope they will not think so, but we are no"
considering whether it shall be heard, nt
what it amounts to when heard.

In sir John Freind’s case, he says to the
witnegs—“ When you have been in my com:
pany, and they have been speaking of the
government, what have I said or done?”+ Is

 a
b>

that any thing like character? Suppose at ! familiar case,

this moment I should turn about to Mr.
Stuart and say, when you have been speaking
of government with Mr. Hardy, what has he
gail or done? If my friend chooses to close
the debate here, I will change my question to
that, when you have been speaking with Mr.
Hardy, upon the subject of the government of
Great Britain, what has he said, or done?
Why, says he, whenever I made use of any
Teflecting words upon the subject, he was used
to say forbear. The prisoner asks “ What
-have you heard me speak of the French, and

about any thing of an invasion? how I would ;

venture my life for the Protestant religion or
any thing of that?”*—A pretty handsome
leading question too, but the minds of men
are soothed and softened as they oughit to be,
when a man, after the whole weight and artil-
lery of the crown’s evidence has come against
him, is standing up in the feebleness of inno-
cence to make his defence.

The attorney general will not, he cannot,
think, after what I have said in the course of
the cause, that I mean to insinuate any thing
disrespectful to him, but only that this priso-
ner may have full measure, and not more
than the full measure ; I think he has just as
little right to have any more, as you have to
refuse him that which he has. Mr. Lupton
ays,“ TI have often heard you say, as to the
Present government, that though you could
Dot comply with it, you would live peaceably
under it; when we have been talking of
these things, you said you never would be ina
plot.” Now try that,—when I have been
conversing with Mr. Hardy, he said he went
upon the duke of Richmond’s plan, but he
ever would be concerned in any plot against

@ government, never do any thing that was
@ conspiracy, but meant to limit his intention
to any exertions to any given thing the wit-
ness will say, and which [ certainly shall not
put into his mouth.

The next case is in 8 William 3rd, Peter
Cvok’s case, who was indicted for the same
treason of which sir John Freind was con-
victed, and the prisoner in his defence goes
exactly to the same kind of evidence adduced
i a the former trial. Mr. Serjeant Darnell,
who was counsel for the prisoner, says,
“ What have you heard the prisoncr say
about our fleet or army?” What has that to
do with his character? it was to negative the
probability of his wishing to bring to destruc-
tion our army and navy, and to bring in a
foreign prince who had been expelled from
this country for not recollecting what rights
Belonged to the people of this country; he
says, “I have heard him very much wish
prosperity and success to our fleet.”+

The next is the case of Dammaree,t that





f which we hear of almost every
day, in illustration of the principle of con-
structive levying war;—he was a badge
waterman to queen Anne; he was tried for
pulling down a meeting house, and which
Mr. Justice Foster says, “ was held to bea
constructive levying of war,” and which was
not put as an overt act of compassing the
king’s death. This is a very particular case,
here is a man taken in the fact of pulling
down a meeting house. Good God! I care
not for his affection—if a man is taken in
pulling down a mecting house, the law says
he is guilty of high treason, for he absolutely
does an act which, in construction of law, is @
levying war against the king. A man may
say I did not intend to levy war: a man
comes with a hundred men, and is caught
paling down my house, and says I did not
intend to hurt you;—here is an ambiguous
thing, a thing which if it be said not to be
ieeak is totally different from the charge in
the indictment; and the office of my learned
friend, who objects to my question, is to turn
it round and to put a different construction ;
to put the worst construction, instead of the
best construction, upon this man's conduct,
and I am seeking to prove that probability,
by the same rules of evidence ever adopted,
not in a case like this, where the intention
constitutes the crime ; where it is voluntus pro
facto, but in cases, even where it is factum
pro toluntate ; I say when men assemble in

teat numbers to pull down all meeting

ouses ;—for though it would be difficult in
the time ‘of Edward 3rd, to say that that ‘was
what our ancestors meant by levying war,
putting that aside, not to get into interlocutory
debates in the middle of an argument, I say
this is a peculiar and anomalous case, that its
parallel is not to be found throughout the
whole circle of the law, and for this wise

reason, that his majesty’s life is so dear, his
majesty’s life is so interwoven with the whole
principle of the state ; his life, as chief magis-
trate, being that which if destroyed might
bring on a convulsion in the country, which
convulsion might deprive us of all that is
dear to us, the law wisely makes the intention
to destroy the king as guilty as the accom-
plishment, but then the intention is not any
thing that you can argue into intention, but
must be deduced from acts, which the jury
must believe to have flowed from his mind

and to have been the effect of that wicked
and detestable purpose ;—why then, surely
when that is the case, I have a right to ask
whether the prisoner meant to pursue the
duke of Richmond's plan? and leaving to your
lordship and the jury to infer what I thought
it would have been an insult to ask, whether, .
in merely following the plan of a person of
illustrious birth, together with a great number
of respectable persons some years ago, he
meant to commit the crime imputed by this
indictment? Surely it gues most strongly to
negative that which constitutes the essence of

this crime.

Upon the examination of John Michaelmas,
Mr. Whitaker, the counsel for Dammaree
asked,“ was he disaffected to the queen and go-
vernment?” he says, “,I believe no man better
affected.” “At any times when there have
been public rejoicings for any victories, how
has he behaved himself?”* Now the first
question is as to character, as aflected or dis-
atfected, collecting it generally; but the second
is to what has he said, how has he behaved at
times of public rejoicings; when you have
conversed with him, how has he declared
himself; that is not a question to character.
The difference between evidence to character,
and this species of evidence, is this—as to
character, what character has this person, and
we have bcen very properly restrained ; Icon-
fess I have been irregular once or twice, and
so has my friend, Mr. Gibbs, and your lord-
ship has toid us of itin a very indulgent man-
ner, for putting questions to character ina
different way from what the practice is, You
cannot, when asking to character, ask what
has A. B.C. told you about this man’s charac-
ter, no, but what is the general opinion con-
cerning him. Character is the slow-spreading
influence of opinion, arising from the deport-
ment of a man in society ; as a man’s deport-
ment, good or bad, necéssarily produces one
circle without another, and so extends itself
till it unites in one gencral opinion; that
general opinion is allowed to be given in evi-
dence. But this case is totally foreign to that,
as it is a declaration of the prisoner to an in-
dividual witness upon a particular occasion,
and connected with the subjectjunder exami-
Dation.

I shall not trouble your lordship with many
more cases, for if these are not sufficient,
none can be.

The next is the case of Francis Francia,
who was indicted for high treason, in corres-
ponding with the pretender. In his defence,
Mr. Hungerford says to a witness, “ what do
you know of the prisoner’s behaviour ?”?—“ It
was a great surprise to me when I heard that
he was taken up, for he used often to drink a
health to king George."

In Fitzharris’s case, he asks a witness
whether he thinks the act with which he is
charged, was done with a treasonable inten-
tion{—that is not objected to, though Jeffe-
ries conducted that cause.

Then supposing these authorities to be out
of the question, and supposing that these
which Thave troubled your lordship with had
not existed, but that I was obliged to do that
which it is my privilege to do, to stand upon

582.




the principles of the criminal law of Enza,
which are full well known to your lordshiy,
without being obliged to look up to othe
sources, Your lordships all of you have long
presided in courts of justice, and I am sm
those of your lordships particularly, vb
preside in criminal courts of justice, having
great expericnce, must think that when te
nature of this case is considered, when its
anomaly is attended to, when it is recollectel
that although the statute of 25 Edward sx,
certainly docs not make the overt-act charged
upon the record treason, yet when the overt
act is admitted to be charged upon the record,
every thing which creates a probability to te
contrary, to negative the intention, mustle
received, provided it be a rational principle a
evidence, provided it be of a sort that wha
one looks round it, one sees nothing by wld
justice may be surprised and endaugered; fa
I should be extremely sorry to press in the
most criminal case, however agitated or ear
est I might be upon the subject, for sy
thing which had not been indulged to others
in a similar course of proceedings. I wish
much as any subject of the country cao wish,
that the law of the land should be admins
tered tairly and impartially ; that one mz
should have what another has had, but
more, and no less; and I conceive that whes
my friend, the attorney-general, takes the
into his consideration, that he will think the
cases I have cited, and the principle on whieh
they are grounded, entitle me to have this
evidence almitied, I would not have troubled
your lordships with the cases, but I considered
it as a matter of importance, not only ssi
concerned the administration of justice 10 ge
neral, but as it concerns the case of the ptr
soner before you. .

Mr. Gibbs.—I submit to your ar og that
this evidence is admissible. My leame
friend has exhausted all the law that an
out of the ‘case, and therefore it will not be
necessary for me to trouble your lordsbups
upon that part of the case ;—but it seems to
me upon a plain principle in a case of
sort, the declaration of the prisoner explaiz-
ing the overt-act, the tendency of which over
act is the point for the jury to determine
toust be admissible evidence. . .

Your lordships will find it is laid down 0
lord Hale—I believe it is laid down io muy
cases, that an overt-act, indifferent is 4
nature, may yet be explained to be an ovett-
act committed, tending to the purpose cor
ceived by the prisoner of destroying the king;
for instance, theact ch upon Crobagal,
the coming into England was in itself a0
different act, which became an overt-act
compassing the king's death, because te
intent of bis coming into England was &
plained by words spoken elsewhere; ands
many other cases I take it that words


" bya man, not only at the time of the overt-
' act, but before that time, are admissible, for
' there is no limitation of time within which
‘ words spoken by a prisoner may not be given
" in evidence to explain the nature of an overt-
" act, charged to be an overt-act in the prosecu-
¥ tion of his design of compassing the king’s
1 death.
1 Now if the crown may give evidence of the
'’ whole of @ man’s life, for the purpose of ex-
} plaining an indifferent act, and giving it a
" criminal complexion, surely it follows, upon
‘ the principle of administering - equal justice,
a that whatever he has said upon the same
. subject, tending to prove a different intention,
i an innocent intention, it should be competent
’ to him to give in evidence. I take the dis-
. tinction to be this—if that which is charged
upon a man be an act, if it be a thing done,
~ you cannot in any case give in evidence that
the prisoner has denied that he did the thing.
= The crown in that case may give evidence,
that the prisoner did at any time admit that

. he committed the act, that he did the thing,

: the prisoner cannot answer that, by showing
that at another time he said he had not done

, it, though you may ask whether he had not

- held some other conversation which explained

; the tendency of that. We have it not in

. question now, whether he did commit the

, overt-act stated in theindictment, but whether

,» In committing the act, he had, or not, the

: original design

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Here the design

"is part of the overt-act; it is described as part

. of the overt-act.

“Mr. Gibbs.—The design is a part of the
overt-act in this way—the overt-act of com-
passing the king’s death, is his consenting to

* the calling together a convention for the pur-
pose of deposing the king; it states first the

‘: treason ; the treason laid is that he compassed
the king’s death, and then the overt-act is
laid thus—that he, with others, for the pur-
pose of accomplishing the treason, did conspire
with others to call this convention, in order
that this convention might depose the king.

The distinction that I was taking is this—
I know that we have before the jury both the
fact and the design as to deposing the king;
namely, the fact of consenting to hold a con-
vention, and the design with which it was
consented to be held; but we are now about
to show what the design was, to exculpate the
prisoner trom any criminal intention. I admit
we could not go into evidence of what the
prisoner had said at any time of his life, for
the purpose of showing he had not consented
to hoid this convention, because that is a fact ;
but [ submit with great deference to your
lordship, that in order to show that that con-
vention was consented to be held, not with
the design which the crown imputes, but with
an mrocent design, we may go into evidence
of what the prisoner has at other times de-
clared, inasmuch as the crown has gone into
ull that which the prisoner at apy part of his


life has declared touching this fact; and not
only that, butinto evidence of what any mem-
ber in the London Corresponding Society, any
member of the Constitutional Society, or an
member of any societies corresponding with
those societies have said. As the crown is
permitted to go into evidence of what any
one of those people have said, in order to
prove that the ultimate design was to depose
the king, we only ask in answer to that, that
we may be permitted to go into declarations
of the prisoner of that which can be only
found in his own mind; not that he did not
do the act imputed to him, but that the design
with which he did that act, was different from
that which the crown imputes.
I was going to put a case which I had
forgot in the course of the argument, which
appears to me not unlike this, and which
was suggested by your lordship’s saying that
the design of deposing the king is a part of
the overt act—the case of murder; suppose
it plainly proved that the prisoner did kill the
deceased, and the question is whether it
is murder or manslaughter, that will turn
upon the intent. I take it in that case it is
the constant, uniform practice to receive evi-
dence ef the declarations of the prisoner of
his -will and friendship to the deceased.
—Now, why are these declarations received ;
Iam sure I have heard, in innumerable in-
stances, evidence given of declarations of pri-
soners of good-will to the deceased, when
they have admitted they gave the fatal blow,
and when the question is, what is the quality
of the act committed, whether murder or
manslaughter ; and the rule, I take it, is not
confined to declarations immediately upon
committing the act, but to declarations at
former times. Why are these declarations
received; the act of giving the blow is ad-
mitted. So here the calling a convention is
admitted, the declarations are received for this
purpose, to show what the mind of the man
was, what his intent must have been, whether
he gave the blow with a view to produce death
or not. Then with what view do we offer
this evidence? to show his design, whether it
was the design the attorney general imputes,
or an innocent one. We offer this evidence
in order to show that the object of this con-
vention was different from that which the at-
torney general states, in the same way as the
evidence of good-will to the deceased is ad-
mitted, in a case where the question is, whe-
ther the crime is murder or manslaughter.
Mr. Attorney General.—I rise in the first
place to state to your lordships the objection
which I have to the question that was ad-
dressed by my learned friend to the witness.
1 hoped that this objection had followed so
immediately upon a conduct that I am per-
suaded betrayed, on my part, no wish to shut
out any evidence that appeared to me to be
admissible, that my learned friend would sin-
cerely have given me credit, as he now states
he does, for making this objection upon a

ublic principle. I beg to say again, what I
; Lies had occasion to say befure in the course
of this trial, that it belongs to every man in
acourt of justice, as it dues to every man
elsewhere, to be liable to error; it 1s not,
therefore, with any confidence that I must be
right, in the objection which I take, that I
presume to trouble your lordships with this
objection, but it is in consequence of an opi-
nion that I am right; and if that be my se-
rious opinion, recollecting that I stand here
as prosecutor for the public, I am not at li-
berty, whatever my inclination might be, to
sacrifice what appears to my own mind to be
@ great principle in judicature, adopted and
acted upon for the benefit of the public, and,
therefore, for the benefit of every individual
who forms a part of it.

When my learned friend stated that he
had scen this objection brewing for some
days, he will allow me to state to him
what I do state upon my personal ho-
nour, if it be necessary for me to pledge
that to him, that so far from brewing this ob-
jection, I do state, that I do not look forward
enough into cases to anticipate such objec-
tions, for I protest I had not foreseen that
such evidence as this would be offered, and
had not considered it. But the learned and
able manner in which my friend has rea-
.soned upon it, I think of itself is some de-
gree of testimony in support of what I am
now saying, that it is an objection which, at
least, had colour enough in it to invite the
minds of two able counsel to apply their abi-
lities to repel the objection, if it should be
taken,

Having stated thus much—what your lord-
bell has heard with respect to the case of
Holt, and an expression which has fallen

from my learned friend in discussing this ob-
jection I hope will prevent its appearing to
those to whom I am now addressing myself,
improper to make this observation upon it.
When a motion was made for a new trial,
because Mr. Justice Wilson was supposed to
have rejected evidence which he ought to
have admitted, my learned friend, in the dis-
charge of the duty which he owed to his
client, contended as strongly that that evi-
dence was admissible, as
day that this evidence is admissible; and I
‘am perfectly persuaded that if any man had
Jeft the court after he had heard my friend,
he would have gone out of court with an opi-
nion, which I hope my friend will not be too
incautiously industrious in propagating, that
there was a difference in the law of evidence,
as it affected a newspaper printer at Newark,
and as it affected other persons whose paper
he proposed should be received in evidence.
My lord, I say incautiously do it—and I think
it my duty to say it, because when in the
course of a trial affecting the life of the per-
son who now stands at this bar, and not only
affecting his life, but affecting the interest
which every man in this country has in his


e has done this |

us)

own life, and affecting every interest that aa
be dear to him, I wish my learned {nec
would at once either decline talking of tk
difference between a poor shoe-maker ai
men of higher rank, or that he would su
the facts upon which he thinks it fit to bed
that sort of language. My lord, we livea
a country in which the providence of the law,
like the midenee ¥ God, is rer hs
high and low, rich and poor; and speakny
ior myself, I desire to be disgraced from ts
moment, if in the course of this trial, | either
have conducted myself, or can conduct mrs
in such a manner as not to do that justice &
this prisoner which the law means should te
done to him. 1 think I should be worthy oi
that death, and ten such deaths as the pn
soner must suffer, provided he is found guir
upon this trial.

Having said thus much, I proceed to su
to your lordships that undoubtedly I ast
that the questions with respect to the eft
of evidence, and the admissibility of evidence,
are perfectly distinct :—for instance, if in te
case of any person you find him at a tavert,
speaking respectfully of the hereditary »-
bility of the country, and of his majesty, 3
the situation and character which he holdst
this country; and you find, on the olx
hand, papers in which he holds  perlecty
different language upon other occasions;
fact whether he held that conversation at ts!
tavern or not, may or not be evidence
ing to the circumstances under which th!
conversation is held.

In the case now before the Court, your lort-
ships will recollect that it has been given 2
evidence that Mr. Tooke (one of the pers!
whose name occurs in this indictment) at the
Crown and Anchor, upon the 2nd of May,
1792, spoke with great respect of the hereditay
nobility of the country, and spokealsowith r-
pectof the majesty of theking. Whyisthater-
dence? clearly for this reason (without exam
ing whether it would be evidence forany ob
reason) namely, that it was a transactionof be
two societies met in the course of the buss
which they had been doing ; and it came ot
also upon the cross-examination, which 6
another circumstance that will require 0
materially attended to. So with respect
the prisoner at the bar—if, for instance,
has been evidence given of the effect of

ers, that the language which he ws
fold was to be such language as pi
would permit; — that be received psy
which were not communicated to the sodely:
and one private letter, in which a propos
is stated, that monarchy is to be ripped UP
by the roots; that in the answer to that it ¥
stated to those who held that conversst
with him about monarchy—do not talk
monarchy—do not talk about demo]
—let your language be confined vod
versal suffrage and annual parliaments °
all the rest of your objects will erg’
say there may be a great number of


circumstances given in evidence, but then
the question will follow, whéther the decla-
‘ ration the man held is given under such cir-
' cumstances at such time, and in the course

of a conversation which makes that declara-
' tion evidence.

Now with respect to lord George Gordon’s
ease, if I recollect rightly, the principle
upon which the declarations were received in
' evidence was this—that in that case the de-
* clarations were really a fact, for whatever
- declaration accompanies the transaction,

whatever declaration is a part of the transac-

tion that is done, is part of the fact that is
. doing, and upon that ground the declarations
were admitted; it does not weaken the ob-
: servation at all, that evidence was given in
’ that case, that lord George Gordon went to

some magistrate, or some other person,
: whilst the mob was over-ruling tbe civil
: power of the country, for any conversation
. that was held by lord George Gordon during
¢ the existence of these riots, and with refer-
: ence to them, he being a party in them, was
t a declaration made at the time, and upon all
, the principles of evidence, was, therefore,
- connected with the transaction.

With respect to the case stated last by my
learned friend—Crohagan’s case, I take that
to be as distinguishable from the present evi-
- dence upon the same principle, the object

was to prove the view with which the man
came into England ; he declared that he would
_ Gome into England to kill the king; he did
eome into England. Your lordship knows that
hismaking the declaration, thoughit would be
pimizhable in another way, yet still would not

e high treason, if he had not come into Eng-
land ; and, upon the whole of the evidence,
the coming into England made a part of the
transaction with the declaration he had made,
it was an overt act of high treason, because
it was then understood to be a fact done with
the intention which the indictment imputed.

My learned friend has said respecting
Rosewell’s sermon, that no sermon can be
high treason, I will not argue that, but I sub-
mit it is very dangerous to state that no ser-
mion can be high treason.——

Mr. Erskine.—I said no sermon could be
high treason, without being in pursuance of
some plan. |

Mr. Attorney General. —It is matter of
good fortune then that I have stated it. No
man in the world will suppose that I mean
any thing else than what I am now saying ;
—lIt does happen in the course of what coun-
scl are stating, that they may conceive them-
selves to say what did not fall from them.

Mr. Erskine.—I appeal to every body round
me, and the whole public that I did.—I ap-

al particularly to the whole bar.

Mr. Attorney General—Then I can only
say for myself what I am about to say for
my learned friend, that it happens to those
whose attention is called to the discussion of
subjects, that words now and then which

:


really fall from gentlemen do not strike the
ear of those to Eon they are addressed, who
ought to hear them; meaning at the same
time to say distinctly that I did not hear
them, but it is satisfaction sufficient to me
that my friend permits they should be
ut in.

What is the evidence in the case of Rose-
well, and many others to which my friend
has alluded? In the first place he has not
stated with respect to these trials who were
the witnesses that were allowed to speak to
these facts; he has not stated whether these
circumstances were asked upon cross-exami-
nation; he has not stated whether wit-
nesses were called to general character, and
then gave in evidence these circumstances,
in explanation of the general character which
they had given; he has not stated whether
the witnesses who spoke to these particular.
declarations were speaking to declarations
which did or did not pass in the course of the.
very transaction which these witnesses were
called to prove.

Iam not meaning to contend in this case,
that it may not be competent for my friend
to state every word that Mr. Hardy ever
said in the Corresponding Society—every
word that Mr. Hardy said in his correspon-
dence with every ater society; every word
that he ever said in the Constitutional So-
ciety; every word which it can be shown
upon the evidence proposed had a direct
connexion, or which can be properly or fairly
connected with the transaction now before
the Court; but what I object to is this—that
you should call a witness who was not a
member of any of these societies, a witness
who has already told the Court that he did
know but little of Mr. Hardy, that he did not
even know he was an associated member of
that society, any connexion with which the
Friends of the People had disavowed, and
that you should be permitted to ask that
witness, not this question, whether in the
course of any transaction connected -with the
subject now before the Court, Mr. Hardy
made a declaration that could be considered
asa part of that transaction, but that you
should ask that witness what were the decla-
rations of Mr. Hardy at any time, when he
may have scen him without connexion with
the subject which is the matter of the present
indictment; this will lead a great way; it is
not worth while to argue upon the effect of it,
for that will go another way; but I wish my
learned friends to consider a little if this evi-
dence is let in for a prisoner, it will possibly
lead to let in evidence against a prisoner. I
am persuaded Ido not do injustice when I
say that there may be cases, I will say no-
thing about the present case, because I ought
not; but there may be cases in which, if this
sort of evidence can be let in upon principle,
it may furnish a principle upon which I may
be obliged to offer that evidence which, ac-
cording to my present opinions about evidence,

I have not thought myself at liberty to offer
in this cause.

Mr. Solicitor General—I shall trouble your
lordships for the purpose of stating the extent
to which this principle may go; and your
lordships cannot but be aware how extremely
important it is to attend to the manner in
which questions of this sort have been per-
mitted to pass upon trials.—-They are often
not attended to, they are often thought un-
important upon particular trials, and there-
fore not objected to ;—nothing can show that
in a more striking light than the question
which Mr. Erskine stated to have been put in
Fitzharris’s case, “ whether the witness
thought the act with which he was charged,
was done with a treasonable intent,”—which
‘was the very question to be left to the jury.
Now that question having been put with-
outany objection to it, shows that in the
course of trials of this nature, things are fre-
quently passed over without objection which
ought to be objected to, especially on the
part of the crown, to whom itis constantly
attributed, in all trials of this nature, that
they are pressing the prisoner too far ;—that
sort of odium being constantly attempted to
be thrown upon every crown prosecution ;
those who are employed by the crown are
always extremely anxious not to raise objec-
tions, where they do not think that the ge-
neral necessity of public justice requires that
they should be raised. Now the objection here
I believe, is raised simply upon the grounds of
the general necessity of public justice; at
least, as for myself, and with that view
which I have conceived of the subject, I have
been so far from objecting to questions being
put, that I have sat silent till now during
almost the whole of this trial; but it strikes
me that the rules and principles of law, and
especially the law of evidence in criminal
matters, ought to be attended to with a very
considerable degree of care and caution, for
. unless they are attended to, it is impossible to
say to what length, upon the authority of what
has passed in particular cases the matter may
not be carried.

I have conceived that a question which
went to a particular fact, not relative to the
charge of the very fact which was in mii
never could in its nature be asked with a view
to ny the truth of the particular charge; ge-
neral character may be given in evidence,
general conduct may be given in evidence,
conduct being in effect part of character, but
I never did conceive, that in any case what-
ever, if a man was trying for any act whatever,
that you could give in evidence any particular
acts that he had done at any particular time,
under similar circumstances, and the question
which is now attempted to be put, appears to
me tobe of that/nature ; if this question can be
put, why may not the prisoner at the bar, give
In evidence every letter such he has ever
written to any person whatever, upon
litical subjects, in which he may have stated


‘his own objects in any way in which b
| thought proper, and, perlvaps, with avs
‘ to this very prosecution ;—it strikes me, thi:
this is considered, the danger of the ada»
sion of such evidence is considerable, ai
that it is contrary to all the principles uv
which Courts have proceeded.

If your lordships advert to the cases cts!
by Mr. Erskine, and see the manner in wie
he has stated them, I think your lonshy
will find that, except as far as inadvertesi
may have permitted questions to pass u
noticed, they do not press very hard upon tt:
case.

With respect to the case of lord Ger
Gordon, I have looked into it; having ue
trial before me, it does not appear to meta!
any one question was put with respect tott
words of lord George Gordon at any tut,

1 which did not, in effect, form part of bisa |
duct in the very transaction which wa t
question. Like the cry of a mob, for
stance, in pulling down a house, the gener
cry of a mob is given in evidence against it
prisoner, because it was a part of the trusx-

tion at the time. es

With respect to the other cases, I think *
will be found that the questions have ral
been upon the cross-examination of the ™
ness, and not upon any original exsminata
on the part of the prisoner himself, for it
purpose of showing by what he did at a
time, what was probably his intention dam |
another thing at another time. |

Mr. Erskine.—I hope you wil mtb |
offended at me for this interruption whet |
may amend your last observation :—They
all of them taken from the State Trials, asd
they are all spon original examinations

Mr. Solicitor General.—I will then slitle
advert to some of them: in Cornishsax ,
what wasit? He called several witness
testify his loyalty, and that he drank tk
King’s health ; does that warrant the questa
which the learned counsel was going to pul
Mr. Stuart with respect to Mr. bi a
cular object in a particular thing? For thas
the nature of the question hre was goingtop*

So in sir John Freind’s case, what are the
questions that were put? When you hae
been present in company, and they bave beet
speaking upon the subject of goveramest
what has he said or done? Why he us ©
say, “ forbear, I do not admit of apy
discourse ;” that is evidence of his gem
conduct with respect to the goveroment ol te
country, and with respect to his veiw
intentions as to that government; Mr.
ton, I think, says, although you would a8
comply with what was proposed to yu, i
you said you would never be concerned in
plot. Now I think that that expression ma!
have been upon a cross-examination, by 3
person who was called to give evidence

so. And what was the fact im si:
Freind’s case? Why the fact. was, that ita

Would ‘it be permitted upon a trial for
murder, for instance, to give in evidence,
that the prisoner said he would not commit a
gnurder ; and yet as far as I have any concep-
tion of this, as stated by my Jearned friend,
it was simply that evidence; and therefore [
think it must have been ypon a cross-exami-

ion—
ft. rskine.—I tell you it was not. ‘
Mr. Solicitor Generql.—Then I do not un-

: a Ersking—-I see you do not.
. Solicitor General—The manner, sir,

duct yourself towards me, in the course of
this trial has been such as reflects upon my
character. I wil not submit to any map for |

talk of

other person, propriety of conduct either ina
civil or criminal case; I believe, I know my |
duty in both as well as you do; and I
trust that I shall discharge it.

y lords, the next that was mentioned was |

there? In order to show his general affec-
tion to government, it was asked, how has he
‘behave at any general rejoicings? Is that
any thing more than evidence of general de-
portment?

‘With respect to Rosewell’s case, itseems to
me that that is in a great degree general de-
Rest alhouph Y

that there was a degree of inaccuracy jn per-
mitting the question to be put exactly as it
‘was put ; but the question really tended sim-
ply to this, whether his general deportment
‘was that of aman who was loyal and: at-
tached to the government of the country? and
nothing more. :

As for what my learned friend said with
Yespect to a sermon being, or nat, treason; I
think there wasa sermon which is mentioned
‘in the history of our country ;—I mean the
‘sermon preached by Dr. Shaw, at St. Paul’s
‘Cross, for the purpose of exciting the people to

‘rise against Edward the fifth, and put Richard

‘the third upon the throne, which wasas clear
an overt act of high treason as ever was com-
mitted. 1 mention this, because certainly the
words which my learned friend has said he
‘made usc of, did escape my ear, as well as the
‘attorney-general’s ; and, which shows that
they did escape my ear, I do assure him that
I have taken down, in the margin of my brief,
that vey case of Dr. Shaw, which I then re-
collected, and that I could not have taken it

down if I had conceived he had made use of

the words which he says he made use of, and
which I have no doubt he did, :

in that office, which my learned friend near
mé now holds, may not when it is produced
as an authority against them, have it said that
Mpon this trial (and a solemn one trust it
will be) such and such things were admitted
to be given jn evidence, and that therefore

these reasons it

J must confess, that it}
ikewise was a case in which I should think |

Under these circumstances, from the neces-

sity that there is that in such a case as this a
rule should be laid down which can be pro-
perly pursued—A rule which men may un-
derstand, and, calling upon your lordships at-
tention that we objected

sporting the prisoner’s general conduct; also

to no questions re-

leclaring that, for myself, in the view which ]

have of the case, I would rather have the
question asked than not, yet for the sake of
generyl justice, for the sake of what is to be

one in future trials, and that other persons

such evidence ought always to be given; for
joes seem to me Important,
that your lordships should lay down some rule

upon the subject.

Mr. Bower.—Notwithstanding we are now
not only in a criminal case, but ina case
which affects the life of the prisoner at the

bar, I make no apology at all for troublin

our Jordships with the few observations

have to offer, because I not only am conscious
that neither myself, nor any one gentleman,
with whom I am associated in this prosecu-
tion, can possibly conceive the purpose of
pressing any evidence against the prisoner
which we do not think is competent evidence,
but I am confident that there does not exist
acreature, about whose opinion I am anxious,
that can conceive such a purpose to enter into
the heart of any of us. :

My lords I conceive that this case, capital
as itis, is to be tried upon the same principles
of evidence as all other cases are; and it is
our duty, as counsel for the prosecution, to
resist the admission of any evidence which we
think not competently legal, as much asif we
were trying a common action of assault and
battery, or as if @ question could arise upon
any subject that could possibly be -debated in
acourt of justice, which imagination could
conceive to be the most trifling.

‘Ihave always understood, that the decla-
rations of parties are evidence only either in
cases where they accompany the act at the
time that they are made, or where they have
been made at different times, and under differ-
ent circumstances, totally unconnected with
that fact, which is the question under discus-
sion in the Court, in which cases they have
always been received in the nature of facts, or
rather as circumstances by which the general
conduct of the party is to be judged of, as be-
ing circumstances, and being declarations
given upon subjects to answer no particular
purpose, and not connected with that which
is the subject matter of discussion at the time
that the evidence is given.

Every case my friend, Mr. Erskine, bas
cited, in my opinion, confirms the principle I
am now stating; andif your lordship will ex-

aA

amine them, one by one, you will find that in
every case, which he has stated, where evi-
dence of this kind has been received, it has
been to show the general conduct and cha-
racter of the prisoner, in circumstances and
upon occasions no way connected with the
crime of which he was then accused, but as
‘circumstances and declarations in situations
from which the jury might collect the general
character and conduct oF the prisoner.

It is indisputably true, that in the case of
murder, evidence has always been received
that the prisoner has at other times, upon
other occasions, and in different circumstances
shown acts of kindness to the deceased, and
expressed himself kindly towards him, and
they are offercd to show that that was the ge-
neral disposition of the prisoner towards the
deceased, from which the jury may collect
that it could not be his intention to commit
the crime which was imputed to him ;—but
did any man alive ever hear it asked of a wit-
ness, produced in a case of that kind, whether
he had heard the prisoner say, that he had
No intention to kill the deceased ; and that
that should be received as evidence, to explain
the acts which were proved against the pri-
soner, upon the evidence given; and upon
which the judgment of the Court and jury are
to be drawn?

In Holt’s case, which my learned friend has
cited, in which he has admitted that the judg-
ment of the Court of King’s-bench, went
slong with the opinion of a learned, and most
worthy judge, deceased—it appears that the
judges were unanimous in thinking, when the
fact was proved that the libel was published,
that it was not competent to the defendant to
explain his conduct, to state how, or in imita-
tion of whom it was, that he had done that
act which was then attributed to him as a
crime.

_ Inlord George Gordon’s case, the declara-
tions there received, come under the other
Principle, they were properly received, because
all of them were declarations immediately
preceding or following the act, so as to be con-
sidered as accompanying the acts of the mo-
ment—they were reccived upon the principle
that declarations accompanying a fact, are a
part of the fact itself; and that therefore you
must receive them as circumstances of the
fact; but there were neither received in evi-
dence, nor offered, the private declarations
made by that noble lord, previous to the time
when he entered into that levying war, which
constituted the crime of which he was ac-
cused.

In the other casé, which Mr. Erskine has
stated, where the prisoner was permitted to
ask what a person had heard him disclose ;
that is on the principle of going to the general
conduct—it was not with an intent to show
that particular act, which is attributed as a
crime in the prisoner, but to show that in for-
mer acts, which were considered as a part of
bjs general conduct, the prisoner's disposition


[tee

was such and such upon certain subjects, nt
connected immediately, not apologizing fr,
and not offered as explanatory of the
transactions which made the subject matter of
the crime, with which he was ig ig

In lord Russell’s case, when Dr. Borne
was asked to a conversation of lord Russelfs
against risings, which comes nearer than any
my friend has stated, to the principle he wants
to support—lIs it stated in that case, that my
declaration lord Russell had made with respet
to his intention, as to the rising in questea,
or the facts that he was called to answer to
was received as evidence—nothing like it-
when aman is charged with a particular r-
sing, which constitutes the particular fact o
which he is accused, evidence of his genml
conduct, and general character, d H
of other facts, and other circumstancesare of
fered to prove—not what he said respecting
the fact there—but as general evidence of the
conduct and intention of the party.

As to Rosewell’s case, which was, that
clergyman who had taken occasion to inst
the government, had at other times preached
sermons in favour of government, that coms
within both principles ; the preaching a di
course in favour of government at another
time, is an act done strongly indicative of the
intentions, and general conduct of the pri-
soner, to show that he was well disposed we
wards povethiaent, and I give my learned
friend leave, if he can in this instance, ©
prove five hundred acts, to show that Mr.
Hardy has always supported government,aot
hasin his general conduct, done acts a3 D>
torious as the preaching of'a sermon in ap
port of order, and good government.

The case a sir ze Freind was of the
same kind; the evidence was not to prow
what he had done respecting the particur
transaction, but to show that at  differst
times, when there could be no design in ve",
the conversation not respecting the crime
which he was then accused, sir John Freint
had been speaking of government in the "J
that a dutiful subject ought todo.

In Dammaree's case, the declarations 1
ceived were directly accompanying the st:
the declarations of the mob were received 35
part of the act, and upon that principle oaly.

The case last alluded to was, I believe, Cr-
hagan’s case, in which was given in evi
against him, his declarations of coming ©
England, to kill the king ; and his coming»
England coupled with other acts, to
what his intention was; and there was
declaration to explain the particujar act,
which he at that time was accused, or which
was then the subject matter of inquiry.

; I have before stated j= om which 4

learned friend Mr. Gi

cently, and as he always does, very abl bl
to expressious of good will, that is 14%
which I do not deny, but the applicst#o
which I dispute, because I say that these &

pressions of good will, are only received i

the way that I have before stated, namely,
that they are expressions at other times, upon

occasions, when there is no crime im-
puted, when they cannot be possibly supposed
to have relation to any crime, not then com-
mitted, or about to be committed, and which
only shows a general good disposition—
which in an equivocal act might make it
doubtful, whether the party was actuated by
malice toward the deceased, or not.

But the evidence offered in this case, is of a
very different complexion indecd,and such as I

ly speak truly when I say I do not recollect
ever to have been offered to a court of justice.
The crime charged is, compassing the king’s
death—we can give no evidence of the manner
of compassing the death of the king, but by
the overt acts which we have charged, and
therefore the subsiance of the indictment is,
that you did this overt act, from which this
compassing necessarily arises; it is the act I
admit to show the intent, which is just like
any other fact, in any other case; it is just
the same, as when we say a man committed
a homicide with a felonious intent; the intent
is a part of the crime—but was it ever asked,
whether he had said he committed that
crime, with a felonious intent?—it is from the
acts that he has done, that you are to judge
of the fact; and you cannot suffer him, by his
declarations, to explain that act, by saying
that he did not do it with a felonious intent
—I see no difference; the intent is coupled
with the act in both cases, as in all it is no-
thing more than this, that from the facts the
intent must be inferred—from the facts here
the traitorous intent must be inferred. It
would not be competent to a man indicted for
murder to say that lie did not do the homicide
feloniously ; that he did not intend to kill the
man—and it is no more evidence here when
certain acts have been done, which we insist
upon necessarily aitord a certain conclusion of
fact, to say that he intended to do any one act
with a different intent from that which is
Proved by evidence to be the intent with
which he acted. It appears to me, therefore,
that upon no principle, and upon no autho-
rity can the evidence now offered be received,
any more than it could be received if it were
a declaration—I did not intend to commit a
felonious murder, when I did the act.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Mr. Erskine, I
do not know whether you can be content to ac-
seek in the opinion that we are inclined to
form upon the subject, in which we go a cer-
tain way with you. Nothing is so clear as
that all declarations which apply to facts, and
even apply to the particular case that is
charged, though the intent should make a part
of that charge, are evidence against a prisoner
and are not evidence for him, because the
Presumption upon which declarations are evi-
dence is, that no man would declare any
thing against himself, unless it were true ;
but that every man, if he was ina difficulty,

or in the view to any difficulty, would make


declarations for himself. Those declarations,
if offered as evidence, would be offered, there-
fore, upon no ground which entitled them to
credit. That isthe general rule. But if the
question be,—as I really think it is in this
case, which is my reason now for interposing,
—ifthe question be, what was the politic
speculative opinion which this manentertained
touching a reform of parliament, I believe we
all think that opinion may very well be learned
and discovered by the conversations which he
has held at any time, or in any place.*

Mr. Erskine.—Just so, that is my question;
only that I may not get into another debate, [
beg your lordship will hear me a few words.

rd Chief Justice Eyre—I think I have
already anticipateda misapprehension of what
Iam now stating, by saying that if the decla=
ration was meant to apply to a disavowal of
the particular charge made against this man,
that declaration could not be received ;—as
for instance, if he had said to some friend of
his, when I planned this convention I did not
mean to use this convention to destroy the
king and his government, but I did mean to
et by means of this convention, the duke of
ichmond’s plan of reform—that would fall
within the rule I first laid down; that would
be a declaratiog, which being for him, he
could not be admitted to make, though the
law will allow a contrary declaration to have
been given in evidence. Now, if you take it
so, I believe there is no difficulty.

Mr. Erskine.—In the first place I cannot
help lamenting that I have been throughout
this whole business very considerably misun-
derstood. IfI had no other reason for it,—
but I have another reason which I will show
presently,—but if 1 had no other reason, ina
place so very public as this, itis fit that I
should say a few words to the Court.

I agree with Mr. Solicitor General that very
frequently an improper odium falls upon coun-
sel; no man can cast his eye upon the State
Trials without seeing that an improper odium
has fallen upon counsel conducting causes for
the crown, in consequence of that humanity
which has ever been the characteristic of the
English nation, Thinking so, I did that
which, perhaps, would have been better here-
after: I went out of my way, and notwith-
standing my weak state of health, spoke at
some length, and with some anxicty, lest
any man should suppose for a moment
that I meant to make any such insinuation
against any of the gentlemen at the bar—
what return I have met with I leave to others

* See this question again discussed in the
Arguments and Judgment as to the admissi-
bility of extracts from a letter from Mr. ‘fooke
to lord Ashburton, on the trial of John Horne
also, as there referred to, what lord Ellenbo-
rough said (in the case of Lambert and
Perry, for alibel 4. p. 1810, post) concerning
the admission of evidence of this sort.

who have heard it, to jud

ges without making
any observation upon it, bec:

ause it is not for
your lordship to redress it.

With regard to Mr. Solicitor General, thus
much I have a right to say, and I am bound
for myself to say it, I think that any man who
improperly gives offence to another, very
much forgets the character that ought to be-
Jong to him ; and if I had given any just of-
fence to Mr. Solicitor General, I should have
been the first man without any complaint
from him to have given hint satisfaction for
it; but on the contrary, I have a right to
complain of him, for when he had asserted
(I took it for granted, from not having heard
what I said) that all the cases I cited were
upon cross-examination, I thought it would
be unmanly in me afterwards to take advan-
tage of that remarkin my reply; therefore, in
order to enable the gentleman to make such
observation upon the cases I cited as would
belong to them, when he stated that they

‘were upon cross-examinations, out of a proper :

courtesy, and from that which belonged to
the dignity of the bar, I told him that they
were on original examinations, and I should
have thought that would have satisfied Mr.

Solicitor General that they were so; for Ij

Stated in the course of what I said, that I had

personally collected them, and that they were |

bn original examinations, After that Mr.
Solicitor General goes on, and with great
emphasis says, I shall still think that they
‘vere on cross-cxamination ; I wrote it down,
and every gentleman in court heard it; upon
which I said I aver again that they were on
original examination: “ then,” he said, ah
do not understand them ;” to which I sai
“ T see you do not.” Why I would say that to
any man that ever existed, here, or any where
—if a mantells me that what I aver is not so,
I would say to that man what I will not say
here. So much for that.

The attorney-general says that the over-rill-
‘ing Providence of God superintends alike the
Tich and the poor in this country, as indeed
it does over the whole world, and he seemed
‘to be offended, after 1 had read from the State
Trials, what had been allowed in some illus-
trious cases to noblemen, and some of the first
men in the kingdom, that I should speak,
feeling as I must feel, if I were not worse
than any man whose name is to be found in
the State Trials, fecling someting for the pri-
soner ;—an allowance ought to be made for
‘counsel for prisoners, as well as for pri-
soners themselves; that I should make men-
tion of this poor shoe-maker ;—buthad 1 not
excluded every idca of offence to the attorney-

neral? Could he think, with the particular
‘Kindness with which 1 have gone out of the
way to speak of him in the whole’of the cause, ,

‘could any man think that I meant to bring’
back again that odium upon the counsel for.
the crown which I had sought zealously to,
‘take off, and which I thought it my duty to}

do out of respect'to the attorhey-zeneral? but told ‘ne, that ydir society

it furnishes mé with tHis obdervation, whi
if there was, what I think there if tu,
Fg the prisoner, it might serve hith ;-#t
shows us how little dependetice is to be hid
upon words, and how little it is evidence k
high treason what men who are warn wil
say, because we who were thus ier be
who might be imagined to be really disa!
to ohe another, are persons who Iive in social
life together, on terms of affection and regard;
and, therefore, I am glad this happens, be
¢ause persons may see how little we ought
’ depend upon what may be said by Mr. Yorke,
or any other man, when found heated att
tavern, or at an alehouse.
This question refers to 4 period previow t
the time of holding the convention, beh

“the convention was thought of, in order ¥

show clearly that this person’s opinion, sd
that his object in being a member of the Co.
responding Society, and the secretary, was ¥
bring about the duke of Richmond’s object,
and by the duke of Richmond’s means. If
the Court will put that question I have done.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.— You may put the
question exactly as you propose; I confes!
wished by interposing to avoid all discussiot,
because I consider what we are doing, std
whom we have at that bar, and in tht
box, whoare suffering by every moment's th
necessary delay in such a cause as this.

Mr. Erskine.—I am sure the jury will er
cuse it; I meant to set myself right st us
bar: this is a very public place.

Mr. Daniel Stuart examined by Mr. Erskine

Did you before the time of this convention
being held, which is imputed to Mr. Hardy,
ever hear from him what his objects were—
whether he has at all mixed hiniselt in that
business?—I have very often conversed wih
him, as I mentioned before, about his plan
of reform; he always adhertd to the duke f
Richmond’s plan, and said that will be the plas
that will be adopted in the end; I disagreed
with him about that, and that occasioned t
more particularly to be marked in my at
mory ; we disputed about it, and he slways
obstinately adhered toit, and stated that wte
the object of the society, and his whole o>

ject.

y Was this said in the confiderice of priratt
regard, or in public company, where it might
be said ostentatiously ?—I was never in pab-
lic company with him ; he aud another pers
were with me one night, and I have had bons
and frequent conversations with him upoa
‘subject. ;

From all that you have seen of him, wint
is his character for sincerity and truth?
have every reason to believe him to be s vey
sincere, siniple, honest man.

Mr. Attorney General.—If this had bea
stated at first to be the question meant to
askell, I do tot see what possible objectien 1
¢guld have to it. Mr. Stuart, you bave before

iad rejected oll

correspondence Wit the Constititional 8d
ciety ?—Yes.

Did you know, or had the prisoner ever told
‘ you, that he was an associated thémber of
‘that society ?—I did not know it, andI ath
| very sure he never told me.

! Mr. Erskine.—I am gi
‘convention in Scotland, because your lord-
: ship recollects the idea of a British Conven-
' tion came originally by proposition from Scot-
‘ Jand ; it was not set on foot by either of the
: two societies in England.
' Lord Chief Justice Eyre. — Recollecting
. what I do of the fact, I cannot concede that
: fact to you.
Mr. Erskive—We conceive that upon the
' evidence it is so, but we will suppose for the
present that it was not, still it was 4 conven-
tion which was held, ‘not in England, but in
Scotland, and the principal persons assembled
in it were of that country, though upon ge-
neral invitation detegates were sent from
England to it. Now it becomes material in
the consideration of this evidence to tnake
this observation—the overt act charges this
to be a convention held for the purpose of
subverting the rule, order, and government
of the country. I seems not to have been |
sufficiently attended to lately that that is the |
overt act, for in the course of the debate that
is just finished, it looked as if it was assumed |
that the overt-act was the holding a conven-
tion, but the overt-act is not for holding a con-
vention, for any two or three people that get
together may be a convention; but it isa:
convention held for & ‘particular purpose, in
pursuance of another purpose, which the ih-
dictment says ‘was, to subvert the govern-:
meht.— That fs ‘the charge. Now I'think 1:
have the authority of one of ‘your lordships
since this triul cante 'on, for & papain,
which, indeed, does not want stich high au-
thority to-stipport it, that a convention may
meet for legal purposes. Much has heen re-;
lied wpoh in the course of the arguthent of
phrases ‘being ‘used from which you shrink)
back at ‘this tite, ds applicable to France ;,
the pHrases of Citizen—Convention—Honour- .
able mention, and so on. Now what I offer:
in evidence is to show ‘the ‘jury, as matter of |


il

fact (yout lordsHip tepulating the trial ac.
cording to the rules of law) that there were

sitting at the time, and had sat before that
time, and immediately before that time, two
most respectable bodies of men, one of them
consisting of delegates from ali the different
counties of Scotland, fot obtaining a reforin in
the Commons House of Parliament, and the
ther & convertion of delegates ftom boroughs
associated for a similar purpose. Here again
I beg it may be understood, just asin the casé
ef the duke of Richmond, that I am not
tiaras argue that, because a convehtion
was held before that timé by persons of any
Gescription, for purposes such as expressed in
that bouk, and which this gentleman, as @
member, was a party to that, although these
resolutions should carry with them a simila-
rity to some that have been complained of in
this case, that the quality of those that were
complained of is at all altered by similarity to
those that are not; but that when we are to
decide what was the intention of calling this
meeting & cotivention, and to rebut the pre-
sumption that they necessarily must, or might
be supposed to have meant to stand upon the
footing ofthe government of France, in calling
their meeting a convention, and in having
delegates from different societies, they were

rsuing the same forms which not only had

nm before that time pursued, but in fact
were im the course of being pursued at the
same time. The gentleman now called having
been a member of that ‘convention, the pto-
ceedings of which assembly I now propose to
lay before the Court, and that at that time it
was @ thing universally notorious in Scotland,
that there were associations for those pur-

oses.

Mr. Gibbs.—We offer this as evidence of
the fact, that there did exist meetings m
Scotland which had the name of a conven-
tion of delegates, at the time Mr. Erskine
has stated. .

Lord Chief Justice Eyre —Is it consented
‘to on the part of the crown P

Mr. Aftorney Generul —1 object to it, and
will state to your lordship why I do dbject to

it—————

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—I should be
unwilling to admit ‘it, if it were expressly
consented to, because it would lead the jury
from that which belongs to their considera
tion, into a history with which we have no-
thing todo. The duke of Richmond’s plan
ts connected with the evidence, and therefore
it was proper to be prodiiced, because twenty
‘witnesses have referred to that plan as the
very grounds of their proceeding; but whe-
ther a set of gentlemen who assembled,
called themselves by 8 particular name, or
what passed in Scotland, or what passed in
Treland ; for upon the same principle you may
go to that, or to what ‘passed all over the
world, for any thing I know, ‘but it entirely
‘earties us from ‘the point, arid has in my
opinion, to soft ef connexion with the case.

Me Erskine.—I submit to the judgment
of the Court whenever I hear it.

Joseph Strutt, esq. sworn-—Examined by
Mr. Gibbs.

“Where do you live ?—At Derby.
Are you a member of the society there? —

es.

What are the objects of that society ?—A
reform in the Commons House of Parlia-
ment.

- Had you any view with respect to the
other branches of the legislature, either to
the King, or the Lords ?—No.

Had you, or had any of the members of
your society, to your knowledge, any intent
to bring about that reform by force ?—O dear,
no—so far from it, that our society has never
met since the petition to parliament was re-
jected.

Joseph Strutt, esq. cross-examined by Mr.
: Attorney General,

. After the petitions to parliament were re-
jected, your society has not met?—I think
Got once.
Mr. Erskine,—I will state to your lordship
that I also meant to offer another piece of
evidence, in order that I may receive the
judgment of the Court upon its admissibility.
{ shall present to the Court all that we con-
ceive it our duty to present, leaving it to your
lordship to decide upon the admissibility,
which 1s matter of law. I was instructed to
offer to your lordship evidence of associations
in the year 1780 for similar purposes, followed
up by resolutions extremely similar to many
of those which have occupied much of the
attention and consideration of the Court. I
-will net take up your lordship’s time with
stating at length the principle upon which 1
offer it, because I have so often stated it al-
ready ;—namely, that when we are trying the
intention of the persons who held those asso-
sciations, that it might be seen whether they
were not following the example, no matter
whether legally or illegally, of great men in
their own country, instead of being supposed
to be copying persons in another country,
from whom they were totally distinct.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre——What should I
say to it if I should be of opinion that the
associations of that year were high treason?

Mr. Erskine—That cannot be, for there is
no such thing as high treason in point of law,
unless the party has in his mind an intent to
compass the king’s death. :

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—One might be
compelled, for aught I can tell, to say so.

Mr. Erskine.—It would be very difficult, I
-confess, to persuade any body that almost all
the great persons in this country have been
in a course of committing high treason.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I do not impute
it to them, I only say that nothing that was
done by any set of men ten years ago, -or at
apy other time, with welch these persons


{tl00

had no connexion, and to which they have
not in any manner referred, can possibly in-
fluence the present case ; we cannot ingui
into that transaction, or say any thing

it.

Mr. Erskine.—Mr. Sheridan, as your lor-
ship very well knows, is amember of the Hous
of Commons, I will call him to prove, that be
was about to bring before the House an inquiry
into any conspiracy that there might beagains
the government upon this subject now under
examination; that he saw the prisoner at the
bar, and had communication with him long,
long before the papers in his custody were
seized, which are now turned inte evidence
against him, as papers found clandestinely in
his custody as a criminal. I call Mr. She
ridan to prove, if the fact be so, that Mr.
Hardy offered to come forward to give al
assistance, to lay every thing voluntarily be
fore the parliament in examination of this
matter, which has since been made the sub
ject of inquiry in a court of criminal justice.
I produce this evidence because it affordss
presumption of his innocence,

Richard Brindsley Sheridan, esq. swom—
Examined by Mr. Erskine.

Do you know the prisoner at the bar!—I
saw the prisoner once, and but once, I think,
to my knowledge. .

When was that?—I think in the beginniog
of the month of March, 1793.

Upon what occasion was it that you 9
him ?—I had given notice in the Hous of
Commons that I intended very shortly »
bring forward a motion, the object of whicd
was similar to that which was adopted ia the
last session; namely to propose a committe
to inquire inito the seditions or plots, and the
general proceedings of the societies w!
were then sy ised to be promoting seditna
or treason in the country. : . .

At that time was the convention which
had been assembled in Scotland sitting, ¢
had it been dispersed ?—I do not recollect.

Epes that occasion did you send for Mt.
Hardy, or did he wait upon you?—I sent to
him.” I will state very shortly what I unde-
stand from the conversation which pas
and which, I have been informed, 1s mate
for the prisoner. Having given this nox
in the House of Commons, I thought it my
duty to make every inquiry I could into the
fact of the existence of these seditious soc
ties, and into their conduct, being ay:
certainly a great disbeliever in the sup a,
plots, to the extent to which they were stat
or of the conspiracies which were suppost®
be brewing in this society.—I conve
a gentleman upon the subject; he veg
other modes of inquiry, named to me Fr
Hardy, and he stated him as a person ¥
he conceived incapable of giving into an
plans, and who, he thought, could give aid
every information upon subject. 1

I should be glad to see him: Mr. Hardy *


‘cordingly came to me. I took the precau-
tion, not. certainly arising from any thing
that I heard of the character of Mr. Hardy,
to have two gentlemen present at the conver-
sation, one of which was Mr. Stuart, who
was lately examined; I showed Mr. Hardy a
publication which had been delivered at the
doors of the House of Commons, and of the
House of Lords, reporting the proceedings
and the addrésses of those sgcieties, and
giving a list of the different public houses at
which the societies met; he went over that
book with me, and complaint that it calum-
zat the society he belonged to, and its
eedings—— ;
lod Chief Justice Eyre.—It is not quite
regular to go into a general narration, which
nay inte luce a great deal of matter which
will not be evidence ; the point you are called
upon to prove is that Mr. Hardy, upon your
conversing with him, offered to assist you in
disclosing every thing he knew, and to assist
you in bringing forward the inquiry, because
asto his declaration beyond that it may not
‘be evidence.—I certainly will confine myself
to ‘that ;—-I should say that Mr. Hardy: ob-
served that the information apparently ob-
tained by government was extremely accu-
rate; that the places mentioned as their
places of meetings were extremely correct;

e afterwards said that the object of the
society was very much mis-stated, for that
they had nothing in view but a parliamen
teform according to the plan of the duke of
Richmond.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Not what his
conduct was upon it—his opinion. :

. Me. Erskine—What his object was upon
it

Mr. Sheridan.—Mr. Erskine stated the in-
tention of calling me was to that point; but
if I was misled in adding something to it that
was not evidence, it was from the fact of a
witness just now at the bar having expressly
stated that circumstance himself, as having
passed between him and Mr. Hardy.

Mr. Erskine.—I should not have presumed
to have a§ked Mr. Stuart the question, What
was the object of the society? without your
lordship’s permission, but he said that Mr.
Hardy declared his own object, and that of
the society to be, a parliamentary reform upon
the duke of Richmond's plan.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—The declaration
of the object of the society, and how it was
to be pursued, may be a very different thing.

Mr. Erskine—What did he declare the
object of the society to be?—The whole object
of the society, and his own ohject to be,
obtaining by peaceable means, a parliamen-
wy teform upon the duke of Richmond’s

D.

Will you be so good as state what assist-
ance he offered you ?—He went through the
list of these places, and upon my interroga-
ting him, certainly not Presuming that Te
was bound to answer the question, upon

t


asking him the fact, whether these societies,
having been dispersed, they continued to
meet at these public houses ; he declared they
did not; that in consequence of this publica-
tion of government these houses considered
themselves as marked, and stating that their
members were not persons who spent much
money at public houses, that without much
reluctance the landlords of those houses had
refused to let them meet at their houses. I
asked him if they still continued to meet, he
said distinctly that they did; that he knew
they were watched by government, and had
no objection to its being known that all the
societies continued to meet in private houses,
and he had no objection, he said, to give me
the list of the houses where they met, for my
information, and that I might read it, if I
pleased, in the House of Commons.

Did he know at this time that you had in-
tended making a motion in the House of
Commons upon the subject ?—I told him that
satel ; I took down a great many of the
private houses where he said they met; I
dare say I did not preserve the paper, but I
had it in my hand when J moved the next
day in the House of Commons for a com-
mittee to inquire into the conduct of these
societies.

Whether in stating the pursuit which par-
liament had in view, he offered you any far-
ther assistance that might eventually be ne-
cessary in the investigation of all that in fact
had been done?—He offered me every assist-
ance and information in his power—he of-
fered me a sight of the whole correspondence,
copies of all his letters, if 1 chose it, and ex-
pressed an eaee wish that my motion might

e successful for an inquiry into the conduct
of these societies. .

I observe you have been pet durin;
most of these proceedings; I wish to as
whether he fisted you a sight of those

apers which have been seized, and you have
Foerd read here.in evidence.—He offered me
a sight of the whole of his papers, and every
book in his possession.

Was that in consequence of any demand
of yours, peremptorily as a member of parlia-
ment, or a magistrate, or was it a voluntary
offer on his part, considering you as a private
member of parliament?—Certainly a volun-
tary offer, appearing to me to arise froma
very sincere wish, on his part, that an inves-
tigation might be instituted.

Richard Brindsley Sheridan, esq. cross-ex=
‘amined by Mr. Attorney General.

I understand that this was in the begin-
ning of the year 1793?—I think in March,
1793, I made the motion, and I am pretty
confident this conversation was the very
evening before I made the motion.

Did I understand you right, that you show-
ed him some book ?—I showed him a book, a
publication supposed to proceed from the trea-
sury, which had been delivered to the mem-

bers of both Houses, and which he complained
yery much calumpiated the proceedings of
these societies.

He did not offer to show you a book that
was a Journal of their proceedings ?—He of-
fered to show me the abo of the papers and
books of his society.

Do you take upon yourself to say that he
offered to show you books, or a book, or any
Journal ?—He offered in general to give every
information as to the proceedings which be
could give; he said he had no concealment,
that he wished to show me any papers, books,
or proceedings of the society; I cannot recol-
lect whether he said a book or books, but I
must be understood when I say he offered ge-
nerally to give me every information ia hi
power.

T understood you that he meant to give you

all the written information that in the begin- |

ning of the year 1798 he could give; but I
have an important reason for desiring that he
mey not be prejudiced by your recollection,
when yau state the ward Jaurnal or Book.—
Did he offer to give you the correspondence
and a Journal or Book ?—It is impossible for
me to say that he-used-the word Journal, or
whether he said Book, or Books; but I am
positive in the recollection that he offered to
show me the papers of the Corresponding So-
ciety.

No Book or Journal of the Corresponding
Society has been produced; I svish, therefore,
to know whether yqu mean -yoursclfto say
that he did mention ‘the word’ J wrnal, or the
‘word :Book, because I wish if yaur recollection
is not accurate.to,the ward Journal ar Book,
hat that expression may be dropped, jnas-
much as that a bate may give rise to an
observation ?—I have just distinctly said that
I am not positive whether he said Journal
or Book, but his offer was to.show ,me all the
papers and other correspondence, and to .con-
ceal nathing fram me; how, he made that offer
ZT cannot expressly recollect, hut the impres-
sion.on my mnind was that he meant to with-

_ hold nothing from me, but ,to give me what-
ever materials were in his power, ,whether
Rooke, taoals or whatever they might be.

a utterly adverse to the prayer of it,

then, and when I saw bim in his sbop. Upon

: Stating these objections, Mr. Margarot and

the other two were very ready, and their
readiness surprised me, in maintaining the
arguments that might be urged on the part

' of universal representation. I expressed my

surprise that men of their rank in life should
have the command of such arguments, they
said it was not surprising, for they only follows
ed the opinions of the duke of Richmond,
and they said whatever my opinion might be,
Lcould hardly make it better. Upon my mak-
ing this difficulty to present their petition, and
stating that, instrict parliamentary propriety, a
petition to the House ought to leave the re-
medy, whatever it might be, in general terms
‘to the wisdom of the House; and that even if
I had approved their idea of universal repre-
sentation, I should have recommended them
to leave the prayer of their petition open ina
general way; they said that for their part, I
felievs Mr. Hardy took it upon himself when
he said this, and I took notice of the quiet-
ness, moderation, and simpticity of the man,
as well as bis good sense; he said in return
to that, that he was sorry they had not known
my vbjection sooner, or to that effect. [have
had occasion to recite the circumstances now
stated tu the Court upon another occasion,
which makes me more accurate concerning
them; some time ago when I was called upon

to mention them.at .a meeting of our own so-



ciety; I mention that only to account for be-
ing so accurate, they said they were sorry they
had not known my objections sooner, that it
would have been indifferent to them whe-
ther they should have stated the prayer as
they had done, or lett it open; but that now
they could not alter it, because the petition
wasalready signed by a great number, I believe
nine thousand ; that it must be presented that
day, the 6th of May, because on that day Mr.
Grey had given notice of his motion concerning
a reform of parliament, and it was indispensa-
bly necessary it should be presented that day,
that made it impossible they could alter the
prayer of the petition, being signed by great
numbers. I said very well, they knew my
thoughts upon the subject, and if they were
content that I should present their petition,
making that declaration concerning the
prayer of it, I was ready to do it ;—accordingly
I did so, and stated to the House my objec-
tion to it,

Had it not been that the forms of the
House would not admit of the time, did there
appear a readiness and willingness to have
made it conformable to your recommenda-
tion?—Yes, remarkably so; and I was very
glad to have that to state to the House.

Philip Francis, esq. cross-exarained by Mr.
Attorney-General.

You have said that there was a remarkable
readiness to have changed the prayer of the
petition, if there had been time enuugh?~I
thought so. .

Wad you any reason to believe (indeed I
am almost ashamed to ask the question)—had
you any reason to believe at the time that
they waited upon you with this petition, that
they had no anxiety at all about the success
of it?—On the contrary, they seemed very
eager about it. There is a circumstance
which I do not know whether it is material.
Mr, Hardy told me they had asked Mr. Fox to
present this petition, and that he had de-
clined it, because he was an enemy to unl-
versal suftrage.

I believe that was mentioned in the letter
to you?—And that Mr. Fox had declined it
because he disagreed with them in the prayer
of the petition.

Then in effect, as it struck your mind, they
appeared extremely desirous that the petition
should be presented, and were extremely wil-
ling that the prayer should be altered accord-
ing to your ideas, if time would have per-
mitted ?—They were extremely desirous to
have it presented, and very ready to have left
it generally to the wisdom of the House. I
am pretty sure, indeed I am certain, that
they for their parts, would have been very
well contented to have left itso, if they had
been sooner upprized of the forms of the

House.

They held the language then of men de-
sirous to have a parliamentary reform to the
extent the wisdom of parliamont could give

4B

mi

it them, and not to use a language which
amounted to a determination to accept of no-
thing less than universal suffrage and annual
parliaments?—They did not give up, as the
object of their wishes, universal suffrage and
annual representation, but what they were
ready to give up, and did give up, was, to
‘change the form of the prayer of their petition.

I dare say they did not express to you their
determination that they would accept nothin
from the legislature but universal suffrage an
annual parliaments ?—Certainly not—I would
Not have had any thing to do with them if
they had usedsthat language.

I think you said they had determined to
print their letter of thanks to you?—That was
sometime hefore.

You told them you totally disapproved of
the method of universal suffrage and annual
representation?-—Yes ; that was on the 6th of
May.

Did you happen to know that they had
published what you desired should not be
published, together with a pretty strong letter
preceding, which I will show you?—No; I
do not think they did at all publish it, at least
Not in a newspaper.

Please to see if this is an accurate copy of
the answer you sent them ?—[showing it to
Mr. Francis.]—I believe it is.

Is the letter which precedes it the letter
you received before you presented the peti-
tion ?—I dare say it is, but I had totally forgot
the letter.

Have you any doubt about it?—No, I have

not; I see now plainly that they had totally
mistaken me,

“ Sir ;—The Committee of Delegates of the
London Corresponding Society, having perused
with considerable pleasure your truly patriotic
speech of the 10th instant, in favour of a ra-
dical reform in the representation of the people,

think it incumbent on them, as friends to re- |

form on that broad basis, for which you have
so ably contended, toreturn you their sincerest
thanks, and to express their obligations for
your support of a cause, to which their every

exertion has long been devoted. United as |

we ure upon the firmest and most patriotic
principles, and with the purest of all possible
intentions, the good of our country; it gives
us the must heartfelt: satisfaction to see that
those principles aud those intentions are pot
confined to ourselves, but that there yet exists
im the Units Senate a Patriot, who dares
speak truth in the cause of his country, and


plead for the people in the face of corruption.

“ Too long has the cause of the people lay
guished ; influence, interest, or prejudice have
precluded knowledge from the senate; or
not precluded, nearly overpowered. The
people have seen with sorrow their happiness
disregarded, and their rights undefended: the
opposition of political warfare has been the
effect of party, and the exertion of ability bsd
interest for its stimulus. .

“ Roused from its torpor, the nation hasat
last begun To THINK FOR ITsELF. Systems!
communication have been formed, and me
diums devised to collect the public voice—
Mediums independent of influence, or comp

ciety, you, Sir, are reise’ to accept the
thanks of an obliged body of men, whith
knows equally how to value its rights, a
esteem the supporters of them. :

We have but to wish that from exertions ©
able, so disinterested as your’s, the cause @
the people may be impartially debated in pr
liament ; and we trust when that is the ay,
the distinction of party will cease, ands par
liamentary reform take place upon the
ground of equal right.

Should our hopes in this respect prove abx-

Mr. Erskine.-—The reading this letter,
which I did not call for, gives me an opportu-
' nity of asking you, whether you would have
' answered that letter in the manner you have
' done, if you had the smallest reason in the
‘ world to belicve that these people were pur-
' suing their object by such means as are charged
! to them here this day?—-My auswer is in
1 general terms of civility, I was not very ambi-

tious of their praise, and did not wish to enter
+ anto any arguinent with them; most assuredly

if I had thought that they had any other
views but to obtain a reform of parliament,
» and that in a proper way by application to
parliament, and by instructions from the
People to their representatives, and such
modes as I conceive the laws of this country
to authorize; if [ had conceived them to have
had any other object, I should not only have
abstained from corresponding with them, but
have considered them as very dangerous
men. I thought them very much mistaken
and absurd upon the point, but I did not enter
into an argument with them.

Mr. Erskine.—-The evidence on the part of
the crown has been divided into two branches
-—first to prove by the language and writings
of those who have been members of different
societies, what their objects were. Secondly,
to see how far the prisoner could be legally in-
volved in these objects. In consequence of
that, many writings and declarations of Skir-
ving and others, who were delegates to the
convention at Edinburgh, have been given in
evidence; what I propose to prove to your
lordships is, that lord Lauderdale, a peer of the
realm, as your lordship knows, had a letter
written to him, requesting him to accept the
office of delegate in the British Convention
for one of the societies comprehended in the
scope of this conspiracy. It would, therefore,
be very unreasonable to suppose that their in-
tention was to destroy the honours of the
nobleman to whom this letter was addressed.
If your lordships think it evidence I will offer
it. Itis dated the 26th of October, just be-
fore the British Convention was held.

The right honourable carl of Laxderdale
. sworn.—Examined by Mr. Erskine.

I wish your lordship to look at that letter
[showing it to his lordship]; did you receive
1t2—--I received it just at the time it bears
date.

Did your lordship know at that time that
the British Convention, as it was called, was
about to be assembled?-~I certainly did.

I understand your lordship declined being
a delegate?---I did; it was an application
from a society of the Friends of the People in
Portsburgh, part of the suburbs of Edinburgh.

Was your lordship at that time in Scotland?
——I had just arrived at Edinburgh.

Were you informed at that time that the
different socicties in England, and also the dif-
Jerent societies in Scotland, were sending
delegates to this society Yes, I was,


Did you give any answer to that letter?
Yes; I wrote an answer.

I cannot ask whit the answer was.---Did
you see the persons who brought the letter ?—-
No, I never did; I saw the secretary, Mr.
Skirving, autecedently to having received this
letter, aud I rather suspect that the offer was
made to me in consequence of the conversa-
tion which passed between him and me. Mr.
Skirving then wrote to Mr. Stuart, requesting
the Society of the Friends of the People to ap-
point a delegate to the British Convention,
I believe Mr. Stuart’s answer, which has been
since printed was, that the society not meet-
ing at that time, it was impossible that they
could appoint a delegate, but he dare say that
any thing I should do would afterwards be ap-
proved by the society; an answer I thought
rather extraordinary. Mr. Skirving called
upon me several times, and pressed me to
take up this idea of Mr. Stuart’s; I objected-—
he pressed it upon this ground, that if men of
education would come amongst them, it might
prevent them from falling into absurdities,
which otherwise their keeuness and cagerness
might lead them to. I declined still to attend
upon the ground that Mr. Stuart had pro-
posed ; I suspected he had got them to make
this representation to me. This letter was
written from a Mr. Moffatt, whom I have
since known, because he acted as private
agent for Mr. Muir and Mr. Fulmer.

Is he a man of character?—I then knew
nothing of him ;-~I have scen a great deal of
him since that period, and [ never knewa
more humane map, nor, I believe, a better
man.

From any thing you saw at the time these
applications were made, had you any reason
to believe or suspect that the members of this
convention were callcd together to assume
the power of government?-—The language
was quite the reverse among themselves, that
their plan was universal suffrage aud annual
parliaments, .

Was there any thing that led you to believe
that that was to be accomplished by force and
violence, overpowering and overturning the
different branches of our government?---Cer-
tainly nothing of the sort. ;

I put it in the most unqualified way?--O
certainly not.

The right honourable the earl of Lauderdale
cross-examined by Mr. Alturncy General.

Your lordship had not heard of a letter that
Skirving had written to Hardy in July, 1793,
that has been read in evidence ?--- At that tine
T had not.

Nor any of those other letters ?--No.

Mr. Erskine.—--Will you give me leave to
ask my lord Lauderdale what change of opi-
nion these letters have made upon him?

Mr. Attorney General—That is for the

jury.
3 Mr. Erskine.-It is for the jury both ways,
because your question infers, that if his lord-

ship had seen these letters, his opinion would

have been the other way.

Mr. Erskine.—My lords, I have now closed
the defence of Mr. Hardy.

Mr. Attorney General.—Before Mr. Gibbs
goes on with the defence, there is a letter
rom Ashton, of the 26tb of May, 1792, which

I wish to have read; it was meant to be

read, but was forgotten; it is by mistake
dated 1797.

“ Sheffield Society for Constitutional In-
Jormation,

“Mr. Adams ;—Sir; Your favour of Srd
ult. came duly to hand, the acceptance of our
twelve friends as members of your's, is highly
Satisfactory to this society, and I am directed
by them ‘to request you will be pleased to
present their sincere thanks to your society
‘or their affectionate regard for, and honour
couterred upon the members of this institu-

ion.

“Tt is with pleasure we congratulate you
on the rapid progress of real and useful know-
ledge, and the dissipation of ignorance and
error from among the general inass of the
people. Knowledge once obtained cannot be
obliterated, but by the loss, orabuse of reason:
truth once fairly discovered and substantiated
cannot be defaced by the sophistry and wicked
designs of artful and: crafty men.

“We are happy to inform you that the
number of our associating, or ticket, mem-
bers, keep increasing, are now about 2,400,
but they have not increased of late in propor-
tion with our worthy and respectable Trends,
who (altho’ they do not associate with us as
an incorporate body) have manifested them-
selves in a way of respectability, adding
strength and support to the undertakings of
this society, and to the cause in general.

“ On Saturday last, 19th inst. we received a
packet of printed addresses, resolves, &c.
from the society (Freemasons tavern) which,
on mature consideration, we find ourselves
not so well reconciled to the ideas they convey
to us as we could wish, if they had appeared
in a different point of view, nor do they afford

us such a flattering prospect as we were appre-


att 4

hensive might be expected from an association
of so respectable a body, under the high deno-
mination of the Friends of the People. In
our opinion, their answer of 12th inst. &
your ictter of 27th ult. is no ways compatible
with that appellation; from the known respee-
tability of many names which appear amonest
them, we had entertained great hopes of their
teal use in obtaining a thorough reform pon
the principles of the Rights of Man, which
can never be accomplished, until every mas
enjoys his lawful and just privileges.

“ Previous to the reception of this packet,
we did communicate to them, by letter, the

leasing hopes it reflected to us, 00 lookieg
jorward, viewing such respectable characters
signalizing themselves in support of the
people’s rights, agreeable to the above pra
ciples, and the denomination by which they
have entitled themselves, &c. In due course
they would receive our letter last Thursday
se’nnight, and in consequence we apprehend
the packet was forwarded to us on the same
day, but without any written communicatios:
we shall not attempt any farther communica
tion with them, until we are favoured with
your sentiments upon the subject, or uott
matters of doubt which we at present entertam,
be, removed.

“We also received a packet from the
Friends of the People, Southwark, and they
have our hearty concurrence and best wishes;
we shall in a day or two forward our reply to
them.

“We have also becn favoured with a
affectionate communication from our friends
and fellow labourers at Manchester, and from
several other places, who are about to form
themselves into societies; Birmingham im
particular claims all the assistance trom est
blished societies which possibly can be admi-
nistered, there are great numbers in that place
friendly to the cause of the people, and we
hope (notwithstanding the late tragical wracs-
actions) if prudent methods are adopted and
pursued, the people’s attention may be turned
to their own interest, and the mouths of dev
pots and ranting bigots stopped, which is, and
must be the sincere wish of every real friend
to the peace and welfare of mankind. Iam

Mr. Gibbs.—May it please your Lordships;

—Gentlemen of the jary;® I need not state tu




t you the anxiety that I must necessarily feel | treason; and you are bound to inquire of

| upon this occasion, oppressed by the weight | nothing that is not there charged.

| ofa cause under which the mighty abilities of
| my learned friend could hardly support him.
1 But, gentlemen, if Ican, I will do my duty to
+ that miserable man at the bars if my strength
1! enables me to go through the defence which
1 I bave undertaken, I will defend him; it is
1 not a wish to spare my own strength, it is not
| @ wish to spare my own health which has
| overpowered me, but it is because I have felt
» this cause too great for me; I have felt myself
, incapable of comprehending, in my mind, the
» vast mass of evidence which the crown has
; produced against this man. No time which
) the indulgence of the Court has allowed me,
1 Do industry of my own (in which, I assure
, you, I have not failed) has enabled me so to
, conceive, in my mind, this vast cause, as to
_ State it intelligibly to you; for so, and so only
, does the interest of the prisoner, and public
. Justice, require that it should be stated.
Gentlemen, you will remember that, in the
, outset, it took the attorney-gencral nine hours
. Merely to open this case; a length of speech
, unheard of; the annals of this kingdom do
, Rot afford an instance of a prosecution founded
en so many complicated facts, drawn out of
such a tangled web, that less than a speech of
_ nine hours could not render it intelligible to
the jury, nor explain to them by what mode
of reasoning it was meant to bring the imputed
charge home to the prisoner.

To suppose that the attorney-general has
stated his case at greater length, or burthened
it with more evidence than in his judgment
was necessary, would be casting an unworthy
reflection on him. His known character
renders it impossible. ‘The prosecution itself
must be thought to have required for its sup-
port this mass of evidence, which it is our
duty, as counsel for the prisoner, to observe
upon, but impossible, in the time allowed us,
to understand. ‘This it is that weighs us down.
—Remember the situation in which my
jearned friend, Mr. Erskine was; you saw
how even he was oppressed by it; it was not
possible for human ability, and I feel it so,
because it was not possible for his standing
up to repel a charge drawn by such subtle
reasoning, out of such a complication of facts ;
it was not possible for the ability of man so to
coraprehend and embrace, in his mind, those
facts, as to enable him to lay before you a fair
defence for the prisoner.

Gentlemen, in order to make what I have
to address to you upon this subject intelligible,
it is necessary that I should first state to you
what I conceive the law of the subject to be,
and what questions that law submits to your
consideration in the present case. This is to
be looked for—First, m the indictment; next,
in the statute upon Which the indictment is
founded. 1 say it is to be looked for in the
indictment, because it is necessary that the
indictment should charge the prisoner with
some fact or.facts, which, in law, amount to

The charge against the prisoner is, that he
has compassed the king’s death, and that, for

the purpose of carrying that design, entertained

against the king’s life, into execution, he has

done certain acts stated in the indictment.

The treason charged is, that he compassed

the king’s death; the means by which he is

stated to have endeavoured to effect this pur-

pose, are,

First, “That he, with others, met, and
conspired to. procure a convention and meet-
ing, with intent, and in order that the persons
to be assembled at such convention and
Meeting, should and might, wickedly and
traitorously, without, and in defiance of the
authority, and against the will of the parlia-
ment of this kingdom, subvert and alter, and
cause to be subverted and altered, the legisla-
ture, rule, and government, now duly and
happily established in this kingdom, and de-
pose, and cause to be deposed, our said lord
the king.”—That is the first overt act stated in .
the indictment; it is not necessary for me to
state the other overt acts relative to the con-
vention, because in reality their tendency is
the same; it only states the different means
they touk in order to procure that convention,
the ultimate end of which the charge states,
was to accomplish the king's death. There
are other acts charged, stating, that the defen-
dant conspired “ to levy war against the king,
for the purpose of deposing him.” Another
charge is, that “they did mect, conspire,
consult and agree among themselves, and
with divers other false traitors, whose names
are to the said jurors unknown, to raise, levy,
and make insurrection, rebellion, and war
within this kingdom, against our said lord the
king.” So that you see the charges, stated in
the indictment, against the prisoner, are these
—The first is an act of his mind, that he
compassed the death of the king. The next
is, that, in order to carry into execution that
design, to destroy the king, he did certain
acts, stated in the indictment, which acts are
alleged to have an immediate view of depos-
ing the king; and from that immediate view
of deposing the king, you are desired to infer,
that the ultimate object was to accomplish
the king’s death.

This indictment is founded upon the statute
of Edward the third, upon which my learned
friend argued very ably and elaborately. You
observe that, before this statute, different opi-
nions had been entertained as to what was,
and what was not treason; and men had
been drawn into the penalties of treason,
without suspecting that they had incur
them. .

The statute recites, ‘ that divers opinions
had been entertained in what case treasqn
shall be said, and in what not; and therefore
the king, at the request of the Lurds, and of
the Commons, makes a declaration of what
shall be treason; that is to say, when a man

doth compass or imagine the death of our
lord the king, or our lady his queen, or of
their eldest son and heir, and thereof be
provably attainted of open deed by the people

at

of their condition, it is to be understood t

in that case it ought to be judged treason,”

that is, high treason.

Then the statute goes on with a declaration
that nothing but that, which is precisely ex-
pressed and specified in the statute, shall be
treason :—“ And because that many other
like cases of treason may happen in time to
come, which a man cannot think nor declare
at this present time, it is accorded, that if any
other case, supposed treason, which is not
above specified, doth happen before any
justices, the justices shall tarry, without any
going to judgment of the treason, till the
cause be shuwed and declared before the king
and his parliament, whether it ought to be

judged treason or other felony.”

You have then the indictment stating these
points, which yuu are to consider, whether !
the prisoner compassed the king’s death, and !
whether he committed these acts with an
intent immediately to depose the king, ie

ne
main charge is, that he compassed the king’s
death. ‘Ihis is the only treason, presented by
the indictment, to your inquiry; and this isthe

ila have been legally

stated in the indictment, since the statute of
the 25th of Edward Srd; if this indictment had |
varied from the statute in charging any thing
dues not make

so, it would be erroneous: if former indict-
ments, from the time of passing the statute
to the present, had varied from it, without
being noticed, that would not alter the law

ultimately to accomplish his death.

only form in which it cou

as treason which the statute

upon the subject, because in cases arisin;
upon a statute, no established form of legal

proceedings can control the statute, but must

e corrected by it.

In this case, however, the form of the in-
dictment and the statute go hand in hand;
it appears frum each that nothing shall be
treason (nothing, at least, necessary to be
considered upon the present occasion), except
the compassing the king’s death. You will
observe the statute says likewise, that the
party must be “ provably attainted of open
deed by the people of his condition.” Now,
upon this statute, lord Coke, who was one of
the most learned lawycrs that has ever lived,
has commented, and I shall take the liberty
shortly of stating his comment, at least that

- particular part of it, because that will point
out to you how careful the law is, and how
careful all writers upon the law are, to guard
judges and juries against ever extending this
statute; it points out the method you ought
to use in investigating the charge brought
against the prisoner, and therefore I trust it
will not be thought useless if I state it to you.

The treason charged is, you see, a compassin
the king’s death; there must be in the min


king’s death, but that must be proved to a
jury by his acts, and on that part of the su
tute in which the legislature says, “ that thr
parly shall be provably attainted of ojeo
deed by the people of their conditiun,” lod
Coke has thus commented. Gentlemen,
where your recollection goes to the argumett
of Mr. Erskine, which passed some time ago.
Tam sure you will regret that I should repat
it, but I will only endeavour to bring bac
those things which may have escaped you.
Lord Coke says, (3 inst. 12.) “ In ths
branch four things are to be observed. Fir,
this word provably, that is, upon direct, m-
nifest proof, not upon conjectural presump
tions, or inferences, or strains of wit, tut
upon good and sufficient proof; and heria
the adverb (provablement) provably hth:
great force, and significth a direct and pho
proof, which word the King, the Lords ai
Commons in parliament did use, for that the
offence was so heinous, and was so hesviy
and so severely punished, as none other tte
like, and therefore the offender must praca
be attainted, which. words are as forcibieas
upon direct and manifest proof. Note, the
word is not probably, for then commune crgv-
mentum might have served, but the word is
procably be attainted.” ;
This you see, gentlemen, is an exhortation
to you who are to find whether the prisuner
or is not guilty; that you do not find bin
guilty, without plain, direct, and manic!
proof—this is the proof which the legislate
requires for the purpose of fixing this noe
upon the prisoner; this is the proof which a
course you, who are the jury to try his quit
innocence, must be satisfied has been zea
in the cause, before you can find him gulls.
Gentlemen, I will trouble you tarther.
merely with a statement of the way in whica
judges who have had to try causes upva ths
statute, have laid down the law to the Juv.
I shall then have stated to you the indictuert
—the statute upon which it is founded, the
construction of one of the most learned ls-
yers who ever lived upon that statute, andtie
acting of one of the most learned judges a
has ever adorned the bench (I speak of
chief justice Pemberton)* when he sat on bt
trial of lord Russell, who was charged with aa
offence of the same sort as that with whi!

alluded to in court, and not from the ba, bet
from the bench. I have heard the sm



rible treason and traitorous compassings,
imaginations, and purposes aforesaid, he, the
‘said William Russell, together with other false
‘traitors, maliciously, traitorously, and advi-
*sedly between themselves, and with divers
other traitors to the jurors unknown, did
meet tovether, consult, agree, and conclude
insurrection and rebellion against our sove-
reign lord the king within this kingdom of
England, to move and stir up, and the guards
fur the preservation of the person of our said
Jord the king to seize and destroy, against the
duty of his allegiance.”*
So you see the charge in that indictment
was, that lord Russell had compassed the
king’s death, and to effect that treason, had
conspired to raise insurrection and rebellion
against the king, and to seize the ds ap-
pointed for the preservation of the king’s per-
son. The evidence given in that case went
certainly to show, if it went to show any thing,
that lord Russell had conspired to raise insur-
rection and rebellion in the kingdom, and to
seize the king’s guards, and yet lord chief
justice Pemberton in summing up (Istate this
to show what is the matter for you to inquire
.into in this case) does not tell the jury that
the point for them to consider is, whether the
prisoner had conspired to raise insurrection
and rebellion against the person of the king ;
and if they found that, they must find the
prisoner guilty; but he tells them this—
“© now the question before you will be, whe-
ther upon this whole matter you do believe”
—not that lord Russell had raised insurrec-
tion and rebellion against the king, but
“ whether you do believe my lord Russell
had any design upon the king’s life, to destroy
the king, or take away his lite ;”"—that is the
charge which my lord chief justice Pember-
ton gives to the jury who tried lord Russell,
and no man ever complained that the trial of
lord Russell was not sufficiently severe—
« that (he says) is the material part here, itis
used and given you by the king’s counsel as
an evidence of this, that he did conspire to
raise an insurrection, and to cause a rising of
the people to make as it were, a rebellion
within the nation, and to surprise the king's
guards, which, say they, can have no other
end but to seize and destroy the king.”
So that lord chief justice Pemberton puts it
to the jury, that though they believed these
facts, yet from these facts they were to col-
lect whether the prisoner had, or had not, a
design upon the king's life, for if he had not,
they could not find him guilty; if that had
not been his opinion of the law upon this
subject, he would not have put it to them to
say whether lord Russell by this means meant
to accomplish the king's death, but would
have put it—do you believe he conspired to
‘raise an insurrection and rebellion against
the person of the king? if you believe that,

i believe enough ; he does not say that—
¢ says they put this to vou as an evidence
that he meant to seize and destroy the kin;
and he goes on to say—* it is a great evi-
dence ?”—but it is only an evidence—(“ if my
lord Russell did design to seize the king’s
gears, and make an insurrection in the king-

om) of a design to surprise the king’s per-
son. It must be left to you upon the whole
matter—you have not evidence in this case,
as there was in the other matter that was
tried in the morning, or yesterday, against
the conspirators to kill the king at the
Rye.”

Gentlemen, I should tell you that either on
that same morning, or the day before, some
other prisoners had been tried for being accom-
plices in the Rye-house plot, and a part of
that plot was not only to raise an insurrection
against the king, but to seize his person, and
murder him; therefore lord chief justice
Pemberton says—“ you have not evidence in
this case, as there was in the other matter
that was tried in the morning: or yesterday,
against the conspirators to kill the king at the
Rye. There was a direct evidence of a con-
sult to kill the king; that is not given you
in this case; this 1s an act of contriving a
rebellion, and an insurrection within the
kingdom, to seize his guards, which is urged
as an evidence, and surely is in itself an evi-
dence to seize and destroy the king.” So that
lord chief justice Pemberton puts it to the
jury that these facts are strong evidence of
that which they are to inquire into, namely,
a compassing the king’s death, but he puts it
to them as the evidence, and distinguishes the
case from the cases in the morning, where the
design was, to seize and destroy the king.
Where is the need of that distinction, if con-
\ spiring to raise rebellion agains the king be,

as is now contended by the counsel for the
crown, conclusively and directly treason in
itself? He goes on to say, “ upon this whole
matter this is left to you; if you believe the
prisoner at the bar to have conspired the death
of the king, and in order to that to have had
those consults that those witnesses speak of,
then you must find him guilty of this treason
that is laid to his charge,”*—that is, if you
find that he conspired the death of the king ;
but unless you draw that conclusion from the
other evidence in the cause, you cannot find
him guilty; this is lord chief justice Pember-
ton’s summing up to the jury; and yet he is
complained of by the friends of lord Russell,
as having dealt too hardly with him ; there-
fore I think it cannot be imputed to him that
he did this in any favour to the prisoner—he
states the point for the jury to be, whether
they think that the prisuner conspired to put
the king to death. J admit that under many
circumstances, a jury ought to draw that con-


clusion, but it is always a question whether
they will draw that conclusion, or not. I
think upon much consideration of the ques-
tion, not only that the existence of the
overt-act is for the jury, but that it is also
for them to find whether the overt-act
was committed in the prosecution of that
design upon the king’s life, which must be
stated in the indictment; not only does this
appear to be the opinion of lord chief justice
Pemberton, but of sir George Treby, who was
then recorder of London, and who afterwards
was lord chief justice of the Common Pleas.
Lord Russell was found guilty—the jury did
find from the facts laid before them, from his
conspiring to raise an insurrection against the

erson ef the king, and more than that from

is design to scize those very guards that are
appointed for the protection of the king’s

erson, that he did conspire the death of the

ing, and I cannot say it was an unreasonable
conclusion. You shall hear whether this is
an inaccurate expression of lord chief justice
Pemberton’s, or whether it was generally con-
sidered then as the law. Lord Russell after-
wards, when he was brought up for judg-
ment,® desires to have the indictment read to
him, When he hears the charge against him
of compassing and conspiring the king’s death
he starts—he says, “ hold, I thought I had
not been charged in the indictment of com-
passing and conspiring the death of the king.”
The attorney-general says, “ yes, my lord,
you are.” Then he says to the recorder—
‘T appeal to you and the Court, even if all the
witnesses have sworn.be true, whether I am
guilty within the statute of Edward 3d, there

aving been an evidence of a conspiracy to
levy war, but no evidence of an intention to
kill the king; and therefore I think truly
jndgment ought not to pass upon me for con-
spiring the death of the king, of which there
was no proof by any one witness.” That is
only lord Russell’s argument—how is he
answered by sir George Treby ? he does not
say, what you state to have been sworn to

by some of the witnesses is treason, but he |

says— that was an exception proper (and as
I think you did make it) before the verdict,
whether the evidence does amount to prove
the charge; that is proper to be observed to
the jury ;’—Sir George Treby then agrees
with the chief justice, that it was for the jury
to determine whether the evidence of con-

spiring to raise an insurrection and rebellion |

in the kingdom, and to seize the king's guard,
does or does not prove a compassing of the
king’s death; he admits that it is not treason
in law, but it may be evidence of compassing
the king's death, if the jury think proper to
drawthat conclusion. He goes on—* for if
the evidence comes short of the indictment,
they cannot find it to bea true charge, but


dict as well as your lordship. We are tor:
by what the jury have found, not by the ei-
dence that was laid before them.”

So, you see, itis plain, in this case fror
the direction given by lord chief justice Pea-
berton, in summing up; and from the tex
pitulation of that summing up, if I may soa!
It, by sir George Treby, when lord Ruse:
was brought up for judgment, that the po:
for the jury is, whether the overt act, lad &
the subsequent part of the indictment, prove
the treason laid in the furmer part of their
dictment, namely, the compassing the king:
death. I never will stand up to contend t:
there are not many acts of this sort stated in
' my lord Russeil’s case, from which an hoes!
| jury ought always to find that the pris
| did compass the king’s death. I think thee
| was in that case, supposing the fact tok
: proved that he meant to raise insurrection ad
rebellion in the state inst the king. ax
| that he meant to seize t ards of the king,
I think that was strong evidence to go to
jury, that his attempt aimed at the kgs
life, and I cannot blame thesa fer finding t
verdict that they did; yet still it was wb
them. .

Gentlemen, having stated what I comer
to be the law upon this subject, and ans
| from that what the points are for your con
deration, I will state to you now the cha
which has been attempted in evidence, 10
brought against the prisoner ; 1 have stated
it before, but in order to render myself inte
ligible, I will shortly repeat it—it is, “ tha
he conspired to procure a convention,” wld
convention, when met, was to overtum tte
government, to depose the king, and to pal
him to death. To a certain point we st
agreed—we agree that he did hold consult
j tions for the purpose of calling a conve
tion—the point upon which we differ is
| purpose for which that convention was tobe
called ; and it is for my learned friends lo
are of counsel for the crown, before they a#
| bring this charge home upon the prisoner #
prove one or other of these two things, elie
| that a convention cannot be called for wy
other but treasonable purposes, or to prt.
in fact, that this convention was called &
the purpose of procuring the deposition of Ue
| king, and thereby his death : they must pro
‘ one or other of these two things. Now tr
| first it is impossible to prove—to assert thats
convention, or meeting of delegates from dt
' ferent sets of people, cannot be called ~
| ther but for treasonable purposes, would
absurd, and ne such thing can pass from tt
mouth of either of my friends. You ae

showing that conventions may be called for
lawful purposes.

Then the next thing to be considered is,
whether the attorney-general has proved that
this convention was called for that specific un-
lawful purpose which he has stated, namely,
to depose the king (for that is the gist of the
cause) and thereby to compass his death—
they undertake to prove this; we, on the
other hand, say, that the convention was
meant to be called for lawful purposes ;—we
say that the prisoner at the bar, and those
with whom he acted, believed that corruption
had found its way into the state, and was
making large strides in it; that he believed
this corruption was occasioned, encreased,
and continued by the long duration of parlia-
ments, and by the unequal representation of
the people in the House of Commons; that if
these defects could be reformed, all would be
well ; he knew, and they knew, thata petition
to parliament would not produce the end
which they wished to procure, because matty
of their petitions had been, I may almost say
contumeliously, rejected ; they thought, there-
fore, that it lay upon them, as g citizens,
to find some other means by which they
might effect what they conceived to bea law-
ful purpose; and they believed that if the
general opinion of the people was for this re-

‘orm, and if that general opinion could be
made known to parliament, that parliament,
though it had rejected the separate petitions
of individuals, would yet attend to the general
opinion properly conveyed to them; they saw
no other way of conveying this opinion to
parliament, but by calling together a conven-
tion of delegates sent from different parts of
the country, by the voice of which delegates
they might first collect whether this was, or
was not, the general wish of the people, and
if it was so, that they might by the same
voice communicate this general wish to par-
liament. This they professed, and there can
be no doubt that this the language of their
resolutions imports.

On the other hand, the gentlemen who are
of counsel for the crown say that all this was
mere pretext—you did not think that there
was corruption in the state; you did not
think that that corruption arose from the un-
equal representation of the people in the
House of Commons, and the long duration of
parliament; you did not think that this re-
form, which you speak of, would produce a
remedy—you had other views, and we take
upon ourselves to prove that you had them.
Certainly it does lie upon them to prove these
other purposes ; and as the language of our
resolutions imports that our intentions were
innocent, unless they can show from positive
and direct proof, from that plain, direct, and
manifest evidence which lord Coke says is
necessary in all cases of treason, that the pri-
soner, and those with whom he was concerned,
did endeavour to bring about a revolution in


by means of this convention, it is impossible
that you can find him guilty of the charge
that is now brought against him.

_ Gentlemen, there are two parts of the propo-
sition which, in point of fact, the counsel for
the crown feel it necessary to make out. In
the first place, they say we will prove there
was a general plot in the kingdom for effect-
ing this purpose, that is for effecting the de-
position of the king. In the next place, we
will prove that the prisoner, with others, was
an actor in this plot, and is implicated in the
crime in which they are all implicated. Now
you will recollect that for the sake of making
out that first part of their proposition, which
brings no guilt to the mind of the prisoner—
which shows no intention of his to bring about
that which is imputed to the others ; they have
not only called many members of all these
societies, but have proved every thing that
ever was done or declared by any member
either of the Constitutional Society, the Cor-
responding Society, or any members of any .
other society that ever corresponded with
either of these societies ; that they say is for
the purpore of proving the general plot. This
would not be evidence as against the prisoner
individually, but this it is necessary for them
to go through, in order to make out the first
part of their proposition, that there did really
exist a general plot in the kingdom, for the
purpose of deposing the king, and afterwards
they endeavour to show you that the prisoner
was concerned in that plot; this you see does
not touch the prisoner, without proot thathe was
concerned in what they call the general plot.

Now, gentlemen, this certainly does lay us
under considerable hardships. I told you be-
fore, and I am sure you will afterwards hear
from his lordship that nothing of this species
of evidence, which is not brought home per-
sonally to the prisoner, ought to affect him
personally; that it goes only to prove the
existence of a plot, and yet how difficult is it
for us who stand as counsel for the prisoner ;
how difficult for you who are the arbiters of
his fate; how difficult for the Court, who yet
will do it better than either of us can, to dis-
tingnish the separate parts of this evidence, to
say what tends only to prove the general plot,
and what to affect the prisoner personally !

The difficulty upon us is insuperable, not
from the nature of the thing, but from the
extentof the evidence into which we were
carried ; for I declare that, with all the dili-
gence which I have been able to use, and
with all the time which the indulgence of the
Court has granted me, I feel it utterly impos-
sible, in my own mind, to separate them, and,
therefore, it is impossible for me to state
where the line of distinction lies. If my
learned friends, who conducted the prosecu-
tion, had first finished their gencral evidence,
and had then gone to that which was to
bring it home to the prisoner, we might to 3
certain degree have been able to distinguish

the state, and hurl the king from his throne | it, but as the case is they have jumbled alt


4C

and opinion of many people wiser than he (I
would not have used these expressions if the
noble duke had not left the courty—it does, I
say, appear to me folly, but then when these
opinions are thus promulgated, that which is
folly may reasonably be supposed to find its
way into the mind of a shoe-maker.

Another topic which was urged upon the
prisoner strongly, in the opening, was, that
French terms were continually used in the re-
solutions; and therefore it was supposed that
Mr. Hardy and those with whom he acted,
wished to introduce into this country, all that
anarchy which had been produced in France,
by those who use the same terms.—I_ leave
you to judge how material that observation is
against the prisoner, when I state to you,
that we, meaning to have proved the origin of
one of these terms, in order to show tit
was not derived from the French, were told
that the evidence was inadmissible; that it
signified nothing to the cause, whether it was
derived from the French, or the Scots, because
it was no part of your business to collect,
from words, whether the prisoner is guilty, o
not, of a fact charged upon him; theretore
you may dismiss from your minds all obser-
vation upon the use of terms, when we were
ready to prove, that a term they call a French
one is an English one.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—If you meanany
thing that fell from the Court to that effect,
rather think you misunderstood the Court.

Mr. Gibbs—My argument upon _ that
subject was couched in a word ;—I said, we
offer this evidence to show that a convention
kid held in Scotland, before the time we held

is.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre. —There was no-
thing said of those terms that I am aware of.

Mr. Gibbs—No; that is my reasoning upoe
the subject.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Nor was it
stated that these terms were used in that
convention.

Mr. Gibbs.—We meant to show, that the
term “ Convention,” which they insist to be
of French origin, is not so. Gentlemen, I
submit to you, that my argument upon this
subject is a fair one, and a conclusive one;
either the use of French terms is or is not
material in this case, and is, or is not to be
argued upon.—If it is to be argued in this
case, that we approved of French principles,
because we have used French terms, then I
insist, that it is competent to me to show,
that a term which we have used, and which
they have said to be French, is English, or is
Scotch, because thereby I get rid of the pre
sure of that term,—If on the other hand, it be
not open to me to show, that terms which are
used by the prisoner, and those with whom
he acted, and that are said to be French, are
English or are Scotch, then I am sure it cannot
be open to gentlemen, on the other side, to
contend, that we are to be supposed, by the use
of French terms, to have adopted French idess,

together, sometimes a fee of evidenee is
offered to the general plot, then something
that affects the prisoner succeeds it; some-
times a man from Sheffield, sometimes a man
from one society, sometimes from another,
sometimes a letter produced from one of the
societies, sometimes from another, and some-
times from a third. I findit utterly impossible,
in my own mind, so to separate them as to
lay before, you any plain line of distinction
which you could safely pursue. I must con-
tent myself, therefore, with stating generall
what appears to me the tendency of the evi-
dence by which they have endeavoured to
show that there existed this general plot, and
also that the prisoner was concerned in it.
In the firstplace numberless papers havebeen
roduced to you, in which you find very vio-
ent and very improper expressions and reso-
lutions. I admit that they are highly repre-
hensible; it is not for me to say whether they
are, or are not criminal, because it is not my
duty at present to contend whether they fall
under any crime but that of high treason ; but
it is the duty of my learned friends to point
out that any of these resolutions, picked from
the monstrous chaos of papers, that they
have produced on this occasion, amount to an
act of high treason. The point you have to
try in this case, is whether they amount to an
act which had for its object to depose the
King, and thereby to destroy him. That the
expressions are improper, neither my learned
friend nor I ever would deny; certainly they
are highly so—no man of sense—no man of
reason—no man of decency would stand up to
defend all these resolutions, or to defend ex-
pressions that are to be found in many of the
papers, but they are not high treason, and
that is the question that you have to try;
they may show an indecent and irritated dis-
position in the minds of those who wrote
them; but they do not bring home to the
prisoner that guilt of which he is now ac-
cused, that of conspiring with others to sub-
vert the state and depose the king, and there-
by to effect his death.

If we are to consider these papers, let us
take them all; let that which makes for the
prisoner be taken, as well as that which
Makes against him; the counsel for the
crown say that the prisoner had no intention
to bring about annual parliaments and uni-
versal suffrage, that it is alla pretence.

Gentlemen, look at the papers which will
be summed up by my lord, when the solicitor
general has gone through his reply, and you
will find them full of these declarations ; you
will find the complaint is of the corruption of
the present House of Commons; you will
find that the cause of that complaint is always
stated to be the partial representation of the
people in that House ; you will find that the
objects sought by the prisoner, and those with
whom he acted, were annual parliaments and
universal suffrage, folly I think, and I dare
sey you think so,—but yet it is the expression

 a i a ad


because the effect of these two decisions
would be this, that the counsel for the prose-
cution may argue against the prisoner, from
certain facts, which the prisoner, though he
knows them to be false, shall not be per-
mitted to controvert. This cannot, surely be
supported, and therefore all arguments aris-
ing from the use of French terms, must, as it
appears to me be excluded from the cause.
Another thing imputed to us is, that we
approve the French Revolution.—Certainly
the prisoner at the bar, and certainly many

* of those with whom he acted, did highly ap-

rome

- a a a re

ove of the French Revolution ;—it was
ikely that they should approve of the French
Revolution, in its origin, because they were

j Englishmen, and because they were Freemen,
an

because the original object of that revo-
lution was, to give to Slaves the freedom which
we enjoy here. What was more likely tocatch
the ear, to catch the mind of an Englishman
than that a nation, which had certainly
been in a state of abject slavery for centurics
past, was restored to that freedom to which
they were entitled by nature? I know it will
be urged against me, that, after that period
was past (I speak of the origin of the French
Revolution), after acts of enormity, of which
no rational man can approve, had taken place
in France, that they still approve generally of
the French Revolution; but it was not these
acts, but the revolution in general, to which
their approbation went; and supposing that,
under all the then existing circumstances in
France, they had expressed a general appro-
bation of the French Revolution, and the
state of things, as they then existed in France,
is it to be inferred from thence, that they
wished the same thing to take place in Eng-
land? Did the same necessity lie upon us as
upon France? Were we an afflicted and
oppressed people? Had we any reason to
complain of an over-bearing Nobility, whose
hts were inconsistent with the general
rly of the people? Had we any reason to
complain of the oppressions of the Crown or
of the Royal family? Do you find, from the
beginning to the end of the evidence, a single
complaint of that sort?

You find, in many instances, they speak of
the king, and the herelitars nobility of this
country, as entitled to reverence and respect.
—Was it so in France? Were the king and
nobility of that country entitled to the rever-
ence and respect of the subjects of France, as
the king and nobility of this country are en-
titled to the reverence and respect of the peo-
ple here?—No;—far otherwise; it is not
therefore to be supposed, that, because these
men approved of the revolution in France,
they approved of the late acts of violence that
have been committed upon the persons of
severalof the nobility of that country: It is
not to be presumed against the prisoner, that
he means to overturn the government of this
country and to bring about the destruction of
the king, because, forsooth, perhaps, with

ri
ii


a misunderstanding of the subject, he ha’
pa cag an approbation of the French Re-
volution even at a time when a more reason-
able man would not have done it.

But more than that, wishes of union with
France had been expressed.— Why, gentlemen,
what man is there, who, if it could be accom-
plished with safety to this country, would not
wish for an union with France, rather than
such a war as the present? This was their
object, as it will appear when you hear the
evidence summed up by his lordship, from
what I remember of a letter, which contains
some resolutions addressed from one societ
to another—I believe the resolution for ad-
dressing the National Convention of France ;
—the motive which actuated them is stated
there to be, to prevent the calamities of war,
Surely, gentlemen, we have seen enough of
this war to conclude, that, if these calamities
could have been prevented, it would have been
wisdom to have prevented them. The prisoner
may have judged ill upon that occasion ; those
with whom he acted may have judged ill;
the war may have been a just and necessary
one; I have nothing to do with that; but
still you must allow, that a contrary opinion
might have been entertained; and if experi-
ence has shown that the war was calamitous,
and there were circumstances existing, at
that time, from which it might peasibly be
foreseen, that it would be calamitous; if an
opinion could possibly be entertained, from
the then existing facts, that we might have
kept out of the war, surely you will not say,
that the prisoner is guilty of high treason
for expressing a wish, that an union might
take place with France, when he declares,
that his reason for entertaining that wish was,
that a war which has turned out to be calami-
tous, might be avoided.

The remarks which have been made on the
Address to the National Convention are open
to the same answer.

Then the insertion of Roland and Barrere’s
speeches is attempted to be fixed upon Mr.
Hardy ; and mark how wide he stands from
it; there is a resolution, at a meeting of the
society, that certain speeches in the French
language, from a French newspaper, should
be inserted in their books, and they never are
inserted.

Do you think, that that shoemaker under-
stands French? Do you think, that that shoe-
maker ever read the Moniteur? Can you
believe that, at the time when that passed,
he could have any idea of what were
the contents of these speeches? — Not
that I admit, by any means, that, if the
fact were proved upon him; if he were the
person who made that motion, that it proves
any thing in this cause. What does it
amount to? That he wished to have commu-
nicated to the members of this society, what
the reasons were upon which those who were
desirous of bringing about that calamitous
event in France, acted; if he thought those

reasons were convincing; if he thought they
ought to be followed up by an execution of
the design; though I should differ from him
most unquestionably, yet I am far from
thinking and i am sure you will be far from
* thinking, that it is to be inferred from thence,
that he compassed the death of his own king.
What has the state of France to do with Eng-
land? What were the grounds of accusation
against the king of France? A constitution
had been received in the country, of which
the king was a part; the accusation against
the king was, that he had violated that con-
stitution ;—perhaps he was in the same
situation there, in which James the second
was here.

I do not say that the prisoner might not be
misguided; I do not say that those by whom
he was advised, or with whom he acted, might
Not have misled him ; but even if he had read
the speeches himself, if he had himself entered
the resolutions on the book in English, 1 do
insist that it does not furnish a presumption
that he compassed the death of the king of
England. The circumstances of that nation
and this are widely different—Thank God !
the king of England lives in the hearts of his
subjects; there is nv accusation against him
that he has violated the constitution of this
country; he has by his public and private
virtues deserved and acquived the affections
of his subjects ;—so I think, so you all think,
and so the prisoner thinks. And it would be
Monstrous cruelty to impute to him a design
against the life of the king of England, he-
cause, under certain circumstances, he wished
to have published to a society of people, the
reasons upon which certain persons in France
thought it right to bring their king to a cala-
mitous end.

Itis said, that the prisoner, and those with
whom he acted, must have intended by as-
sembling this convention to act with force
against the government, because, forsooth,
they had resolved that they would no longer
Petition parliament. Now, it seems to me,
that that resolution naturally preceded the
calling together such a convention as I have
stated the prisoncr intended to call, and as I
insist he might legally call. If the petitions
of individuals had obtained from parliament
that which it was their object to obtain by
calling this convention, then the calling the
convention would be unnecessary; but it was
because the petitions of separate individuals
had been rejected, and because the prisoner,
and those with whom he acted, thought that
the voice of the people might be raised louder
than by petitions of individuals, and that then
it would be heard : it was for that reason that
he meant to call this convention ; the object
of the convention was, to petition parliament
in a different form, and in a voice that was
more likely to be heard by them, in a voice
which, he supposed, would be that of the
Majority of the people of England.

entlemen, you heard read to you that


which I shall have occasion to state more at
large hereafter: the protest of that great coo
stitutional lawyer, lord Camden, together
with thirty-two other peers, against the nega
tive put upon a motion for a committee to
quire into the expenditure of the pubic
money.—From thencethey might have learned
that there is a great difference between a pe-
tition from separate individuals and the voice
of the people speaking in associations ; and you
will learn from thence likewise, that, in the
opinion of lord Camden, such associations
were legal; mark the words of this protest;
—“And, however some may affect to be
alarmed as if such associations tended to dis
turb the peace, or encroach upon the dele
gated power of the other House; we are per-
iaded it has no other view but to collect we
sense of the people, and to inform the whok
body of the representatives what are the sen
timents of the whole body of their constitucnts,
in which respect their proceedings have been
orderly, peaceable, and constitutional ; and ifit
be asked, what farther is to be done if these pe-
titions are rejected? the best answer is, thattbe
case cannot be supposed; for, although, upon
a few separate petitions it may be fuirly said,
that the other House ought not to be decided
by a part only of their constituents, yet it
cannot be presumed they will act in defiance
of the united wishes of the whole people,
or indeed of any great and notorious majority.”

Why then, gentlemen, alter private petr
tions have been received and rejected, It &
lawful for the people to associate tor ep
pose of obtaining that which parliament alone
can give to them; and such associations are,
(I am using the language of lord Camden, as
great a constitutional lawyer as ever lived)
such associations are legal and constitutional;
and this is a legal and constitutional method
of collecting the voice of the people, and of
carrying it to the ear of parliament.

The next general topic of argument that
was insisted upon by the attorney-general,
and the head of evidence that he went into
was, I think, the proceedings of Mr. Hardy,
and those with whom he was concerned 0
the Scotch Convention. He began with the
instructions that were given to the delegates,
whom they sent to that convention, and tbe
article which he relies on as showing that the
prisoner is guilty of the charge brought
against him, was the seventh, in which it is
stated “ That it is the duty of the people to
resist any act of parliament repugnant to the
original principles of the constitution, as
would be every attempt to prohibit associa
tions for the purpose of reform.”

T certainly disagree with him in tbat; I
certainly think that that was an improper re-
solution, but it is not an act of high treasoa;

suppose @ particular act of parliament, o>
noxious to the public, is resisted ; suppose men
tise in bodies to resist it; suppose they mise
an insurrection in the country to resist it;
that is high treason ; but conspiriag to rise

an insurrection for the purpose of resisting

such an actis not high treason.—So the law
© is expressly stated by lord chief justice Holt
+ in sir John Freind’s case, his words are “ If
> persons do assemble themselves and act with

force in opposition to some law which they
: think inconvenient, and hope thereby to get it
‘ repealed, this is levying a war and treason,
- though purposing and designing it is not so,
*So when they endeavour in great numbers
: with force to make some reformation of their
- own heads, without pursuing the methods of

the law, that is a levying war and treason, but
» the purposing and designing st is not so.”*

Why then, gentlemen, if conspiring to raise

an insurrection against an existing law, and to
‘ resist the operation and execution of that law,
be not high treason, a fortiori, a resolution, to
. Oppose, if it shall be passed, a law which at
present has no existence, cannot be high
: treason.
«The prisoner, Mr. Hardy, is a member of
. the London Corresponding Society; he and
those who acted with him are only affected by
. the Scotch Convention, as far as that conven-
. tion acted under their authority, or with their
: approbation; as faras thev acted under their
authprity—they are not attected by any thing
but this resolution. When the convention
met they came to some resolutions which I
do not find myself interested upon this occa-
sion to detend any farther than this, that they
certainly are not overt acts of high treason; to
them the same answer applies as applies to
_ this resolution; they do not amount to any
conspiracy for the purpose of raising or levy-
ing a war against the king’s person; nothin
likeit; and, therefore, though they are sack
asa quiet and reasonable man would disap-
prove, yet they are not such as amount to the
, Crime of high treason. I beg you always,
' gentlemen, to hold it in your minds that the
question you have to try is, whether the pri-
' soner, and those persons, with whom he was
concerned, meant to call this convention for
the purpose of overturning the government,
and thereby deposing and destroying the king.
Now you will not find throughout the whole
course of these proceedings any evidence tes-
tifying that intent; you will find strong lan-
guage used in letters that are written, very
strong, perhaps—strong resolutions, but none
of them amount to a proof of the crime with
which he is charged; nor does it appear to
me, however criminal they were, that he
ought to be charged with any of the acts of
that convention; none of them were high
treason undoubtedly.

But how do they endeavour to fix them
upon Mr. Hardy and those with whom he
acted? merely by showing that when irritated
at the fate of their delegates, whom they had
sent there, and at that which they were told,
trom high authority, was a horrid and unjus-

a Sir John Freind’s case, anté, Voi. 13,
Pp. 61,


tifiable judgment against them, they passed
some violent, 1 will say, indecent resolutions
upon the subject. ,

Something is due to the human mind in
that state; you will not be extreme to mark
what is amiss in a case of this sort; you will
look to the intention, and see if any thing is
proved against this prisoner, which can brin;
home to his mind the criminal act charge:
upon this indictment, and unless you find
some one act which furnishes plain direct and
manifest proof, in the words of lord Coke, of
a conspiring to overturn the government and
depose the king, you will cast out of your
mind such expressions as I am alluding to,
and you will find, however you may disap-
prove of his conduct in some respects, that he
1s not guilty of that high crime which is now
imputed to him.

It is said (I think it is uot supportable in
law) that these delegates who met in conven-
tion in Scotland were guilty of high treason,
and that therefore Mr. Hardy, who was one
of a suciety who sent delegates, and who
might approve the proceedings that passed
there, that he also is guilty of high treason. I
cannot bring myself to believe that it was
really thought that the proceedings of the con-
vention in Scotland brought the crime of high
treason home to those who assented to them
here; because I cannot understand how the
conspiring here to do that can be high trea-
son which was not high treason in those who
did the thing in Scotland. You know very
well, gentlemen, that the delegates, who sat
in that convention, were prosecuted ; but they
were not prosecuted for high treason, but for
a misdemeanor. ‘The lord justice Clerk had
the’same evidence befure him on that subject
that you have now; ifit had been hightreason
heywould have done that which it was his duty
to do; he would not have tried the prisoners
for a misdemeanor—he would have told the
jury, on the first trial, that they must find the
prisoner not guilty of the misdemeanor, be-
cause his offence was of a greater magnitude ;
and a person. must not be brought to trial for
a misdemeanor when the facts amount to
proof of a higher crime. WhatI say upon
this subject is law, his lordship will tell you
so, that if a man be indicted for a crime of a
lower description, and upon the trial the evi-
dence goes to prove that he was guilty of one
of a higher description, he cannot in law be
convicted of that crime of a lower description ;
and therefore I have the authority of the
court of justiciary in Scotland ; the authority
of those who instituted and conducted those
prosecutions for misdemeanor only, to say that
the meeting of the Scotch Convention, the
acts of the delegates (1 am not speaking of
Downie and Watt, they were not connected
with them) were not high treason, and, there-
fore, the conspiring here to bring about these
acts could not be so. ‘

Gentlemen, these appear to me to be the
general observations arising out of the mass

of evidence, with which we are loaded in this
cause, and from which the counsel for the
crown would persuade you to believe, that the

risoner, and those with whom he acted, have

een guilty of high treason. I come now to
the parol evidence, and I beg again and again
to bring to your recollection that the question
upon this part of the case is, whether the pri-
soner in conspiring to call together this con-
vention meant to depose the king :—I come
now to that parol evidence by which the
crown has endeavoured to su port this posi-
tion, that the direct object of all these societies
was, to drive the king from his throne, and
thereby to compass his death.

The first two witnesses whom they called
upon this subject were, two men from Sheffield,
Camage and Broomhead; they are witnesses
for the crown, and therefore their evidence is
unimpeachable as far as it makes for us most
certainly. They are called to prove that pre-
parations were made to support measures of
violence by which this convention was to
carry its projects into execution; for you
know, gentlemen, to suppose that a conven-
tion was to be called that were to act with
force against the whole body of the govern-
ment, and to depose the king, and notto show
that that convention was furnished with some-
thing like adequate means to effect that in-
tention, would be absurd and nonsensical.

They found it incumbent upon them, there-
fore, to lay before you pat that the prisoner,
and those with whom he acted, had prepared
means for supporting this convention by force
against the whole armed body of the govern-
ment. For this purpose they call Camage
and Broomhead, and certainly they both do
prove some of the facts, at least, which the
crown called them to prove;—they proved
that some pikes were prepared at Sheffield : I
admit it—but how does the fact come eut
upon their cross-examination? What was
the purpose for which these pikes were pre-
pared? Watch the account that the witnesses
for the crown who were called before you to
tell you all the truth, and whose evidence you
-TMust attend to, as far as it makes for the
prisoner, as well as against him, and must
give equal credit to it,—see the reason they
give for making these pikes ; they say they
were made by aparty to whom they, the
witnesses, belong, because they had ground,
just and reasonable ground to apprehend that
they should themselves be attacked by the
opposite party. Broomhead had been beset
in his house; inflammatory hand-bills had been
sent abroad; a gun had been fired under
‘the door of one of their houses, and that gun
had been fired by a member of an armed
body, who were of political sentiments oppo-
site to the society. Then what becomes of
the line of evidence which is directed by the
crown to this object; namely, to show that
the prisoner, and those who acted with him,
had been conspiring with the people at Shef-
field to procure pikes for the purpose of sup-


porting this convention, when it should te
called against the whole power of the
ment of this country? They had prepared
ikes, but their own witnesses tell you why they
prepared them; they had prepared themte
cause their persons their houses, and their ives
were not safe; they had actually been attacked,
their houses assailed, and inflammatory han
bills had been circulated round the town, 2
viting people to attack them by force, and ther
thought they might legally do that which they
will never be toldthey may not legally do, tht
when attacked they may repel force by force,
and may make preparation for such resistance,
if they have reason to expect an attack.

The late history of this country shows hew
necessary this measure was, and some inst
ces which I shall state, show to how
purposes such force may be applied. We bare
not forgotten the calamities of doctorPriestiey,
at Birmingham; we know that there a mb,
because they happened to differ from him ad
some friends of fs in political opinions, beet
his house, and rased it to the id; woold
it not have been lawful for doctor Priestky
upon that occasion, to have opposed that fore,
and to have prepared for it, if he had forewea
it? Then was it not lawful for these peopk,
when they had notice from the opposite party
that they should be attacked; when they bad
actually in some instances been attacked;
when inflammatory hand-bills had bea
sent round the town for the purpose of a-
citing people to attack them, was it tha
unlawful in them to prepare the means of de
fence against such an attack? and how is the
preparation made by them of these arms fr
their defence to be construed into an act of
high treason in Mr. Hardy, because, truly,
Mr. Hardy laine member of the Comes
ponding Society here, has corresponded wih
a ieabe of the Sheffield Society, of whrh
society these men who had so provided for the
defence of their persons and houses, wet
members. This is coming at treason, not by
plain, direct, and manifest proofs ; not evenby
that by which lord Coke says it oughtnot tote
come at, by inferences, butcoming at itby fake
and unfounded reasoning; it isassigning too
cause what the evidence ascribes to another;
it is attributing to these people a design whit
they certainly had not, and which the w+
nesses who proved the fact of their having the
pikes state they had not, thereby to implicate
ina supposed lesign, which was never enle-
tained by these men, the prisoner, who hid
no sort of connexion with them.

Not only doctor Priestley was attacked
Birmingham, but Mr. Walker ® and other pe
sons were attacked in the same manne t
Manchester. We know also that Mr. Dent
son, at Nottingham was so attacked, buthir-
ing notice of it before-hand, he did pnvie
himself with arms to defend himself sist
that attack ; he used those arms, be was he
em


‘

mayor of Nottingham, the first magistrate of
the place, and two of the rioters who attacked
his house fell, and the inquest upon that
death found it justifiable homicide. What
would have been the fate of Mr. Dennison, if
he had not prepared himself with those means
of defence ?—his house would have been rased
te the ground, as doctor Priestley’s was, and
another disgrace would have fallen upon this
country, by the destruction of the property of
an innocent man, because he had not the
means of defending himself against an illegal
attack,

These instances show not only the neccs-
sity, but the legality of providing arms against
such attacks, when we are furnished with
means of foreseeing them. But, gentlemen,
not only do they take off all effect from that
fact which was proved on the part of the
crown, that pikes had been provided at Shef-
field, but they prove something more. You
observe that all the members of the Consti-
tutional and London Corresponding Societies,
and the Societies at Sheftield are endeavoured
to be implicated in a general plot to calla
convention for the purpose of deposing the
king, and upon that ground the declarations
and acts of all those people are received in
evidence against us; we have a right then to
ask them, when any of them are called here,
what their views were ; if their views were to
calla convention for the purpose of deposing
the king, so far the plot is proved. Then
what do the witnesses say? Camage and
Broomhead are called by the crown, they say
they had no idea of attacking the King, or the
House of Lords; they had no idea of any
thing but calling a convention which might
make known to the House of Commons what
was the pois opinion of the people; they
had no idea of effecting the views of the con-
vention by force, but only by the progress of
reason; they meant to collect what was the
general opinion of the people of the country,
and if it should turn out to be the general opi-
nion that this reform of parliament ought to
be effected, then they believed, and I believe
too, that the House of Commons would listen
to that opinion so signified to them.

Another witness whom they called is Wid-
dison. He comes from the same place, and
you will recollect here that there had been

given in evidence a letter from one Davison
of Sheflield, to Mr. Hardy, stating what was
true, that the patriots at Sheffield had provided
themselves with pikes for their defence ; it is
insisted that this defence was alla pretext,
but when you come to hear the witnesses for
the crown you see that it was not a pretext,
that there was real danger of an attack. This
Davison writes to Mr. Hardy, informing him
that the patriotshad provided themselves with
pikes for their defence, and telling him where
their friends in London might supply them-
selves with pikes, if they thought proper, for
the same purpose. It is imputed to Mr. Hardy
the receiving this letter shows that he


meant to provide this convention, or those
who vere Ae act ame the opaxenten, with
arms for the purpose of supporti! ir pre-
tensions by force. It tent out that this letter
contains another letter, to Norwich, which
Mr. Hardy was desired to forward; both the
letter to Mr. Hardy, and the letter for Nor~
wich, remained in Mr. Hardy’s ssion
from April 26th to the 12th of May, when
they were seized ; he does not send that letter
to Norwich, and he never mentions to his di-
vision that he had received such a letter; he
never proposes to any of them to furnish them-
selves with arms. What then isthe fair con-
clusion to be drawn from these facts? You
were in danger at Sheffield, and you provided
yourselves with pikes there, and you did right
In doing so; but we do not yet feel there is
the same danger in London; we do not be-
lieve that we shall be attacked ; therefore
Mr. Hardy takes no notice of this communica-
tion; he does not send the letter to Norwich,
Nor state it to his division, or to any of his
friends in London, except in the instance I
shall mention presently. I say he took no
step upon it, because he is desired to address
any answer to one Moody at Sheffield, who is
afterwards called asa witness by the crown, and
who swore positively that no letter from Mr.
Hardy, or any of the society, ever came to his
hands; a conclusive proof that nothing was
done by Mr. Hardy, or any of his society,
at least with his knowledge, upon that letter,
and it is, therefore, conclusive proof that he
did not mean, upon a concert between him
and Davison, to use these arms which were
rovided at Sheffield for the protection and
lefence of that society, he did not mean to
use them against the government of the
country.

Widdison, who is called also to this fact of
the pikes, is cross-examined by us as to the
purposes of their institution; he and they all
Join in telling you their object was only parlia-
mentary reform, that they wished to obtain it
by peaceable means; that they meant to call
this convention, not in order that they might
oppose the government forcibly, not in order
that they might take upon themselves the
functions of parliament, not that they might
enforce their opinions by dint of arms, but
merely that they might represent to the House
of Commons, what was the opinion of the
majority of the people.

Hill, another witness, also states the same
things ; he proves they had the pikes, but he
proves that they were provided for the same
purpose. Then great reliance is placed upon
the evidence of Edwards; it is said that Mr.
Hardy did communicate this letter to Ed-
wards, and furnished him with the means of
getting these pikes. Now how did he com-
municate it to him?—Edwards, a forward
man, asks him (and it was publicly known
that these people at Sheffield had been thus
beset, and had provided themselves with these
pikes; it was no secret); Edwards comes to

Hardy and asks him if he could give him the
direction to a person who made the pikes at
Sheffield; Hardy having this letter in his
pocket, never having communicated it to a
single soul (for, if be had, the prosecutors
would have knownit, for they have had spies
upon him for these three years), being asked
by Edwards for a direction to a man at Shef-
field, he does give him that direction, and that
is the only use Hardy ever makes of the letter
he received from Shetteld, and he makes no
use whatever of the inclosure to Norwich;
Hardy did not want any of these pikes—
how came Edwards to ask for them? Not
from any communication he had with Har-
dy; he is the crown’s witness, and what he
says on one side must be believed, as well
as what he says on the other; he had it, he
says, for the purpose of defending himself, if
illegally stat ba, He says great insults had
been offered him, and it was for that purpose
only that he desired a direction to this man.
He made one for himself. Is Mr. Hardy
answerable for all his acts? And if he were,
what does this amount to? Entertaining, per-
haps, a fulse idea of a danger that threatens
him, he chose to provide himself with a pike,
and to advise two or three other persons to do
the same thing. Is this evidence that can
convince any reasonable mind, or can go a
Step towards convincing a man of common
Teason that these pikes were procured by Mr.
Hardy, and those he acted with, for the pus-
pose of supporting this convention which was
to be called, for the purpose of resisting by
force the whole united military of this king-
dom, and all the armed associations whic
have been raised in the country ?— Three
doren pikes in the hands of a few Sheffield
men, and in the hands of a few others into
whose hands Mr. Hardy might have put sixty
muskets and three French case knives, against
the whole army of England! Now is that
credible? Can you give ear to such a story?
You observe this convention was to be called
peat soon:—Can you believe that men who
ly entertained in their minds an idea of
enforcing by dint of arms the acts of this con-
vention which was just about to be called,
would have taken no farther steps for pro-
viding themselves with the means of support-
ing them, than three dozen of pikes, an order
only I think for sixty muskets, and less than
half a dozen of French case knives?
Gentlemen, my learned friend suggests to
me a fact that fell trom a witness to-day when
I was not in court, and I am very much
obliged to him for it, as certainly it strengthens
my observation extremely; he informs me
that a witness being asked how many pikes
they could have procured in Sheffield (if they
had wanted them) in the course of one day,
tells you that they could have procured ten
thousand. Why then, gentlemen, it is no
excuse that though their wants might be large,
the means of providing them were not sutli-
cienuy large; they had nothing to do but to


signify what they wanted, and if they hed
meant to support this convention by force ia
Shetheld, in the must disaffected plece, as my
learned triend says, that existed in the coum
try, they might have raised an army of pase
men; that is, supposing they had numbes
sufficient, into whose hands they might tar
put them, they might have provided te
thousand pikes in the course of a day; am
yet this plan of arming for the support of tk
convention, which is stated, I think, to tur
commenced so early as the year 1792. whxb
continued froin that time down to the 12h a
May, 1794, this array preparing against te
government of the country, though it mkt
have been provided with ten thousand pices
in the course of a day, had for its supp«t oo
more than three dozen of pikes ; and I dom
know whether it was an order, or only 2c
versation, about an order, for sixty musket
for the Lambeth Association, and three a
four French knives. The absurdity and
probability of the thing stares me in the face.

If these people had the will, they had me
means; and you are to try whether ther ind
the will; you are to try whether it was tle
intention of these people to call this conve
tion, and then to act themselves, through iis
convention, by force of arms; now if yuu ind
them making no preparation for this, if re
find them not prepared to attack a sinzk
company of guards, if it resisted them ; it be-
comes incredible that they should enternm
any such project. In most cases of projected
insurrection that we know from history, «
collect from the State Trials, there is either
party in the country in arms to which the m
surgents can immediately attach themselves,
or else there are preparations for the levvze
troops, which troops are to be collected, ead
to be formed into a body at the time that th
conspirators themselves are to rise ; but here
there is a convention to meet immediatels,
and yet no proof of that, without which thy
indictment cannot stand fora moment, no prot
of any levies on fcot, nor any preparations i
raising that force with which it is pretemied
the convention was to act.

Gentlemen, another witness whom the
called is Samuel Williams, and he is to prove
not only that Mr. Hardy had provided himet
with pikes to enforce thedecrees of this cov
vention, but also that he had embodied a fe
of musketeers to serve under it. Now wht
does that evidence amount to?

Mr, Samuel Williams, whois a gun engrave,
and by that means connected with gun-smiths

or not, I do not say, but it certainly is not an
act of high treason. Seeing that other people,
whom he thought no better affected than him-
self, had raised men, armed, and drilled them,

_ it-was not unnatural that he should be desirous
_ of doing the same, especially as he had been

in the army before; a sort of esprit du corps

‘that might belong to my learned friend. I

remember myself being in arms, and acting
asa lieutenant under him (Mr. Erskine] at
the time of the riots in the year 1780, and
very proud we were of our arms, regimentals

‘we had not, but very proud we were of: our

muskets. I remember no orders from go-
vernment to do this, no commission from the
lord lieutenant; but as other people asso-
ciated for the same purpose round us, we did
it also; and Mr. Franklow instituted his asso-
ciation in the same way; it was a known
public thing, there were printed orders and
regulations, and he went publicly about in his
uniform, To say that because that unfor-
tunate man at the bar recommended Williams
to furnish Franklow’s association with two or
three guns, therefore he must be presumed,
without farther proof, to have assisted m_rais-
ing an armed body for the purpose of sup-
porting this convention by force against’ the

.


established government of the country, is the
most alarming proposition I ever heard ina
court of justice.—If proofs like these are to
implicate a man in the highest crimes, by
what caution can innocence itself be secured
against such a perversion of evidence? Merci-
ful God! how do we expect that thou wilt
look upon us at the great day of judgment if
we thus scan the acts of our fellow-creatures
here? Because a man happens in communi-
cation with another, who is his customer, to
recommend him to provide a few muskets
for persons who are raising an association,
which might, or might not be legal, therefore
itis to be inferred that he meant these guns
to arm this convention, or their troops, for the
purpose of waging war against the govern-
ment; it is a monstrous conclusion, it would
be too disgraceful a thing to insist upon, were
it not that there are other circumstances,
which I know the solicitor-general will rely
upon in his reply, and from which, taking
them altogether (for no one of them, taken
separately, furnishes any colour of argument),
he wishes you to draw the conclusion whic!
this indictment endeavours to affix upon the
risoner, namely, that he has compassed the
ing's death. ;
Gentlemen, the next witness whom they
call is Gosling, and Mr. Gosling is one of
that infamous set of men (for so surely I may
call them) who, having no means of support-
ing themselves, endeavour to procure a Tive-
lihood by insinuating themselves into the se-
crets of others, and discovering them to the
government; I do not say that men are not
to be charged with acts of theirs discovered
by spies, but I say that a man of this descrip-
tion, who gives evidence against persons into
whose confidence he has endeavoured to in-
sinuate himself, is to be heard and attended
to with very great caution and reserve; his,
value rises according to the importance of his
testimony, he is a more or less valuable wit-
ness according as the acts which he commu-
nicates to his employers are more or less cri-
minal; he is interested therefore to enhance
them, and to that motive it is that I attri-
bute a great deal of the testimony of Gosling.
If a man of this description goes through
his evidence fairly, without any objection
arising upon the manner in which he gives
his testimony ; if he relates to you a plain,
regular, conekitent series of facts, I admit that |
you ought to attend to him. But recollect, |
gentlemen, how this man demeaned himself
upon his cross-examination. In his exami-
nation in chief he was fluent, he was easy ;,
he had all his facts ready, and he stated them
all precisely ; but he sunk under my learned
friend when he came to the cross-examina- ,
tion, he was confounded and abashed. I shall
not pretend to go through the whole of his
evidence, the day would not admit of it; but
I remember he stated that one of those per-
sons, whom they would have implicated in
the guilt of the prisoncr, said he had been
4D

going about the country, to corrupt the sol-
diers, that he bad corrupted a considerable
number of them, but he had found many
who stood out againsthim. Now, if thathad
been true, you would have had here all those
soldiers who resisted him, as witnesses; there
could be no difficulty in calling them, it was
an easy thing for government to have col-
lected who the men were whom this person
had unsuccessfully attempted to tamper with,
and their not being able to discover any of
those men whom he had so unsuccessfully
attempted to corrupt; there not heing
called a single witness of that description
to support the evidence given by Gos-
ling upon that subject, is a plain proof to
me that his evidence in that respect was not
true; add to that observation upon his evi-
dence, the manner in which he deported
himself upon his cross-examination, the diffi-
culty my learned friend had to get from him
any answers to the plainest questions that he
put, and I think you will have no doubt to
say that what he swears unsupported by any
other witnesses, speaking directly to the same
facts, is not deserving of any credit in a cause
Tike this.

Gentlemen, another witness of this des-
cription is Lynam, his evidence lasted five or
six hours; itis utterly impossible for me to
ge through it literally, but you recollect that

e spoke from notes he had taken, in which
he entered short memorandums; he had
mistaken a great number of naines which he
had entered in these notes, Curtis for Carter,
&c. as far as they went they were full of mis-
takes, and there was hardly a single fact that
hie spoke of which fixed any degree of crimi-
nality upon Mr. Hardy, or those with whom
he was connected, that was found in his notes,
but he related those facts from his memory ;
if the notes of what he wrote down are so in-
correct as to confound one name with another,
what credit can you give to his recollection?
He tells you that he did not attend to the
particular persons who held the conversations
of which he speaks, but that this, and that
general conversation, passed at these meet-
logs. '
Gentlemen, I will tell you why he said
this; it might have been dangerous to be
more particular ; he might have been contra-
dicted ; and any thing that had been said, by
any of those people, he knew was ruled to be
evidence of the general plot; consequently
what he stated to have been said in general
conversation, among them there was evi-
dence.—Who told you this?—Who are the
people that used th sse expressions? From
whom did you collect that? He does not
know; he did not think it material to ob-
serve.—What! a spy; a man whose busi-
ness it was to collect information for govern-
Ment; a man, who attended the mectings

merely for the purpose of coming afterwards |

and giving evidence against these people—

Did not he think it material, at the time


when he attended, to collect the names of
those who suid this or that particular thing?
—Did he not know, that there was a great
deal of difference in the degree of criminality,
in those who said a thing, and those who were
only present when it was said? Did not hs
common sense tell himthat?— Oh! no! hepad
noattention tothat; only that the conversatica
did pass. To the memory of awitness, who gives
you thisaccountofhisattention to such matens
conversations as he pretends to describe, I
think no credit is to be given.— Y ou will ob-
serve, whether the evidence he gives of any
particular facts, is confirmed by other wa-
nesses of a different description, and to whow
testimony no objection lies ;—ifit is, you wil
so far give credit to him, but otherwise joa
will not.

There is another witness of the Lambeth
Association brought forward to prove ths
detestable plot, and that is Mr. Coates,
Franklow’s apprentice. The account he gives
of this Lambeth Association is, that it was
public, that Franklow had a cartouch ber is
true, but that cartouch box lay open, with
others, upon the work board; he rez
mentals, but we heard in evidence befure,
that he appeared in them, publicly, at the
Globe-tavern. .

They come next, gentlemen, to the evi-
dance of a Mr. Groves, aud I beg your part-
cular attention to him.—Mr. Groves's evr
dence had two objects; one was to show,
that Mr. Hardy, in fartherance of the des.za
which is imputed to him, and for the sake of
arming this convention, which was to act by
force against the government, bad provided
himself with French knives.—A nother object
was to show, that, ata meeting, held on the
second of May, at the Crown and Anchor,
such language had been held, by persuns
connected with Mr. Hardy, and the same
society, as showed, demonstratively, that ther
must mean to overturn the king, and his go
vernment.

Now, in the first place, let us see how
Groves, in his examination in chief, relates
these facts. With respect to the knives, he
tells you, that he was at Chalk Farm; that
he was in a shed with about ten people; that
five or six of them pulled out a little instru-
ment, all exactly alike, which were French
knives, and that Pearce was one of them;
that somebody said, they were bread and
cheese knives, and then a smile went round;
that he asked, where they might be got; they
said, at Green’s, in Orange-street, who was &
perfumer and hair-dresser; he says, a week
after he went to buy one; and then his ob:et
is to show you, that Green had sold a great
number of these kuives, for the purpose of
arming this convention, or their army; aod
that he had sold them in such a way as »
show, that he was sensible of the impzopnety
of what he was about; he says, Greea uid

him he had sold two or three hundred; be
says, 4:¢ told me to speak very low, for the

parlour door’ was open, and his wife wasa
damn’d aristocrat. It is evident he meant,
that it should be inferred from hence, that
Green, who was one of this society, had
plotted with Mr. Hardy, for arming this mul-
titude that were to support this convention ;
that he had contrived to procure these knives
from Sheffield, for the purpose of arming
them, and had alrcady collected a body of
two or threc hundred, thus armed.

* Another object that he had, was, to collect
the sense of the society, from what passed at
the meeting, on the 2nd of May, at the Crown
and Anchor; and he tells you, that Mr.
Horne Tooke was there, and it is out of his
mouth that he collects this.— Mr. Horne
Tooke, he says, after dinner got up; he ob-
served, that he supposed, one vut of fifty of
the people who were there, might be consi-
dered as spies, and to them he wished parti-
cularly to address himself; the witness did
therefore attend to what he said. Mr. Tooke
desired the company to observe, that he was
Not in a state of inebriation, for, having some-
thing to say to the company, he had refrained
from his glass. He called the parliament a
scoundrel sink of corruption; he called the op-
position in parliamenta scoundrel sink of oppo-
sition ; he said, that there was a junction be-
tween these two scoundrel parties, formed for
thepurpose of destroying the rights and liberties
of the country ; he spoke about the heredi-
tary nobility of the country; he asked, if that
skip-jack, Jenkinson, could be considered as
one of the hereditary nobility. He was
asked, how Mr. Tooke had treated the Lords;
he said, speaking metaphorically, for which
his lordship, I remember, corrected him, that
he had paid the Lords pretty much the same
compliment that he had the House uf Com-
Mmons; from thence he meant, to be sure,
that it should be collected, that he had spoken
of it as of the Commons; that is, that it was
a sink of corruption, and ought to be purified.
These are the two main facts of which he
gives evidence.

Now see how this comes out in the course
of the cross-examination. First, with respect
to Mr. Tooke; you remember, that the ques-
tion here is, whether the prisoner has con-
spired to call this Convention, for the purpose
of deposing the king, and that this witness
was examined for the purpose of proving,
that language had been held indicative of an
intention to overturn the government, and to
depose the king; and that this Groves, in his
examination in chief, stated to you, that Mr.
Tooke had so spoken of the House of Com-
mons, and of the House of Lords.—How does
it come out upon his cross-examination? T
asked him, leading him as I might, he being
a witness for the crown, whether Mr. Tooke
had not said, that the hereditary nobility in
the country, were a body ever to be respected?
He said, yes, he had; he always had. I:
asked him, whether his complaint had not
been, that, by corruption, improper men were


drafted out from the House of Commons into
the House of Lords, by which the Lords were
degraded. He said his complaint was, that
the sending such men into the Ilouse of
Lords was a disgrace to those who have here-
ditary seats there. I asked him then, whe-
ther he did not speak with high respect and
regard, both of the office and person of the
king? He said, yes; he always had; he
spoke of this as trenching upon the authority
of the king, and that he did not say one word
disrespectful to majesty.

Then what does this evidence amount to P
—See what is the question between us.—We
say, that the object of these men was mcrely
a parliamentary reform; that they wished to
bring about annual parliaments and uni-
versal suffrage; that their complaint was
of corruption in the House of Commons;
they thought a parliamentary reform would
remedy the evil, and they meant to call
a convention for that purpose. On the
other side, they say, it was not for that pur-

se, but for the press of deposing the

ing; and they call a witness to prove, out
of Mr. Tooke’s mouth, that that was his ob-
ject. What does Mr. Tooke say? He says,
that the evil lay inthe House of Commons ;
so says the prisoner at the bar, and so he
always has said; so all those that ever acted
with him have said ; that it was the corrup-
tion in the House of Commons which had
given birth to the evils he complained of, and
that therefore the representation. in the
House of Commons ought to be reformed.
We say, that they never meditated any altera-
tion in the House of Lords, or any attack
upon the king; so says this witness, who is
called to prove the contrary ; he swears that
Mr. Tooke, whose language they are making
use of against Mr. Hardy, always said, that
the hereditary nobility of the country were a
respectable body; that his complaint was,
that members of the House of Commons,
who did not deserve it, were removed into
the House of Lords; that the king sires
deserved respect; and yet this witness is call-
ed to prove, and that from Mr. Touke’s
mouth, that the object of this convention was
to dethrone the king. .

Consider, gentlemen, how very strong this
evidence is for us, when it comes out of the
mouth of the prosecutor's witness. — We
admit, that the object was to induce the
Honse of Commons, hearing the general sense
of the people, to reform the representation.
This is the opinion of Mr. Tooke; this is the
language which he held, and which he held in
the presence of that spy.

These observations go completely, not only
to put this evidence of Mr. Groves out of the
case, as bearing upon this cause, but they go
farther, in two respects. First, they go to
show (and I am entitled to the full strength
of that application of them) that the object,
and the only object of these people, was a
reform in the House of Commons; that a ~

‘man, charged to be connected with them
in this conspiracy, did, in their face, abso-
lutely negative any design upon the king, or
the House of Lords; that he confined his
complaints to the House of Commons; that
he spoke with respect of the person and of
the office of the king, and yet this witness is
called to prove, that they wished to drive the
king out of his place in the constitution; he
proves the direct contrary; he proves, that
the object of all the people there assembled,
spoken by the voice of Mr. Tooke (I say, that
was the object of them all, because none con-
tradicted him) was, to maintain the dignity of
the House of Lords, and to maintain the per-
son and dignity of the king.

Gentlemen, that is not the only use of the
evidence of this man; it furnishes us with a
fearful example, how much mischief may be
done by the evidence of spies; we have no
means of correcting their evidence; we know
not what will be the course of it; we have
no clue ta cross-examine them; and it was
mere accident, that his testimony did not
leave upon your minds the impression, that
Mr. Tooke, in this large assembly, had de-
clared himself against both the House of
Commons, and the House of Lords; for he
expressly said, at first, that he complimented
the House of Lords in the same way that be
did the House of Commons, and so we should
have been fixed with this imputation, that,
sitting at diuner with Mr. Tooke, and five
hundred people, all of whom are attempted to

~be connected in this plot, we countenanced a

doctrine which was publicly broached in that
assembly, that all the Lords and Commons
were a sink of corruption, and, consequently,
that an attack was levelled at them all ; what
a situation then would my client have been
in, from our not knowing how to examine
the witness; from our not knowing how to
lead him to the truth, which he kept back,
and which he knew to be material, and which
he ought, upon his oath, to have told upon
his examination in chief; from our not hav-
ing the clue to his cross-examination, that
man at the bar might have been condemned
to the extreme punishment of high treason,
None but a spy so demeans himself 3 None
but a dishonest man; none but a miscreant,
like him, seeps back, in his examination in
chief, all that he thinks will make for a pri-
soner, and delivers all that is against him.
I am entitled to say he did so; and from
thence entitled to caution you, how you credit
the testimony of such witnesses, unless you
find their evidence confirmed by other wit-
Nesses, speaking to the same fact.

Gentlemen, 1 have not done with Groves
yet; he has beem guilty not only of a sup-
Pression of the truth, but he has been guilty
of direct perjury; a perjury, committed by
him, for the putpose of enhancing his own
value with those by whom he is employed, at
the price of that man’s life; a crime which, I
am sorry to say, is not in law murder; that,


Lilt

however, was his object, and I will shew you
it was his object. I observed, that another
part of his evidence went to show, that Greea
was a conspirator with the rest in this plet;
that he had conspired to assist this conves-
tion by force, and, in the prosecution of that
conspiracy, had already sold two or three
hundred knives, for the purpose of arming
the conspirators.

Groves says, he went to Green's, ~for the
purpose of purchasing one of those knives;
that all was secrecy; Green told him “to spesk
low, for the parlour door was open, and his
wife was a damn’d aristocrat. Now the anly
object that he could have in so representsg
the thing was, to make you believe, tht
Green sold these knives in private. Greenis
afterwards called, as a witness for the crowa,
and what is the account that he gives of this?
Ile tells you, that, in the fair and ordingry
course of trade, he had three dozen of these
knives, and he had sold, I think, thirteeper
fourteen, each to a different person; he hed
them sent to him in packages, of six or seven
in a package ; he says, he sent one yackagen
Mr. Hardy, but that part does not apply te
Groves’s evidence, . .

‘This evidence is, you see, inconsistent with
the account that Groves gives ; this, however,
may not affect Groves with perjury ; because,
though this is the truth, Green may have
given a different account to Groves. Withs
view to ascertain that, he is asked, did you
ever tell Groves you had sold two or thre
hundred ?—O ! never! he asked, if the knives
were a saleable commodity: I said they were.
To be sure, every man will talk in that way of
his own wares; there Groves is
contradicted. Did you say any thing, testify-
ing any apprehension about selling them?
Nothing upon earth ; the knives, he says, hy
in the show glass, open to the view of the
public, a public article of sale ; and yet Groves
tells you, that he sold to him, privately, and
would not let even his wife know, that be
sold one of these knives. But here we pia
him to a direct fact. Groves says, in terms,
that Green told him (Groves) that his wie
was a damn’d aristocrat, and desired him net
to speak so loud, because the parlour door was
open. Now Green, a witness, who is likewie
called by the crown, swore, most positively,
not only that he did not use the expressions
imputed to him by Groves, but also, that be
neither mentioned his wife, nor made use of
the word Aristocrat. Then here we have one
of the crown’s witnesses, positively and directly
contradicting another of the crown’s witnesses,
as to a very material fact, slid in by Groves,
that these knives were scld by Green, under
an apprehension of fear, and in secrecy: it

‘oes farther ; for, in stating that Green ssid
is wife was a damn’d aristocrat, he meant
you should infer that he, and those with whom
he acted, were men of a contrary priuciple,
apd men who meant improperly to use these
knives. You see the turn be gives it, is em

deavouring to disti between aristocrats,
and those who had french knives; that his
wife was not to see him sell these knives, be-
cause she was a damn’d aristocrat, meaning
that Green would have it understood, that he
sold these knives to persons of a contrary
deseription, but would not have her know it,
because she, being of different principles,
would disapprove of it. With these observa-
tions I dismiss this witness ; he not only does
not prove any thing that would be advantage-
ous to the crown, but his evidence is material
for the prisoner, and he furnishes you with a
lesson, which, I hope, you will not forget,
when you are to decide upon the evidence of

f persons of his description.

T have done with so much of Green’s evi-
dence as relates to the contradiction to Groves.
But there is another thing which Green, a
witness for the crown, swears to, and which
falls in with the rest of our evidence. He is
asked, whether he, being a member of this
society, and acting with them upon many oc-
casions, whether he had any idea that this
society, or any deputation from them, or any

. convention to which they sent delegates, was

either to attack the person of the king, or to
effectuate any of their opinions by force of
arms? He tells you, in express terms, no, not
aman of us, had any such object; our object
was parliamentary reform; the means by
which we were to effect that parliamentary
reform, not being able to effect it by peti-
tions, was, by a convention, to act peaceably.
It was first to collect the opinion of the public,
and then to represent it to parliament.—We
hoped and believed, that that would turn out
tu be the public opinion, and that the public
opinion, being so peaceably represented to
parliament, would bave its due weight.

Then, gentlemen, after these witnesses,
who go to the proof of what had passed in
England, they endeavour to implicate us in
the guilt of Watt, who has been lately executed
for high treason, at Edinburgh, and for that
purpose they call Mr. M‘Ewan. There is no
way by which at at all connect Hardy with
Watt, except, I think, thata letter was sent
by Hardy to Skirving, who was a member of
a society to which Watt belonged; and in a
conversation between Watt and Stock, at
Eaiabiare, it appeared, that Watt was de-
Sirous of sending a letter to Hardy, and com-
municated with Stock, how he might send
that letter, without saying what it was about;
but no such letter appears ever to have been
sent; what the subject was upon which he
Meant to correspond with him, does not
appear; and yet it is in evidence to you, that

the letters that were sent to Mr. Hardy, I |

cannot say, positively, that it appears in evi-
dence that all were, but there is every reason

to suppose, that all the letters which were |

sent to Mr. Hardy, upon this subject, were
seized by the crown 3 so that, I think, you


that he personally knew that any such man
as Watt existed, and yet it is endeavoured to
affect him, by what Watt did in Edinburgh,
though none of the delegates who sat with
Watt there, are attempted to be affected by it.

Who is this Mr. Watt? Why Watt was a
spy, employed by government, up to a certain
extent; he was discharged by them from that
employment, I believe, because he over-valued
his services; so it appeared, I understand,
upon his own trial; being discharged by go-
vernment, he continues to associate with the
Scotch Convention, and he makes a violent
proposal there, which all who were present
reject; I do not mean that, in the convention,
he made the proposal; but among some of
the members, he made a proposal, which all
who were present instantly rejected.

Now I will tell you what I firmly believe
to have been the case. Watt had been a spy ;
he had carried communications to govern-
ment; he pretended, perhaps, to know more
than he did; he over-valued the communica-
tions he did carry, and therefore was discarded ;
he still fixed himself upon these men, who
did not know that he bad been a spy, and
kept company with him; and I do verily, in
my conscience, believe, that he made this
pespossl to them with a view to carry the in-
formation of it afterwards to government, and
then to hang these men, if he could get them
to agree with him. I believe that to be the
case ; I believe him to have been a determined
miscreant, and I am not sorry that he was
hanged, if that were the case, because he
justly deserved it; but having, as a spy,
carried information to government; having
required a higher price for his services than

vernment thought he deserved, he had

n discarded; he afterwards goes back, and

makes this proposal, which was rejected with |
abhorrence by them, and I do verily believe
he made this proposal for the sole purpose of
implicating them in the guilt of such a project,
that he might carry the information to
vernment, and thereby show he was worthy
of his hire; that he might show he was
worth the price he asked, Now take it cither
way; that te really meant to accomplish this

roject, or that, not meaning to accomplish it,
Es wished to draw other people into it, fur the
sake of sending them to the gallows, he has
met the fate he richly deserved.

But observe another thing. Watt is to be

| connected with Mr. Hardy. How? Through

the Scotch Convention; because Mr. Hardy
corresponded with the Scotch Convention,
and because Watt was a member of that con.
vention. Good God! have they attempted
to fix this guilt upon any of the delegutes to
the Scotch Convention, except those two
individuals, Watt and Downie ?—Govern-
ment has prosecuted all the indictments, E
suppose, that they mean to prosecute tor high
treason, in Scotland, and yet not one of these

may fairly infer, that no such letter was sent; | delegates with whom Watt was, at one time,
there is no evidence in the cause to show, | immediately connected, has been indicted for
‘ >

bit treason.—Why? because the high treason
of which Watt was guilty, consisted of a fact,
in which they had no participation, and much
less had the prisoner any participation in it.
Recollect what is the account M‘Ewan gives,
when this project was proposed to him by
Watt. He says, that they rejected it with ab-
horrence. Then, if those who were upon the

t rejected it with abhorrence ; if no imme-

te communication upon the subject is
proved between Watt and Hardy, will you, by
a long chain of implication and inferences, fix
that upon Mr. Hardy, which the officers of
the crown do not pretend that they can fix
upon those who were immediately connected
with Watt, the actor in it? It is impossible to
suppose, that men of common justice, and of
common humanity, can entertain such a
thought.

Another observation arises upon this evi-
dence of Mr. M‘Ewan; he is a Scotchman,
and he was a member of the Scotch Conven-
tion, and you have heard from him what he
thinks of the Scotch Convention, and I think
You have reason to believe from the manner
in which he gave his evidence that you
receive from him his real sentiments upon all
the subjects upon which he is questioned,
and a true relation of all the facts to which he
was examined; was there any difficulty in
getting from him this account of Watt? Did
not he immediately, upon being asked, com-
municate the whole story? Did not he express
his own abhorrence of it? I believe he came
voluntarily to give this account; I am sure
the contrary does not appear in the cause, and
Iam entitled, as counsel for the prisoner, to
insist that no fact exists which is not proved.
The witness came forward in the ordinary
course, and therefore I am entitled to suppose,
that coming forward in the ordinary course,
he did it voluntarily, in order to state facts to
“you, upon which you will have to reason
when you come to consider what verdict you
will give. When I say that no compulsory
means were used to bring this witness to the
bar, it is not because it is material to me
whether it le so or not, yet still I am entitled
to make that assumpticn.
, Now what is the account he gives of the
whole of this business? and here I am
answering that part of their case which en-
deavours to implicate us in the guilt of those
persons at Edinburgh. He states that there
was no idea of trenching on the authority of
the King, or Lords; that there was no idea of
assuming the functions of parliament; that
nothing was to be done by force, and the
very night on which they were dispersed, it
appears, they had considered upon petitioning
either the parliament, or the king: then, if
that were the case, what becomes of the charge
against the prisoner? If in all this vast field
ot evidence, which they have taken, they
cannot prove any design, hy means of this
convention in Scotland, to depose the king by
force, what becomes of the charge against Mr.


(tus

Hardy, who was not directly implicated eva
in what that convention really did? The
charge against him is, that he conspired, wit:
others, to call a convention, which conve-
tion was to act by force of arms against tk
povennitent of the country, and to depose the
ing. Surely the proceedings at Edinbas
furnish no proof of this sort against him.

I observe, and I dare say the fact will
relied upon, by the solicitor-general in reply,
that all the witnesses who have been que
tioned to these circumstances (their witnesses
as well as ours) were asked by the atlome-
general, whether they thought certain res
tions that were shown to them were peacute
and orderly? Some had seen them, sae
had not. Now I have nothing to dowd
their opinion upon the point, whether the
resolutions were peaceable or orderly. Th
question, in this cause, is not whether thez
people had come to peaceable and orderly m
solutions; but the question is whether ther
have committed an overt act the direct obet
of which was to depose the king, and te
ultimate object of which was to bring abon
his death; that is the question for your dete
mination. And it is very hard upon the pr
soner if dust is to be thrown inte the eyes
the jury, by endeavouring to fix their attentka
upon facts which do not amount to an art«l
high treason (for if one act does not, all taken
together cannot) for the sake of preventing
them from looking directly to that which 3
alone the object of their inquiry, name,
whether this prisoner did conspire, will
others, to destroy the king, when they
to call a convention? And it matters ot
whether this report of the secret commiliee
be full of obnoxious and offensive resolutions;
it matters not whether they are guilty of
the other crimes in the catalogue of crimizal
law: the sole question is, whether they hie
been guilty of high treason? whethet Hef
meant to call this convention for the purpot
of deposing the king? And when you
every one of the witnesses for the
whether they had any such intention; i
they tell you in plain direct words that Uey
had uo such intention; that their views *°*
peaceable, and that they meant only top
duce a parliamentary reform, by calling

accumulation of all these acts (offensive, Pe
haps, but not one of them amounting '

guilty of so high a crime, because you 4”

Gentlemen, I told you before I had the
; best authority for saying that the delegates in
. Scotland, none at least of them but Watt and
: Downie, had been guilty of high treason. I
. have the best authority for saying that, because
. Lhave the authority of diisae who prosecuted
them for a misdemeanor, and of the judges
before whom they were convicted of a misde-
; Meanor. If they were known to be guilty of
_ high treason, and yet were prosecuted for
. misdemeanors, it was not humanity so to
Prosecute them ; true humanity is to be shown
, tothe innocent, and not to the guilty; the
guilty should be punished up to the extent of
_ their crimes, but if these men were known to
be guilty of high treason, and yet were prose-
_ cuted only for misdemeanors, that prosecution
' becomes a snare to others; it holds out to
them that acts of this sort are not high
treason, it waits for their going on perhaps
till they have accomplished the act, and then
, the net is thrown over them; they are told,
this was a trap laid for you, we knew that
those others had been uty of high treason,
but we thought if we punished them as trai-
tors, you would not gu on ; you have gone on,
and now you must take the consequence; it is
nothing to you how we proceed against other
men; we will proceed against you as the law
is—we will proceed against you for high
treason, although we proceeded against them
only for misdemeanors. I say that is not true
humanity ; those persons who had been guilty
of high treason should have been punished as
traitors, and a trap should not have been laid
for those who at that time were innocent of
it; humanity should have been shown to
those who had not been then guilty of crimes,
and not to those who had. Ido not say that
this was the conduct either of the prosecutors
of these delegates, or of the judges who tried
them; but I ain entitled from their conduct

to assert this, that they did not believe them ©
that they

prosecuted them only for misdemeanors, be-
cause they knew them to be guilty only of
misdemeanors.

Gentlemen, I have stated to you the ground
upon which this prosecution is founded ; it is
compassing the king’s death. I have stated
to you that which I beg you always to hold in
your minds, that the foundation of this prose-
cution is, that the prisoner called this conven-
tion for the purpose of deposing the king. I
have stated to you that none of those acts
which are contained in the volume of written
evidence that has been laid before you, amount
to proof of that fact. I should have stated
before, it was an omission that I did not, but:
I will now state to you what I apprehend to
be the overt act charged in the indictment,
and relied upon in proof as fixing this crime
upon the prisoner; it consists in the resolu-
tion for calling a convention; the crime im-
puted is, that he resolved to call it for the
purpose of deposing the king.

Now I beg you to hear the language of that
resolution, as it was ultimately agreed to—
“ That it appears to this committee very de-
sirable thata general meeting, or Convention
of the Friends of Liberty should be called, for
the purpose of taking into consideration the
proper methods of obtaining a full and fair
representation of the people,” that is the overt
act with which the prisoneris charged. Wh,
then, gentlemen, ihe professed and avow
object of this convention by those who resolv-
ed that it should be called, was, not that
it should take arms into its hands, not that it
should entertain others who had arms in their
hands, but merely that it should take into its
consideration the proper methods of obtain-
ing a full and fair representation of the people.
This is the language which they hold through-
out all their resolutions, and I insist that there
is no direct evidence on the part of the crown
which shows that this is a mere pretext. I
shall come presently to that part of the case,
and to the grounds there are for saying this
was not a pretext; at present I am only consi-
dering how the evidence for the crown have
made out their case; upon this part of the
case you must believe, before you convict the
prisoner, not only that there was force pre-
pared, but that it was his intention that this
convention should use that force.

Now a very remarkable observation that
arises in the case is, that there is nota sin; le
tittle of evidence from the beginning to the
end which unites the project of the convention
with any thing of arms, that connects or
brings them together at all; they had spies
upon all their proceedings—all their meetings
were watched over—every member of the so-
ciety had, when in the society, and robably
at many other times, a man at his elbow who:
would give an account of every thing that

assed, and yet there is not a single word that -
has tallen fromany of the witnesses ; nota sin-

gle expression, I believe, to be found in all:
the written evidence, that connects the calling
of the convention with the preparation of any
force ; unless you connect the two together,
you cannot find the prisoner guilty upon this
charge in the indictment; there is no proo'
which can be stated to you, none that can be
left to your consideration without the parol
evidence that these men intended that the
convention should act by force; throughout
the written evidence they expressly disavow it.

You must believe men’s words, unless the
direct contrary is proved; but when the
crown has given in evidence this business of
arms, they tell you, and I am entitled to as-
sume it, that this is the force which those
members of the convention meant to use; if
there was any other they would show it, and’
the conclusion follows, that if they did not

mean to use this force, they meant to use’

none. The crown knew all they had done;
the question is, whether the convention meant
to use force; if the crown cannot prove they
Meant to use this force, they do not prove
they meant to use any; the case would have
been more strong, perhaps, upon that part of
it, if they had not called their witnesses, because
then you would have been told that a great
deal was to be left to fair presumption and in-
ference :—that though they had not proved
it, yet you were to presume it from the other
facts proved ; but they have taken upon them-
selves to show you what that force was which
this convention was to use, and they put it
upon the pikes, the muskets, and the knives.
Thee we have pretty well disposed of them

But supposing there was any thing serious
in this proof of the pikes, the muskets, and
the knives, there is no evidence connecting it
with the convention; and if it had been the
project of these people, if it had ever entered
into the minds of any of them that this force
should be used by that convention which they
intended to call, it is impossible that the
crown should not have been able to have laid
evidence of it before you. You see they have
spies every where; you see when we call a
witness, they know him better than we do;
they have had a man in every society in Lon-
don. They can ask when Mr. Stevens was
called, whether it was Mr. Stevens of Rath-
bone- place, or Mr. Stevens of the Minories.
They know them all, they have watched at
their elbows, they have been vigilant, and
they are to be commended for it; ie still it
fortifies my observation, that they know all
that is in this case; that nothing is left to
presumption, to inference ; that all that exists

as been brought forward by them, and that
you have nothing to form your judgment:
upen, except that which they have laid before
you; they have laid before you, therefore, all
which exists of arms; they have laid nothing
before you to show-that these arms were con-
nected in- any way with the convention:
‘Therefore, I bave-a right to assume that the

one out of that number and variety of tte
acts which are all woven up in this isinar
web that is now spread before you; not
which the prisoner, and those with when
acted, have not publiely avowed in the fe
of day. It may be said that if the acts
illegal, this adds to their illegality ; that te:
are not only illegal, but they are impute
but that does not make them high tres:
and it shows that what. these men profes
were really their objects ; it shows that the

Gentlemen, it would be idle 2 pat

1 think I have stated what is the general effect

' of the evidence of every witness we have call-
: ed; but I think there are two who were call-

ed last—I mean Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Fran-
cis, who spoke more particularly to this fact,

‘ and whose evidence will deserve more of

your consideration, because they show most
decidedly that the objects the prisoner has
always professed, were his real objects.
Gentlemen, you recollect the time when
there was an alarm in the kingdom, when the
militia was suddenly embodied, and parlia-

+ Tent was assembled. Parliament was as-

sembled, indeed, for the purpose of embody-
ing the militia, because without it the militia

> could not be embodied in a legal way; the

ground alleged for calling
ther was, that there were disturbances and
insurrections in the kingdom; there were
some gentlemen who thought that there did
not at that time exist those disturbances and
insurrections which were stated, and accord-
ingly an inquiry was instituted into the real
existence of them; upon that occasion Mr.
Hardy attended Mr. Sheridan, and Mr. Sheri-

states to you in terms that Mr. Hardy

arliament toge-

, wished a committee to be appointed; he

wished an inquiry to be made, and he was

, Yeady, and was to have laid before Mr. Sheri-
" dan, nay he was to have been called before

the House of Commons, and to give an ac-
count there of all he knew relative to that

' business; be state! that their societies did

meet at public-houses; that publicans,
bably thinking their licences would be taken

_ away, would not permit them to meet in their

houses any more; that they had accordingly
met at private houses; that he (Mr. Hardy)
had communicated a list of these houses, and
hadl given Mr. Sheridan all the information in
his power ; that he wished an inquiry might

' be instituted, in order to show to the

ia-
ment and the public what their real’ $iee
was: that he was ready to lay before them all
the papers, all the documents relative to the
prveress of this society. This seems te me
to furnish extremely strong proof that Mr.
Hardy acted bund fide; that he had then no
criminal intent in his mind, nor had any of
those acting with him, because if they had, he
would have withdrawn from such an inquiry ;
instead of that he comes forward publicly, de-
Sires that an inquiry into their conduct may
be institued, and he gave every assistance in
his power for that purpose. .
Eappeass from Mr. Francis’s evidence,
that what Mr. Hardy says has always been
his object, always was so; he and some
other members of this society attended Mr.
Francis, wishing him to pace a petition
to parliament, for annual parliaments and
universal suffrage. Mr. Francis says, Mr.
Hardy struck him, particularly from his de-
ies, as areasonable, quiet man. Mr.
heridan likewise gave that testimony to his
tex: he says he remarked him for his


peaceable and decent deportment ; thet come
ing to him to desire him to present this peti<
tion, he conversed with them upon the sub~
ject; and they said then, what they now sayy
notwithstanding this sent prosecution
against them, that they learned their prin-
ciples from the duke of Richmond’s letter >
that they were convinced by his arguments ;
and I am afraid that they still hold the same
opinions. I hope it is no reflexion upon any.
man, not to entertain these vpinions; for
I do not myself; yet still it is surely am
excuse to such @ man as Mr. Hardy, that he,
holds opinions such as the duke of Rich
mond entertains, and not only entertains,
but has given to the ae as his opinions,
and acted upon himself. They adhered to
their object, Mr. Francis says, of poiversak
suffrage; he stated to them, that that wag
net the usual form of a petition, and they
had better leave it to the House, what sort
of reform should be adopted. They still,
Mr. Francis says, adhered to their object;
but they were ready, if, according to the
forms of the House, it was more respectful,
to leave the whole to the wisdum of tha
House of Commons, what means they should
adopt; they were ready to pregent their
Petition in the general form; but still they
adhered to their principle, that what they
wished for was universal suffrage. Surely
this must show, beyond doubt, that these _
men really thought it would be « good thing
to obtain universal suffrage, and that this
was the object, and the only object which
they i , and boné fide pursued.

But, Gentlemen, those who conduct this
prosecution wish to persuade you that there’
18 more in it tham lies upon the surface;
that these men have not acted honestly;
that they have not acted bond fide; that this
which they have held out as their object, and
this which they have held out as their means
of obtaining that object, are a mere pretext,
and that there is no colour for insisting thet
they are their real opinions.—Let us examine
that a little; let us see what grounds they
had for really entertaining these opinions,
and whether their conduct be not such as
leaves you reason to conclude they are their
real opinions.—The proposition of these
men is this :—That the House of Commons
is corrupt; that that corruption proceeds
from the manner in which the people are
represented in parliament, and from the’
long duration of parliaments; that they
think thisevil might be corrected by annuak
parliaments, and by universal suffrage; they
think the House of Commons will not grant
them this upon their petition, because they
have often refused them ; they think that the
majority of the people (I do not say that
they think right)—but they think the
majority of the people are or may be
with them ; they say, they wish to collect the -
sense of the majority of the people ; they
therefore wish that a convention o delegates

4E

from different parts of the country should be
called, by whom they should first collect what
was the sense of the people by whom they
were delegated ; and if it appears to be what
they contend it is, that it shall then be com-
taunicated to parliament—This it is said is
mere pretext.

Now, let'us examine it’ in its parts.—The
first proposition is, that the House of Com-
fons is corrupt—I do not mean to say that
the House of Commons is corrupt; but I am
examining whether Mr. Hardy, who has

inned his faith upon the duke of Richraond,

as not ground for saying so, and that that
eorruption proceeds from the want ofa proper
representation of the people in the House of
Commons. What ¢oes the duke of Rich-
mond say upon that subject ?—He says, in his
letter to colonel Sharman, ® The lesser reform
has been attempted with every possible ad-
vantage in its favour, not only from the zea~
lous support of the advocates for a more effec-
tual one, but from the assistance of men of
great weight, both in and out of power; but
‘with all temperaments and helps it has failed ;
not one proselyte has been nee from cor-
ruption, nor has the least ray of hope been held
out, from any quarter, that the House of Com-
mons was‘inclined to adopt any other mode
of reform.”—Why, then it is not a suggestion
first of Mr. Hardy and his: friends, that the
House of Commons was corrupt, and that this
was the means of reforming it; his great pro-
totype the duke of Richmond, the man whose
a he has followed, and whose disciple

e is, told: him, in express terms, that the
House of Commons is corrupt, and that that
corruption proceeds from the people not being
oped re preneile in the House of Commons.

he remedy, then, that is to be applied to
this, is, in the opinion of Mr. Hardy and his
friends, annual parliaments and universal
suffrage. Why, what does the duke of Rich-
mond say upon that subject >—-Hle says,

“From every day’s experience to the pre-
sent hour, I am more and more convinced,
that the restoring the right of voting uni-
versally to every man not incapacitated by
nature for want of reason, or by law by the
commission of crimes, together with annual
elections, is the only retorm that can be ef-
fectual and permanent: I am further con-
vinced that it is the only reform that is prac-
ticable.

* © All other plans that are of a palliative na-
ture, have: been found insufficient to interest
and animate the body of the people, from
whose earnestness alone any reform can be
expected.—A long exclusion trom any share in
the legislature of their country, has rendered
the great mass of the people indifferent whe-
ther the monopoly that subsists, continues in
the hands of a more or less extended com-
pany, or whether it is divided by them into
shares of somewhat more or less just propor-
tions; the public feels itself unconcerned in
these contests, except as to the oppressions it


endures, and the exactions it suffers, which it
knows must continue so leng as the peop:
remain deprived of all control over their n-
Presentatives.”

« What I call for,” he says, ‘ is, not coc-
veniency, but right; if it is not a mazim
our constitution, that a British: subject ist
be governed only by laws to which be bs
consented by himself,. or his representa,
we should instantly abandon the error; batf
itis the essential of freedom, founded on the
eternal principles of justice and wisdom, 14
our unalienable birthright, we should mt
hesitate in asserting it. Let us, then, bt
determine to act upon this broad principle of
giving to eyery man his own, and we
immediately get rid of all the perplexitieste
which the narrow notions of Partiality ad
exclusion must ever be subject.”

Now it is objected to Mr. Hardy, that ths
idea of the corruption of the House of Com
Mons; corruption proceeding from sn m-
proper representation there—that this idea of
referming parliament by annual election, 's
all pretext. What foundation is there fr
that, when you have heard from twenty wit
nesses im the cause, that Mr. Hardy has over
and over again said, he forms himself upor
the: duke of Richmond’s plan, which be
wishes to be carried into execution ; that tht
is his only object; and when this, which ke
pretences in all his letters, which appears ©

in fact the object he is pursuing, 3s, it
terms, the reform which the duke ef Rich-
mond by a publication recommends to tte
people to ban ?
hen, gentlemen, we have got this length

—that the corruption of parliament is pots
thought of Mr. Hardy’s—that the cause of
that corruption is net a thought of Mr. Ha-
dy’s—that the means by which that comup-
tion might be remedied is not a thought of
Mr. Hardy's; they are all the thoughts of the
duke of Richmond, supported by these ret
sons which you heard read while his gree
was in court.—I have stated to you what the
immediate means were—annual parliaments,
and universal suffrage—The next thing
be considered is, how that reform was tobe
effected.—Mr. Hardy thinks—but that is ss
to be pretext—that it may be effected, and he
meant to effect it, by a convention of the peo

le, and by collecting the sense of the peope
rom that convention.—What does the dake
of Richmond say upon that subject?—He
says, “ the weight of corruption has

this more gentle’—speaking of a lesser re
form, —“ as it would have defeated sy
more efficacious plan in the same circum:
stances; from that quarter, therefore, I hare
malting to hope—it is from the Trey u
large that I expect any good.” Why, thes,
when such a man as the duke of Richmosd
tells the public that parliament has been pe
tioned so often for this redress that they il
not grant it; when he tells them thet be
still expects this to be granted, and tele

°

 ne


that it is fromthe people at large only.that he
expects it will be obtained, how is this man
at the bar to understand the duke of Rich-
mond?—What was the mildest sense he

, sould put upon his words ?—From the people

; at large the duke of Richmond ex

hopes

aM a at

ts this
reform—he does not expect it from the parlia-
ment—he knows the parliament will not
t it? but he expects it from the people.—

hen the people must have some lawful
means of promoting it.—I think the most ra-
tional, I think the most peaceable; I think
the most constitutional construction that
can be -put upon that expression is,
that it is to be expected from the sense of the
people at large, first collected, and then con-
veyed to the House of Commons—not acting
by force; unquestionably, the duke ef Rich-

‘ mond could never mean that ; but he expect-

ed this refurm from the people at large, be-
cause he hoped that they would declare pub-
licly what their wishes were, and that those
wishes being communicated to the House of
Commons,would produce the reform which he
wished to see effected.

Gentlemen, I think this ie fair reasoning ;
I think this must be the construction which

‘ou will put upon the duke of Richmond's

tter:—It cannot be said that a man possess-
ing so enlightened a mind, and holding sucha
rank in the state, as the noble duke, meant

* by this letter to colonel Sharman, to incite

the people to take up arms against their go-
vernment, and to enforce that which would
otherwise be denied to them. He must be
understood, therefore, to have -expected that
the people at large, by-their opinions being
collected, and those opinions being commu-
nicated to the legislature, would produce that
reform for which be was so zealous au ad-

‘vocate,

: What, then, has deen the conduct of the
prisoner, as testified by every part of the evi-
dence in this cause?—That he uniformly
acted upon the duke of Richmond’s plan;
that he pursued that only which the duke of
Richmond wished to be carried into effect :
that he promoted it by the means by which
the duke of Richmond wished to see it ac-
complished.—Who, then, can say ‘that he
meant any thing farther than the duke of
Richmond meant? Is it not, I will ask you,
possible at least to put upon these acts of the
prisoner the construction I put upon the lan-
guage of the duke of Richmond? Is it not
Possible, upon all these acts, that bis object
should have been for the convention to collect
the sense of the people, and state it to parlia-
ment? J ask you first, is it not possible ?—If
it be possible, and if you find that shat was
the duke of Richmond's plan, and if you finé
that this man has universally declared that
his object was only to do that which the duke
pointed out in his plan, surely you will not
then, for. the sake of fixing guilt upon him,
Presume that he meant more than the duke

of Richmond meant—but rather inclining on | this

the side of innocence—inclining ‘to a man
upon whom guilt is not directly proved, you
will say that he meant what the duke of Rich-
mond did mean—that he meant this conven-
tion should act as the duke of Richmond
meant the people at large should act, by col-
lecting the general opinion, and conveying it,
not by force of arms, but peaceably, to the
House of Commens. :

Gentlemen, it is a principle, I. think, in the
English law, that, when the act-of.a man is
indifferent or doubtful, it should rather be
attributed to an innocent than a guilty motive,
—And I hope that we have not lost sight of
another principle by which English juries
have always been governed ; namely, that if
the act of a man be in itself indifferent, and
there be evidence, some having a tendency to
show it criminal, and some innocent, if the
former does not most clearly overweigh the
latter, humanity will.turn the scale in favour
of innocence,

With respect to this act of calling a con-
vention, it being in its nature an innocent
act, you heard read a protest of several learncd,
peers upon a motion that was made in the
House of Lords during the pressure of the
American waz, when the burthens which that
war produced were felt heavily by the subject.
Lord Shelburne made a motion in the [louse
of Lords, the ultimate object of which was to
decrease those burthens; the immediate ob-
ject was, that a committee should be called,
consisting neither of placemen nor of pen-
sioners, to inquire what unnecessary expenses
arose in the public expenditure—what unne-
cessary places existed — what unnecessary

ensions had been granted —and to inquire
ow that expenditure might be lessened.

After a long debate, the motion was ne-
gatived ; but those who were in the minority,
if they were weighed not by their num-
ber but by their merits, would be called a
majority:—There was at their head the ve-
nerable and learned earl Camden, as great a
constitutional lawyer as this country has
ever seen, and as firm a supporter of its
constitution.—There were many more, some
of whom are now acting in administration.—
The duke of Portland, the duke of Grafton,
lord Fitzwilliam, the duke of Rutland, the
duke of Devanshire, lord Rockingham, lord
Scarborough, and, true to his old principles,
the duke of Richmond; they were in the
minority; the motion was negatived; but
they protested against the negative that was
put upon that motion; they assigned their
reasons to the public—they wished to hand
down to posterity their reasons for thinking
that that committee ought to have been in-
stituted, and that inquiry set on foot ; and the
fourth reason which they assign is this:—

“ We are further impelled to press this
motion, because the object of it has been se-
cunded and called for by a considerable ma-
jority of the people, who are associating for
is purpose, and seem determined to pursue

4 by every legal and constitutional method
that can be devised for its success.”—There
you have lord Camden’s authority, that the
people may legally and constitutionally as-
Sociate for the purpose of obtaining an end
which appears to them publicly benefieial—
“ And however some may affect to be alarmed
as if such associations tended to disturb the
peace, or encroach upon the delegated power
of the other House, we are persuaded it has
No other view but to collect the sense of the
people, and to inform the whole body of their
Tepresentatives what are the sentiments of
the whole body of their constituents.”

Then this learned and noble lord asserts
the collecting the sense of the people at large
to be the object of the associations of the peo-
ple; that the object of those associations is, to
communicate te the whole body of the repre-
sentatives what are the opinions of the whole
body of their constituents.—That was the ob-
ject of the man who stands at your bar; that
‘was the object of all those who acted with
him; they meant to call, not an association
of the whole people, but something less tu-
multuous—a convention of delegates sent by
the people at large, by whose means they
sight collect what were the opinions of tne
whole hody of their constituents, and might,
by the same organ, communicate them to the
whole body of their representatives.— And
if it be asked what farther is to be done if
these petitions are rejected, the best answer
js, that the case cannot be supposed ; for al-
though, upon a few separate petitions, it may
be fairly said that the other House ought not
to be decided by a part only of their consti-
tuents, yet it cannot be presumed they will
act in defiance of the united wishes of the
whole people, or indeed of any great and no-
torious majority.”—Then here I get another
step ;—separate petitions had been rejected;
Separate petitions might be rejected; the
House ot Commons might not feel it ne-
cessary to attend to separate petitions ; but if
@ petition could be got from these general as-
Sociations of the people, such a petition would
be legal and constitutional, and, according to
the opinion of lord Camden, ought to be at-
tended to—ougbt to have so much weight in
his estimation, that it is not to be supposed
that so wise a body as the House of Com-
Mons would not yield to it.

Gentlemen, is that illegal to which lord Cam-
ffen, so great a lawyer, gives such an effect,
when he states, that petitions offered by the

general associations of the people, ought to be
attended toby the House of Commons, and that
it is inconsistent with their wisdom to reject
them?—Doesnot he, by this protest, hold out to
the public, that, when separate petitions are re-
jected, the object of which is thought conducive
to the public good, it is the right of the people

toassuctate for that public good, and, pia as-'
lord

sociated, to present such petitions as
Camden tells them are not likely to be re-
jected}. : 7


* It is admitted that the House of Con.
mons have a power to vote as they think f,
but it is not possible to conceive that so wae
an assembly will ever be rash enough tore
ject such petitions, and by that means cane
this dangerous question to be broached ad
agitated whether they have not broke they
trust? The voice of the people will certainly
be complied with; ministers may, as they seen
to have done in a recent instance, depart
| any man of what he holds, at their pleasur,
for presuming to exercise his undoubted ngt!
of thinking for himself on these and o
public subjects, but it will not be wis a
them to treat these associations with ce.
tempt, or call them by the invidious name a
faction, a name by which the minority of
both Houses of Parliament have been so ir-

uently and s0 falsely calumniated, becas:
the name sd applied, will recoil back ups
themselves, when acting against the gener!
sense of the nation, nor will they be able »
represent these numbers, so respectable a
rank and property, as they did but too succes-
fully the discontented Americans, as a mb
of indigent and seditious incendiaries, becaxe
the people to whom this is addressed, are the
very people that are abused, and every ma
bears within himself the testimony of i
falsehood.” ..

Gentlemen, my reason for bringing forward
this protest to you is, that you may see |
it has been the opinion of great and enligh-
ened men in this country, that associations
of the people for the purpose of obtaining
that which they conceive to be a redress of 3
national grievance, are not only lawful bit
commendable ; for if they were only strictly
lawful, and were not commendable, we s!
not see the names ef such men as we do #
at the bottom of this protest, publicly decar
ing, that, because this appeared to be the
voice of the people collected in their assoc
tions, therefore it was incensistent with tbe
wisdom of the House of Commons to rejed
the prayer of these petitions. a

Now, gentlemen, if this be so—if this man
at the bar has always acted upon the dake of
Richmond’s plan—if the duke of Richmol
has conianily pointed out to him ip all bs
publications (it is not necessary for me © §°
Into more than that which I have stated) tha
there exists this corruption in the state,
may be remedied by these means—that th
people havé a right to act for themselves @
the way I have stated ; if it be the opin
men so eminent as those, whose nsmes Yo
haye heard are at the bottom of this proiesy
, that associations of this sort ought to be %
| tended to, how is the prisoner implicated ia

any guilt charged upon him in this
ment? Recollect the principle whieh I bere
stated, and which cannot, I am sure, F
that if you can attribute his actions to 2
BS Motive, you ought not to ascribe

to a criminal one—I defy any man © SY:
that. there is direct proof, pesoom

that the
 ~


prepared any force for pad ya this conven-
tion ; and then if you find he ries constant}

declared that he followed plans of a dif-
3 ferent nature, if you find that general asso-

ciations for such a purpose are lawful, how
¢an you say, that he who projected only the
calling a convention, for the purpose of par-

' kamentary reform—who states, that it was

. for the purpose of takin:

into consideration

: the proper modes for obtaining a full and
: fair represéntation of the people.—How can

ou presume against the constant tenor of his
ife—against the constant language he held

upon the i a the conduct of that

. man,whose precepts

ehas constantly followed

. —against the doctrine laid down in this pro-
, test, that associations for this purpose are
+ legal and constitutional? How can you pre-

sume against all this, that his conduct was

. Not legal and constitutional, though he

always professed to follow the examples of
men who acted legally and constitutionally ;
though he professes in his resolutions to follow
them only by legal and constitutional means?
How can you presume that he had that ille-
gal intent which the indictment charges him
with, namely, that he called this convention
for the purpose, by force of arms, of deposing
the king, and putting him to death; that
would not be a charitable conclusion — it
would not be a conclusion to which English-
men have ever upon such evidence arrived,
and I am sure therefore that it will not be
yours. °

Let me suppose for a moment, that that
noble person who has given his evidence in
this cause, could descend from his high sta-
tion, and become the advocate of this priso-
ner. What would he have had to say in his
defence? would he not say, “ Look to the
ay of this; it was my plan, he is my dis-
aple, he has followed my doctrine, he has
pend my principles by the means which

pointed out to him; I told the public that
annual parliaments and universal suffrage,
was the only reform to be introduced into
the House of Commons, which would remove
the grievances under which we labour —J
told the public, that they had a right to as-
semble, and to make their voice heard in the
House of Commons; I not only told the
public this at the time when I brought for-
ward my motion, but I left with the public
the reasons which induced me to form this
Opinion, and these reasons have since been
Operating upon the mind of this man at the
bar—his sins, if he has sinned, are upon my
head; if he has been misled, he has been
misled by me, he has pursued the same ob-

ject, by the same means; but (it is said) he’

has used harsh language, he has entered into
Improvident resolutions. Why he may; he
18 an ignorant man; his resolutions may
have been improvident; may have been rash;
may have been illegal; his language may
have been so—but when I have af him to
this; when I gave him the principle; when


his end is the same as mine; when the means
he uses are the same: namely, by the inter-
vention of the Peon 3 a little indiscretion ;
a little violence of language, and even a little
illegality, is to be excused in a man in his
situation.

“ T have high rank in the state; I have the
advantages of great abilities ; t industry ;
education; experience; knowledge; and an
enlightened mind to direct me; I used them
all, endeavouring to lead my judgment to a
true conclusion, upon what was really salutary
to the public upon this subject; they led me
to conclude, that annual parliaments and
universal suffrage, were the only means by
which the public could be saved ; and led me
also to conclude, that the people had a right
to annual parliaments and universal suffrage ;
and that if the House of Commons did net
grant them upon private petitions, that to the
people was the proper appeal, and the people
would then make their own voice heard
the House of Commons; this I told the poor
man ; he learned it from me; he has not my
advan ; with all these advantages I en-
tertained the opinion which this man, who
has none of them, following me entertains;
he has on his side nothing but i ces it
is not wonderful that he should have been |
convinced by the reasons whieh I published,
and which induced me to entertain this opi-
nion of a convention of the people, nothin
on the other side ‘having been published,
which could come into his hand: therefore
surely it is reasonable to expect that you will
presume he has acted boné fide.

“ But he has gone greater lengths than I
have; well, that ma excused in him; he
is an ignorant man, he has not the advantages
Thave; he has not had the advice I might
have to follow; he has met, too, with greater
prsroctions than I ever met with; J had a

rge train of followers in the House of Lords;
the propositions which I brought forward,
were never rejected with disdain end con-
tumely; I had never the provocation that
this man has had from the treatment that he
has received ; I will not inquire whether the.
provocation be well or ill founded, but it is
still provocation which a eommon mind was
likely to be moved by.” . .

Gentlemen, these are the lope which the
duke of Richmond himself, if he could be
placed in my situation, and argue the case of
the prisoner, would urge to you; but if he
felt for a moment that this man’s life was in
danger, his blood would eurdle in his veins;
he would shudder at the mischiefs produced
by his publication, and wish in vain to recall
it; he would implore you upon his knees,
not to find any guilt in Mr, Hardy, that you
would not be ready to find in him; he would
tell yor that the prisoner has done neing
which is not imputable to him, nothing whic!
he would not have done himself; his
principles are the same, his objects the same ;
that the means of attaining these objects

avowed by him, and proved in this cause, are, tention you will pay te his lordship, when te
the same; nota single expression has been| comes to sum up, for distinguishing bow

proved upon Mr. Hardy, tending a different
way, and surely, gentlemen, it is a great ex-
cuse for a man in the situation oflife in which
the prisoner stands, to urge that he followed
the same object which the duke of Richmond
points out by the same means: I say by the
same means, because it is not proved by that
plain direct and manifest proof which the sta-
tute calls for, and which lord Coke says is
tequired, that he has used any other; then
penn me to add that the circumstance of his
ing always avowed an adherence to the
plan of the duke of Richmond, ought to lead
you to a conclusion that in this case he mean
Rot to go beyond it. :

Gentlemen, what I have troubled you with
hitherto, is chiefly upon the general evidence
of the plan that has been laid before you.

Gentlemen, you collected from an argu-
ment which we had in the early part of this
cause, that none of the evidence admitted in
it, which is not brought personally home to
Mr. Hardy, ought at all to affect him, other-
wise than as it it may prove (which was the
object of it) a general conspiracy in the coun-
‘try to call together a convention, which was
to be supported by force against the govern-
ment; with that view nine-tenths of the evi-
dence that has been read was admitted, and
with that view only; and it was stated by the
Court, that Mr. Hardy was not to be affected
by any of that evidence, any farther than he
might be proved afterwards to be engaged in
that plot, and to the extent only that he was
proved to be engaged init; namely, in the
plot of calling together a convention for the
purpose of attaining their end against the go-
vernment, by force of arms, re is proof
enough to show that Mr. Hardy did mean
that a convention should be called; he cer-
tainly did, and I do not dispute it, but the
question for you will be, whether Mr. Hardy,
the individual standing at your bar, did in his
mind intend that that convention should act
by force against the government.

Now, gentlemen, | wish it-were within the
compass of my ability to have separated the
evidence, and to have laid distinctly before
you, what evidence does apply to Mr. Hardy,
upon this point.. I admit that his case re-
fe it. Iadmit that his counsel ought to

lo it; and I have but one excuse for not do-
ing it, which is, that to the reach of my ability,
the thing was impossible; though I have had
the accidental leisure of a Sunday to look into
the papers 5 yet from not having a copy of a
third part of the letters that have been pro-
duced in evidence, except those which are in
the report (and I do not mean to blame any
one thatI have them not) though I endea-
voured to do it. I wasted a considerable pore
tion of my time, and I found it, at last, abso-
lutely impracticable. I must, therefore, leave
itto you. I trust to your recollection, to the
notes which you have taken, and to the at-

much of this affects Mr. Hardy. In my4p-
rehension, none of it goes to show, that m
is mind, there existed a design of effecting s

pert in the parliamentary representatioc,
yy force. .

You observe, gentlemen, that, in the forms
part of my argument, I contended, that thee
existed no such design; if there did, whet
is another fae of my argument, there is 2
colour for fixing any thing, as it seems to me,
‘apon Mr. ly, the prisoner. Gentlemen,
it is in evidence to you, that Mr. Hardy bas
never been without a spy at his elbow for the
last two years, from the year 1792 tll the
time that he was apprehended ; he bas never
‘been at any meeting, he has never been with
any assembly of friends at which there wa
not present some person who has carried
the ears of government every thing that wis
said, by every person, at these meetings. Is
it not singular then, that with the disposition
which these men had to produce a reform (3
I admit they had) that not one single expr
sion, upon any occasion, is proved to bare
dropped from the mouth of Hardy, showing
disrespect either to the King, oy to the Lords?
But I would not rely much upon that :—Isit
not aleo singular, that not even an hasty e-
' pressions nut an accidental word, has ever
\ fallen from him, to show, that it ever was if
his contemplesis to use force for any pu-
pose? And is it possible, that if he had con-
ceived in his mind a design of carrying the

project of that convention by force, walt
as he has been, with spies constantly about
him, some unguarded word should not at some
time or other, have fallen from him, indicating,
that be had entertained such an intention’
You will observe, that though it is 8 pat of
bid evi enes of the crown to show fe Sie
lot, and, for that purpose, they have
jor general avnletins, vas you have another
uestion to try; you are to say, notonly whe
ther there was any such plot; but, if ther
was, whether Hardy was an actor in it,
embraced, in his mind, all its criminal views?
For you are trying his intentions in calling
this convention, whether it was the object o!
his mind, that, when called, it should act by
force? No matter who meant it, if be
not; if that was not the intention of Mr.
Hardy, you cannot find him guilty ; andi it
was his intention, I do think it utterly impo>
sible, that going into the history of his lie
for two years, going into every aet of it, .
tending him at every meeting that be ee
attended, with spies whose ears were one
upon all occasions, it is utterly impossible ad
think, that some expression, some gus!
word, should not have fallen from him sm
ing that this was his intention. No such
is proved to have fallen from him; 00
ression from which it can be presumed,
be entertained such an idea. Is this en
ding to the cofumon course of human «io

Does the hisfory 6f human life furnish you
with a single instance of a man, having a cer-
tain plan in his mind, for two years together,
meeting persons, with whom he is supposed
to have been associated for the purpose of
carrying that plan into execution, conversing
with them upon the subject which would na-
turally lead to it, with the utmost freedom,—
Supposing himself not watched; supposing
himself to be talking with men, in whom he
might repose the most certain confidence; do
you find any instance, in the history of hu-
man nature, that a man the most artful and
wily, through the course of two whole years,
has never in confidence dropt an expression,
showing he entertained that design which
was lurking in his heart? Does the history
ef human nature furnish you with such an
instance? And, if it docs not, surely your
humanity, your good nature will lead you to
say, that it bas not existed, for the first time,
in this unfortunate man at the bar. Gentle-
men, you are trying an act of his mind; you
are trying whether it was Ais intention to
compass this end by force; if it were not,
whether such was the intention of any other
‘ person is immaterial. Then, if he has never
suffered to escape from him an expression,
: feom which that can be collected; if all that
has fallen from his lips, for the last two years,
‘bas been communicated to those who accuse
- him, being, as he supposed himself always to
* be, in company with friends and _confidents,
. when he was in company with spies, surely it
is too hard to say, that he entertained in his
mind, during all this time, a project,fconcern-
ing which he never uttered a syllable, even
- to those with whom it is pretended that he
. conspired ; that is too much for human cre-
dulity to give faith to. ,
If Mr. Hardy were a man of profligate man-
‘Bers and dissipated life; if he were a man
. likely, from the tenor of his conduct, to rush
into a plan of this sort; if I could presume,
from his general habits, that he was disposed
to entertainand to pursue violent objects, by
: Violent means, there might be something in
- this case. But you have heard the character
, that has been given of him; I think I never
heard so universal and complete a character
iven by 90 many persons, of an individual in
is situation, in my life. All sorts of persons
, have been called to you ; his neighbours ; his
, friends; those with whom he fived in inti-
, Macy; those of the same business with him-
self; some his countrymen ; some not; all
, of them, concur in saying, that he isa man of
. the most amiable disposition, and respectable
character; that he is a man of the most peace-
. able mind; that he is the last man in the
, world whom they should ever think capable
of entertaining such a project as is now im-
puted to him.
| ‘The minister whom he attends has been
, called; he not only says, that his conduct in
life has been exemplary, his manners amiable

, 4nd peaceable, but he tells you, that conver- |


sing with him upon political subject, he en-
Seatourel to draw fear him what his object
was, and the means by which he meant to
attain that object; that he always told him,
it was parliamentary reform, upon the duke of
Richmond’s plan, and that the means by
which he meant to obtain that object were
peaceable. You observe, that these witnesses
whom we called to his character, were not all

eople of his way of thinking, but that some
fad differed with him in politics. I believe
that is in evidence. I know, however, the
fact tobe so. They all concurred in saying,
that, during all the time they have known him,
some for twenty years, his masters whom he
served, all concurred in saying, a better cha-
racter never belonged to man.

Gentlemen, this is a case in which, of all
others, a Pane character ought to weigh;
because this is a case in which you are trying
the act of the prisoner’s mind; in which you
are trying, whether he had conspired with
others to pull down this government by torce?
Whether he was ready to take arms in his
own hand, and attack the established powers
of the country? That is the question you are
to try; and, if you find any thing short of
that; if youdo not find that it was the de-
sign of Mr. Hardy to.attack the government
by force, through the means of a convention,
it is impossible you should find him guilty.

Then, gentlemen, surely this character
ought to weigh ;—surely a man of such peace-
able manners as belong to him, ought not
lightly to be presumed capable of such an act;
and when you add, too, that his conduct has
been most diligently scrutinized, for two
years, ina manner which no man could be
aware of; when you find, that they are ac-
quainted with every thought of his mind, that
has found expression by his tongue, and that
no word has ever fallen from him indicating
a criminal intention, it is not too much to ex-
pect you to say, that, whatever other men
may have intended upon this subject, he had
not those views which are imputed to him,
and therefore ought to have your verdict in his
favour. .

Gentlemen, let me remind you again of
what the point is which you have to try ;—it
is, whether Mr. Hardy, at the time he cont
curred in the resolution for calling this cone
vention, did himself personally mean, that the
convention, being called, should act by force
of arms against the government? That is the

joint which you have to try.—Mr. Hardy’slife

as been sifted :—It is not proved, that;
through the whole course of it, conversing
with men upon the subject of this intended
convention, and of the parliamentary reform?
meant to be effected by it, he ever cisipges |
single expression, from which it can be col
lected, that he meant to use force ; if he didi
not mean to use force, he must be acquittefl
of the charge now brought against him.—That-
he did not, I think this evidence goes fully to
prove ; and, therefore, I trust in God that you
will give him your verdict of acquittal.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Mr. Hardy, the
counsel whom you have had assigned to you
at your own request, have hitherto conducted
your defence, examined your witnesses, and
each of them has addressed himself to the
jwry on your behalf: you are alco at full liberty
to speak for yourself, if you wish to do so;
and if you do, this is the proper time for you
to be heard.

Mr. Hardy.—My lord, I am perfectly satis-
fied with the defence my counsel have made
for me; and I apprehend there is no need of

wey saying any more.

Lord Chief’ Justice Eyre—And you do not
wish to add any thing?

Mr. Hasdy —No, my lord.

either on the one side or the other, of any
political circumstances whatever ; and much

stances, or any circumstances beyond the par-
ticular case before the jury, should in any de-
go weigh with them. The trial by jury is

In common and ordinary criminal cass,
beyond the particular case, and beyond te
mischief that may arise from crimes gv
unpunished, in whatever way the verdxts
given, no great inconvenience can result ; ba
in cases which so greatly affect the state a
the charge of high treason does, the safety of
the state itself may be fatally involved ;—ba
it is your duty to diseard even that considen-
tion. You are simply to give your verddt

you stall believe to be the truth of the ca,

discard every other consideration.

Gentlemen, in following my learned friewds,

Poses upon me, but I think thus far appeats
clear, that they have not attempted to invali-
date the truth of any one important faet, but
as far as I am able to judge, the trush of every
important fact stands, in effect, admitted
upon the defence which the prisoner's cut
have made. They have endeavoured
qualify; they have endeavoured to throw
some obloquy upon particular witnesses; bet
I think you will observe, that, upoa the whok,
every attempt of that sort (in some respect,
perhaps, justly founded), but every attemp
of that sort has failed of shaking the mam
great points of the case. On the contrary,
my learned friends, with a great degree of
judgment, have omitted even to touch upon
some of the strong parts of the case. I would
also observe that the facts which have beet
stated by the witnesses who have given
testimony, are facts in general to which greab
numbers were also privy, which might, there
fore, be contradicted by great numbers, if they
had not been truly stated by the witnesses,
and, therefore, you have the strongest ¢
fur presuming that it was impossible by-the
production of any witnesses against them te

'; With respect to some part of what has been

by my learned friends, I really have
thought it an attack upon Mr. Burke, the
duke of Richmond, his majesty’s ministry,

; the constitution itself; rather than a defence

of the prisoner at the bar. All these conside-

,. Tations, it appears to me, ought to be thrown

<a

entirely out of the case. You are merely to
decide upon the evidence before you, and
upon that evidence as it applies to the prisoner.

Conceiving, therefore, that my friends have
not been able materially to shake any of the

.. important facts of the case, I shall very shortly

take a view of the law of the case, and con-
sider it with reference to what appears to me
to be the striking and leading facts. But it is
necessary first to observe, that as the meaning
and intention of the acts imputed to the pri-

" soner are more questioned than the acts them-

selves, it may be important a little to attend
to the evidence as it may appear to impute
that meaning and intent to him, in common
with a great number of other persons. Itdid
not enter into the mind of the attorney-gene-
tal when he opened this case to you, to impute
to the great mass of people concerned in
these transactions any such meaning or intent
as he imputes to the prisoner at the bar. He
conceived, on the contrary, that the proceed-
ings were, generally speaking, a system of
fraud and deception; always professing one
thing, and really meaning another ; confining
the Eamwicdae of their true meaning and in-
tent to a few persons, who were the directors
and the leaders of the whole, who had the
whole business in effect under their manage-
ment, If this were matter of doubt with us
before the cause was opened, we can have no
doubt of it now. It is impossible to doubt
that there was great secrecy in parts of the
transaction, that a few transacted the whole,
and that the rest blindly submitted to what
course they directed.

Gentlemen, the whole cross-examination of | heard

the Sheffield witnesses, and the whole of the
Original examination of the witnesses for the
Prisoner, and their cross-examination, seems
to me to show, that a vast majority of the
persons who were engaged in the transactions
which have been brought before you for dis-
cussion, have been persons who implicitly
Save up their judgment to their leaders. You
will recollect the manner in which Broomhead
described it. He said, “ they listened to their
great orators, as to their guides and directors ;
vee not the vanity to think that they

id form a proper plan of proceeding; they,
therefore, passed a string of resolutions,” as
Broomhead distinctly stated, “ in compliment
to those who drew them UP» believing those
Persons to be men of knowledge, and having
confidence in their judgment.” Some of them
appear, through a perfect inattention, merely
to have done as others did; and Dowling, you
will recollect, in speaking of the transactions
at Chalk-Farm, said, that when the resolu-
tions were read, and speeches made, he was



at such 4 distance he could not hear what
was said, but gave his vote in consequence of
seeing all the rest vote. Some of dem des-
cribed themselves as being totally inattentive,
You will recollect Archibald Hunter, a man
who described himself at last, as having been
a hair-dresser and perfumer ; but who had, as
he represented, forgotten what trade he had
been of before he lived upon his means. He
stated that he heard the resolutions at Chalk-
Farm and the Globe tavern read, but he did
not ¢ote; he took no part in them; and he
said of himself, that this arose merely from
the inattention which pervades his whole con-
duct. I can easily helieve that many other
persons were as inattentive as this man was,
and engaged as he did in such societies as this,
without adverting to consequences. It is in-
deed miserable, that there should be such
men, but more miserable that there should
be persons who take upon them to lead such
men, and to decide for them upon acts which
are, unquestionably, at least of great impor-
tance, not only to those men themselves, but
to every other man who lives in this country.
For inattentive men, like these, might be led
to the most violent measures, without in the
least judging for themselves upon the subject.

Gentlemen, almost every one of the wit- —
nesses who were proiace’ on the part of the
prisoner from the London Corresponding
Society (for I think there is only one from
the Constitutional Society) but almost every
one of the witnesses for the prisoner from the
London Corresponding Society has been of
this description; and the only witness who
was of the Constitutional Society, was Mr.
Wills, the dancing-master, who was a mem-
ber of both societies. He said he was little
acquainted with their proceedings; he never
looked into their books, though it appeared
that the books of the Constitutional ces
constantly lay upon their table; he never
of a secret committee, or a committee
of correspondence, till he read it in the news-
papers, though it has been proved that the
whole business was transacted by the com-
mittee of correspondence, or secret committee,
That committee was not, indeed, originally
named a secret committee, but it got that
name, as a nick name, from all its proceed-
ings being secret; and finally it got that
name from its very members. Upon the
whole of the evidence of Wills, you must be
persuaded that he was nota man whom they
would have sought as a member of either of
the societies from any other motive, than that
he appeared very willing tu part with his
money, and probably was in better circum-
stances than most of them were.

The producing witnesses of this kind is a
strong circumstance; because if they had
meant that the transactions of the London
Sorespons ing Society should be openly ex-
amined; if they had thought the transactions
of that society could bear the face of open day,
would they not have brought the acting men,

selves, an application to a magistrate would

_ application, He never told them, “If you
are afraid of having your houses burnt, or of
being insulted in any way, apply to a magis-
trate for protection.” No; he rather chose
, tomake an impression upon their minds by
what had passed from the Church and King
party. I can easily conceive, that a violent
party might have done very improper things,
and very blameable; but use is made of that
to induce these men to arm themselves; and
. that idea being once entertained, you can
easily conceive to what length it might be car-
nied, particularly when you recollect what
_ dropped from one of the witnesses for the pri-

soner—that there was no difficulty whatever,
when the plan was once settled, of having ten
thousand pikes forged at Slicfheld, in one day;
therefore, all that was wanted was, to have
. the plan settled ; that they should have some

pikes, so that they might know what sort of
thing to order ; that the price, which is a very
eheap one, should be fixed, and the other little:
circumstances arranged, of the length of the
pole, and the materials of which it was to be
made; and then a very few days would have
armed a very large body of men, at Sheffiel,
with these pikes; and a body, so armed, might
have been used in the manner which you will
recollect Yorke stated to Broomhead, and in
which those who governed them were well
disposed to use them; namely, that rather
than be trampled upon, in the way in which
they were supposed to be trampled upon, he
would have gone at their head, to London.
A body of ten thousand men, with pikes, thus
led, might have been like the Marsellois you
have so often heard of, who have acted at
Paris, ia a manner not the most agreeable to
humanity.

Gentlemen, in consequence of this plan of
fraud, and of this credulity, you will remem-
ber, that motions were made on purpose to
be rejected. That has been clearly proved in
the transactions at Sheffield. The motion to
petition parliament was made, unquestionably,
for the simple and only purpose of being re-
jected, in order to its being the foundation of
the subsequent proceedings. Domen mean to
act fairly and honestly, who act in that way?
And did the body of people, who attended
upon that occasion, know, that that was a
contrivance? The evidence has distinctl
shown to you, that they did not know that it
was acontrivance. When these men publish-
ed to the world, in the printed proceedings of
what passed at Sheffield, that a motion had
been made for a petition to parliament, and
had been rejected, and so on, was it not held
out to the world as a fair bond fide proceeding?
That the motion had been made, and rejected,

there were reasons for rejecting it?
Whereas, in truth, and in no such dis-


cussion ever took place; it was -determined
on before hand ; it was made for the purpose
of being rejected; and then, being rejected,
other proceedings were directly to follow. I
think, also, there can be little room to doubt,
though there is not direct proof of it, that the
proceedings at Shetlicld were printed before
the meeting was held. They were printed,
certainly, according to the account which
Broomhead gave, as nearly as possible to the
time ; so that they must have been prepared
Jor printing at least before the meeting was
actually held.

The proceedings at the Globe-tavern, you
recollect, were printed, to be delivered on the
eighteenth; whereas the meeting was not
held till the twentieth. So it was determined
before-hand, that certain resolutions should be
passed ; that certain things should be done;
the whole proceedings which actually passed
at the Globe-tavern, were all contrived before
hand, by a knot of people; and, being so con-
trived, an account of them, describing them
as having passed, was put into the hands of
the printer; and but for an accident, but for
the prisoner’s happening to come in the way,
the account would have been distributed be-
fore the proceedings were had; for the prin-
ter brought two hundred copies to the Globe-
tavern, and he was told to carry them back
again, except a few, which were taken per-
haps, to be delivered to a few confidential
friends.

Gentlemen, you will recollect, also, that the
account of the proceedings, at the meeting at
Chalk Farm, appeared very early. It does not
clearly appear, that the proceedings were
Printed before hand; but they must have
.been all arranged before the meeting actually
took place.

It seems to me, therefore, gentlemen, that
a system has been pursued, which absolves a
great majority of the persons, although cer-
tainly very blameable in many transactions in
which they have been engaged, from a great
part of the highly criminal intent imputed to
the prisoner. They acted carelessly; they
acted incautiously ; they gave themselves up
to their leaders—but they acted without any
eal distinct views of what they were doing ;
and they acted (many of them) under delu-
sion, under false impressions. One of the
witnesses, from Sheffield, I recollect, who was
examined this morning (I have unfortunately
mislaid the minutes I took of his evidence)
but one of them, I recollect, said, that his ob-
ject solely was, to have things as they were at
the Revolution, in 1688; that glorious event,
as he described i.—Now, gentlemen, let me
call to your minds what change has been
made in the constitution of the House of
Commons, since. the Revolution in 1683-—
soon after the Revolution the triennial bill
passed, and the septennial act has since follow-
ed, That is the sole and only change, since
the Revolution, in the House of Commons,
except several bills which have had for their

object to exclude from the House of Commons,
persons holding particular places under the
crown, and persons having offices in the col-
lection of the revenue, which might be consi-
dered as making them dependant; so that
the alteration in the House of Commons since
the year 1688, must be considered as rather
for the benefit of the people, than disadvan-
tageous to them; and therefore it is clear that
the statement which had been made to this
Man on the subject, was a mere delusion
upon his senses; it is impossible that the
facts should have been stated to him in such
@ manner as to make him fairly comprehend
them. And this was not theenly man who
was deceived upon this subject ; for I think I
remember another witness who said he was
for restoring the constitution, as it was in
1688.

Gentlemen, the great majority being thus
absolved from the high guilt imputable to the
few, the few are involved in a guilt of still
deeper die ; not only the guilt which arises
from the acts which they have committed,
but the guilt which arises from their having
induced others to be participators in those
acts; who did not know, or who did not at-
tend to what they were about; or who were
misled, deceived, and imposed upon, by those
who took the lead in these societies. Among
these few, the evidence has certainly deeply
implicated the prisoner at the bar. He can-
not excuse himself as Broomhead, Dowling,
Hunter, Wills, and other men of that descrip-
tion, have done. He cannot say he was little
acquainted withthe proceedings of the society ;
that he toook no part; that he voted resolu-
tions which he never heard. He cannot

say that he never heard of the Committee.

of Correspondence, of the Secret Committee.
The very name—a Secret Committee—shows
that danger was understood to be in their
measures ; even the names of the members
of this committee were finally unknown to
the rest of the society; and by this contriv-
ance, that the existing committee should be
dissolved, but should name their successors
without making the names of their successors
known to the rest of the society. The conse-
pee was, that a body was created, such as
believe never was permitted to exist in the
pat of any state.—When this business
rst came within my notice, I looked into the
constitutions of those states which have been
supposed to have provisions of this kind, of the
most extraordinary nature ; and I believe the
Republic of Venice is considered as having
the most extraordinary. They have no pro-
vision so tyrannical in its nature, or which
tight lead to such dreadful consequences, as
this Committee of Secrecy, the very names of
whose members are unknown.
So that this London Corresponding Society,
a little state within the state; for such it is,
and that is the danger of it, that it isa state
within the great state, which is always a dan-
gerous thing to the community ; this London


(117s

Corresponding Society was given up to th
most despotic dominion that was ever exerci
ed upon men; a dominion over their minds
beyond all example; for they were led »
whatever measure their secret committee, con-
sisting of persons whose very names they did
not know, might think proper to adopt; and
that upon peer of which the rest of the
society could have no opportunity of judging.
Gentlemen, the very existence of that »-
cret committee was not only in itself danger
ous, as it tended to blind their followers, while
they were leading them to the brink of every
thing terrible before they knew where thy
were, but it shows that the dispositions aut
intentions of those who formed it, were du
erous beyond a possibility of doubt. Fw
Bow can it enter into the heart of man to co
ceive that their measures were such as ther
preted them to be; a fair, an open, and
onest attempt to remove what they cons-
dered to be an abuse—how could they cor
ceive it was necessary for that purpose to form
such ar institution as that which J have stal-
ed toyou?—such a proceeding needs nos
crecy; it might have been fairly and opealy
avowed, as it has been fairly and opealy
avowed. For, gentlemen, in this country 9

the manner in which they are circulated, and

to disturb the quiet of the state, unquestio

if a society may be formed in a state, ¥

admits of governments being wisely forme

the public opinion, any government whatere!

entlemen, you will recollect that eve ©
the French Revolution, of which we bir?


heard so much; in the constitution formed
by the National Assembly of 1791, that as-

- sembly did not conceive it possible for a state

to exist unless some restraint was imposed
upon the extravagance of opinions, when in

. their circulation they aimed at the destruction

of the state. That assembly also conceived
thata state could not exist with such a com-
bination of people in the form of clubs, as ap-
pears in this case to have been established in
this country; and one of the last legacies
which they left to their successors, as the at-
torney general observed, was a decree (unfor-
tunately never executed) tending to prevent
the dangerous effect of clubs by association,

_afbliation, and delegation, which have ever

since continued to disturb that country.
Gentlemen, you will find that in the execu-
tion of this plan, which I cannot avoid calling

a plan of art, of deception, and of mischief,

whatever higher name may be attributed to
it, the prisoner at the bar must necessarily

have been concerned. For he was the person

produced to you; so that (Mr. Horne Tooke
a member of the London Corres-
ciety) Mr. Hardy must have acted
in communication with him, and probably, from
every thing that appears, in many instances
without any communication whatever with the
rest of the society. The prisoner’s connexion
with Margarot and Skirving, is also myste-


rious; and it is perfectly plain that he did not
communicate to the delegates all that
between him and Margarot and Skirving ;—
you will recollect that the first plan of gend-
ing delegates to the convention at Edinburgh,
which afterwards assumed the title of the Bri-
tish Convention, originated in a correspon-
dence between the prisoner and Skirving,
which was expressly communicated only to
Margarot. It appears by Hardy's letter to
Skirving of the 5th of October 1793, that
Skirving had written to Hardy privately, about
sending these delegates; that Hardy had com-
municated it to Margarot; that they wished
it to be officially communicated to the suciety ;
and the prisoner uses these words, “ without
any ways mentioning that you have written
to me privately.”

Gentlemen, here you see was a contrivance
to induce the sending delegates from this
country to the convention which was intended
to be assembled at Edinburgh; and by whom
is the contrivance? I do not mean to’ say,
that the persons I am going to name, are
the people that were concerned in it; but they
are all whose names appear in this particular
transaction; Skirving, Hardy, and Margarot ;
no other person appears at all privy to the
original idea;—on the 5th of October 1793,
Hardy writes to Skirving—From that letter it
appears, that there had been a private corres-
pondence between him and Skirving upon
this subject; that this had been communi.
cated only to Margarot; and that Mi
and Hardy, consulting together, determined
that it would be proper, that an official letter
should be written upon the subject, which
Hardy might be able to show to the delegates.
If in that official letter Skirving had stated
the fact, that there had been a private corres-
pondence between himself and the [poner
upon the subject, the delegates would have
said, “ where is that correspondence? we
have never heard of it before.” Therefore the
prisoner tells Skirving, do this “ without any
ways mentioning that you have written to me
privately.” Is it not evident from this letter,
that the previous correspondence was con-
cealed from the rest of the society, from the
committee of delegates, even from the .com-
mittee of Secrecy, as well as the body of the
society? that all this was a contrivance be-
tween Skirving, Hardy, and Margarot, for the
purpose of inducing the society to send dele-
gates to this convention? Skirving then sends
up a letter, in a great hurry, saying there was
No time to be lost. This the Corresponding
Society is to communicate to the Constitu-
tional Society, and delegates are chosen, and
are sent to Edinburgh.—Probably this was a
sudden thought; and I think, when I come
to investigate the transaction more particu-
larly, you will be of opinion that it was so,
But it demonstrates that the prisoner had the
contrivance of all the transactions, and parti-
cularly of this transaction.

Gentlemen, if you advert to the correspon-


(19

dence which took place after Margarot and) king in the execution of his authority, ad

Gerrald went to Edinburgh, you will see that
the correspondence between the prisoner and
them became partly private, and partly of an
official nature; and dees is one letter, of the
8th of December, 1795, in which Margarot
says to Hardy, “ You may consider this as a
private letter; but you may read such parts
of it as you may think proper, to any member
of the society, especially where it may be pro-
ductive of good.”——Gentlemen, this letter
shows that Margarot had a perfect confidence
in the prisoner; that he relied upon him in
the whole transaction, and that he left it to
his discretion to produce to the rest of the
society, such parts of this letter as he should
think proper to communicate.

Gentlemen, there are several other letters,
with which I will not trouble you, in which it
appears that the same sort of secrecy was kept
up; and on the 17th of April, 1794, there is
a letter from Margarot to Hardy, in which he
expressly tells him, “ Show this to nobody.”
‘all these circumstances seem to make it im-
possible to consider Mr. Lardy, either as one
who could be deceived, or as inattentive, or
ignorant. He must be ranked in the number
of those persons who led the society, and as
one of the most active.

. Gentlemen, considering him in this light,
and conceiving, therefore, that the evidence
presses as strongy against him as against any
other man, I shall endeavour to investigate,
first of all, the law upon the subject, and then
consider how that law applies to the facts;
and I shall go pretty much at large into the
law, in eoumegrace of what passed from my
learned friend who led the defence for the

risoner, and who entered pretty much at

rge upon the subject; the gentleman who
followed him having also in some degree ad-
dressed you upon it. .

Gentleinen, the indictment is framed upon
the statute of the 25th Edward 3rd, upon
which you have heard a great deal. The pri-
soner is charged with high treason in com-
passing the death of the king; and you have

n told that the law makes the mere intent,
followed by any act done in pursuance of that
intent amount to the crime of high treason.
Therefore the indictment states various acts
to have been done by the prisoner, in pursu-
ance of the alleged intent. The first of these
is a conspiracy to procure a convention to be
assembled to subvert the legislature, and
depose the king. Evidence has been given of
various matters which I am to contend prove
this fact, and several other facts charged in
the indictment as overt acts; such as compos-
ing and publishing various books and papers,
containing incitements to send delegates to
the convention—consulting about assembling
such convention—agrecing upon the appoint-
ment of a committee for that purpose.—
These are charges which relate to the as-
sembling the convention.—There is a charge
of procuring arms, to oppose with force the

foreibly to alter the legislature, and

the king.—There is another charge of aco
spiracy to levy war—another of a consping
to alter the goveramentand depose the king—
and others which are nearly of the sam
effect, intended to meet all possible ass
which might arise on the evidence which has
been laid before you.—It is for you to judg,
from that evidence, whether the prisonerit
the bar, and those with whom it is alleged he
conspired, had formed any design which
would render their minds guilty within the
meaning of the law; and whether he had &
monstrated this criminal intent by any act,
acts, in furtherance of it, so as to bring him
within the penalty of the law. And, genie
men, you must likewise consider, whether tk
acts so done, have been proved as the law re.
quires; that is, one act by two witnesses, @
two acts, each by one witness; and whether
you give credit to the evidence.

With respect to the formality of the ev
dence, as no objection has been taken wit,
(and no objection, I apprehend, could be takea
to it), I shall not enter into that subject; and
I conceive that the only subject for your cam
sideration now is, how far you are to gre
credit to the evidence adduced, and hov far
that evidence, if credited, gives suticiest
proof of the charge contained in the indict
ment. .

Gentlemen, with respect to the question of
law in the construction of this statute of the
25th Edward Srd, I venture to lay it downt
you as clear law, that forming a design to take
any measure by which, if pursued, the kings
life may be in danger, and taking any step 0
pursuance of that design, brings the man who
Is guilty of forming that design and
that step, within the provisions of the statute;
and that it is perfectly immaterial whether the
acts proposed to be done, or the measures
taken, were or were not equal to the purpose.
It is sufficient that the intent was conceve,
and the act done in pursuance of that intent

Gentlemen, before the statute of the 25th
Edward 8rd, (as has been repeatedly stated

ou) there was considerable uncertainty in
law of treason. Many acts were deemed tre
son, which were certainly merely contempts
of the king’s authority; and in consequence,
the legislature was, in the 25th Edward sr,
called upon to define treasons. In doing this,
the legislature must have considered, if w
suppose the persons who made this law t0
have had the sense and discretion which ord
narily belongs to men in that situation,
they have been generally considered as mel
possessed of great wisdom — indeed it is §
general observation upon the transactions df
the reign of Edward the Srd, particulary
with respect to law prosaing, that they
were clear, plain, and unembarrassed, &
dently the work of very superior mec—t
must necessarily have oc to them, thst
it was proper for them to consider, whet

making the law of treason, what necessity |
there was for providing the law of treason as
a distinct code.—The necessity is clear and |
plain:—An association of people, forming a |
state, must have some form of government '
by which the whole body must be submitted
to some power. That power is difterently
constituted in different governments; but in
every government it must of necessity be
sovereign, Whatever that power is, it must
act for the whole body, it must represent the
whole body, and the act of that sovereign

wer must, in the government of that state,
e taken to be the will of the whole. A state
cannot exist without such sovereign power;
it is the great bond which binds the whole
‘ together, and makes it really a state (for,

without such 2 power to control, as well as to
direct the actions of all individuals in the
' state, they never could act as one body, and
' asa state), thus giving to the whole body the
unity which belongs to one person. The con-
Sequence is, that any attempt to destroy the
constitution of the power so established, is
Necessarily an attempt to destroy the very ;
purpose of the association by which the state
1s formed, and consequently to subvert the
State itself; for the constitution of the sove-
Teign power is an essential part of the agrec-
ment, or the compact, or whatever you will
call it, upon which the people are united
together in one association.

Gentlemen, it is the duty, therefore, of
every person who is subject to the sovereign
power of a state so constituted, to support, to
the utmost of his ability, that power, as the
necessary bond of the whole state; and his
acting contrary to that duty is treachery to
the state itself, and his crime is denominated |
treason. — Gentlemen, the true foundation,
therefore, of the law of treason, as a distinct
code, is the necessity of providing for the
safety of the state itself, in the constitution of
its sovereign power: as the principal object
of the ordinary criminal law is the personal
security and particular enjoyments of the
subjects of the state as individuals. It has
therefore become necessary, in all countries,
to make a distinction between those acts
which put in hazard the sovercign power of the
state, and those which, though they may be
contrary to the provisions of the laws, are
mercly contempts of the authority of that
sovereign power to which the framing and
execution of the laws is intrusted, and do not
immediately put in hazard the constitution of
the sovereign power, and therefore the exis-
tence of the state itself; or, if they do in some
degree affect the safety of the state, are not
considered as so dangerous as.to require the \
severe coercion of the law of treason. As, for
instance, libels, and publications of that kind,
though they tend to affect the safety of the
state, have never been considered as of that
dangerous description, when standing alone.

hen, therefore, the legislature, in the 25th
of Edward Srd, was called upon to de-


fine treason, it was necessary to consider what
was the degree of treachery to the state which
the satety of the state required should be
pmines with the high penalties annexed by
aw to the crime of treason.—For, previous
to Edward Srd’s time, the crime of trea-
son was acrime known to the law, and its
unishment was defined. The defect in the
law was, that the crime itself was not so
clearly defined as the safety of the subject re-
uired; and therefore the law was made for
the safety of the subject, that those acts
which were notin so great a degree dangerous

, to the state, should not be so penal.

In the exccution of the duty which the le-
islature were called upon to discharge, they
declared that the penalties of high treason
should attach upon those who were found
guilty of compassing the death of the king,
and particular persons of his family; of levy-
ing war within his realm ; of adhering to tl
king’s enemies, in his realm, or elsewhere ;
of counterfeiting the king’s great and privy
seal, and other acts of less importance.—At
the head of this definition, is the compassin
and imagining the death of the king; suc
conipesing and imagining, or purpose of the
mind, being manifested by some overt act.—
That is the language of our law.—Upon the
construction of this law I must confess that
hitherto no sort of doubt has occurred to my
mind. Ithas been attempted by the counsel
for the prisoner to raise a doubt upon it, and
particularly by the learned gentleman who is
the leading counsel for the prisoner.—It
seemed to me (and, notwithstanding the ex-
planation which he thouglit proper to give, it
still seems to me) that, in so doing, he con-
tradicted that assertion which unquestionably
he made in the character of an advocate in
lord George Gordon’s case, that, ‘¢ The plain,
unextended letter of this act of Edward srd
was thought to be a sufficient protection to the
person and honour of the sovereign, and an
adequate security for the laws committed to
his execution.”—Speaking of the statute as
consisting of different and distinct members,
he adds, “ I shall mention only two of the
number, the other not being in the remotest
degree applicable to the present accusation,
To compass or imagine the death of the king ;
such imagination, or purpose of the mind,
visible only to its great Author, being mani-
fested by some open act ; an institution obvi-
ously directed, not only to the sccurity of his
natural person, but to the stability of the go-
vernment; the life of the prince being so ine
terwoven with the constitution of the state,
that an attempt to destroy the one, is justly
held to be a rebellious conspiracy against the
other,”’*
There I make use of the words of my learned
friend; and [am sure, whenever I make use
of his words, 1 cannot make use of better.—

 ’


What is the meaning of these words ?—There
cannot be any other than this; that a conspi-
racy against the life of the prince is a conspi-
racy against the constitution of the state, and
a conspiracy against the constitution of the
state is a conspiracy against the life of the
prince; the life ofthe prince being so inter-
woven with the constitution of the state, that
an attempt to destroy the one is justly
held to be a rebellious conspiracy against the
other.—The provision is not with a particu-
lar view to the distinct person of the man,
though it is intended to preserve great rever-
ence to whoever is upon the throne of the
country, but it is because he is the king; but
can it be supposed, that when the legislature
was making a law upon this subject, for
the express purpose of defining those crimes
which should be deemed treason, it should
have overlooked that sort of provision which
was necessary for the preservation of the con-
stitution of the state itself; that the law
should so have remained until thisday, and that
it should be necessary, in the language of my
learned friend, to resort to parliament, for an
- act to be made upon the subject ?

Gentlemen, it is absurd to suppose, that if

there really had existed this defect in the law
from the 25th Edward 3rd, till this time, that
the defect should not have been sie,
But it never yet has been understood that
there did exist a defect in the law. It has

been always understood that the provision of

the law was adequate to its 3 that it
did sufficiently protect the state ; that it has
in all times, and in all instances, proved suffi-
cient; and, therefore, the legislature has
never (with this view) thought of making any
farther provision upon the subject.

Gentlemen, when it is considered what is
the nature of the government of this country,
there cannot be 2 doubt upon the subject.
For, in truth, the person of the king in name,
is the state itself. All the powers of the state,
legislative and executive, are nominally in
him. Notreally, because the king can make
no law but by the advice, and with the assent
of the Lords and Commons in parliament.
He can execute no law but by his judges and
other ministers of justice, according to a
formed and regular establishment. He really
does nothing, but he nominally does eve

ing. The consequence is, that he is, to all
intents and purposes, the sole representative
of the state; and in his name every act is
done. Therefore, when the security of his
person was provided for, and the principle
was established that that person was so intes-
woven with the state itself, that they could
not be separated, it necessarily followed
thatthe security of the constitution of the
state was provided for, in providing for the
protection of his person; the sovereign power
of the state never could be attacked, without
: attack likewise upon the person of the

ing.
Gentlemen, it is impossible, therefore, as it


seems to me, to doubt that any altempt to
subvert the constitution of the soverim
power in this count
to depose the king from that character whid
he holds in the constitution of the soverig

[1st

is, in effect, an atten:

power by law established; and it has bea

constantly held since the passing of that se
tute uf the 25th Edward 3rd, that any attempt
to depose the kia
tempt against his life, under whatever pretene

necessarily involves an at-

it may be coloured, and whether the intentxa

be wholly to depose, and to put another in bs

place, or to destroy monarchy itself: o
merely to take from the king his sovereign
authority temporarily, for some certain par-
poses, such an attempt has been always
to be treason. .
Gentlemen, I cannot doubt of this, and ifit
should be necessary, I am persuaded my lot,
and all the judges upon the bench, will oo
firm whatI say. I confess I should have bea
astonished to hear this doubted, if in the pre

sent age I could be astonished at a |

but it is the temper of the times to hold cu
to the world that every thing which has bea
revered for ages, is now no longer to bem
vered; that the reason of man is become
more powerful than it was in former times;
and upon every subject new lights are to break
in upon his mind; he is to be a new creature,
no longer to be governed by the wisdom o
former times, but to proceed entirely upon te
theory of his own conceptions. __
Gentlemen, when my learned friend argued
this point, he app to me to feel that be
was so struggling with authority, that be di
not know how to manage the subject; sx
poses to be bound by those authorities,
e at the same time prefty broadly im!
an inclination to put them all aside. Yoo
must recollect, however, that he did this, not
simply in contradiction to the decisions
courts of justice, but in truth, in contradiction
to the decision of parliament itself; to the de
cision of parliament in making laws, and
the decision of parliament, sitting in its
cial capacity, The ground upon which py
learned friend has attempted to put his
ment is, that the intent is the gist of th
crime; and that when a man does an act D
fulfilment of an intention, he must first bare
conceived the intention. Now, gentlemen,
by that is meant that he must have formed 8
distinct and clear purpose to do the particular
act, nothing can possibly be more mistakes;
not only in the case of treason, but in evey
other case whatever. If a man shoots at 4.
with anintent to kill him, and kills B. whoo
he has no intention whatever of killing, yet
is guilty of killing B. with malice aforethoust
So if a man lays poison for A. and B. takes!t;
anda variety of other instances there sre 2
which it is perfectly clear that a man has beea
deemed guilty of a crime, which was the yo
sequence of his act, although be had 50 ra
tinct preconceived intent at the time, ert
act should produce all the :
have followedit.

Gentlemen, in commenting upon this sta-
tute of the 25th Edward 3rd, my learned
friend cited from lord Hale's: Pleas of the
Crown several passages. Page 80 was, I
think, the first that he cited, where lord Hale
says— accruaching royal power was a usual
charge of high treason anciently, though a
wy uncertain charge, that no man could
well tell what it was, nor what defence to
make to it.” And again in page 82, he says
—* before the statute of the 25th Edward
Srd, almost every offence that was, or seemed
to be a breach of the faith and allegiance due
to the king, was by construction, and conse-
quence, and interpretation, raised into the
offence of high treason.” For what
these passages were quoted by my learned
friend 1 am at a loss to guess. They seem to
tme clearly to show, and were considered by
Jord Hale as clearly showing, what was the
‘tree intent of the statute of the 25th Edward
Srd, that is, that such acts as did not tend in
abeir consequences, te endanger the life of
the ag altbough they might be deemed in
fome degree accroachments of royul power,
or might seem to be breaches of faith and al-
Jegiance to the king, yet should not be
deemed high treason. You will observe these
are the two articles which he specifies in the
two passages I have mentioned, and which
before the 25th Edward Srd were raised into
tthe offence of high treason. The object of
the statute was, that such offences as were
mot found in their consequences to endanger
the life of the king, should not be deemed
high treason, except (for in this the statute
snakes exceptions), except that it makes some
acts which im some degree are accroachmeats
of royal power, or breaches of faith and alle-
giance to the king, though they do mot tend
an their consequences to endanger the fife of
the king, high treasun. What are these acts?
‘One is levying war within the realm. Now,

ying war within the realm, in the sense in
which these words have been constantly un-
@erstood, and in which it is clear from the
swhole of the statute, that the words ought to
‘De understood, may be a sort of levying war
by way of resisting the king’s authority, in
«ircumstances which have no view whatever
to the destruction of the government of the
king, but merely opposing his authority. In
the particular instance of adhering to the
king's enemies, the act may not have even a
Temute tendency to affect the life of the king;
and yet it is declared to be high treason.
And so the other articles ; counterfeiting the
king’s great or privy seal, or his money, &c.
it is clear they could bave no possible view
‘te the endangering the person of the king.
All these acts aight seem to be in breach of
faith and allegiance to the king, or coming
under the other head of accroachment of
eeyal power. Counterfeiting the king’s seal
might be ae & acctoschunent of royal
power; that is, takine u t rson who



does the act, a certain accroachment of royal
power ; but could not by any means whatever
affect the | pees of the king, and the means
used could not in any degree put the king’s
life in hazard. The other two, levying war,
and adhering to the king’s enemies, might or
might not put the king’s life in |) 0
cording to circumstances; and what has
been the consequence? If war is levied, or
a man adheres to the king’s enemies, under
such circumstances as cannot possibly affect
the lite of the king, the person guilty can
only be indicted upon those clauses of the
statute which make levying war, or adhering
to the king’s enemies, treason; but if be
levy war under such circumstances as may
affect the life of the king, he may be indicted
upon the first of the statute for com-
passing the death of the king, and the levy-
ing war may be given in evidence as an overt
act of that compassing. If the object of that
war is such, that it may endanger the life of
the king, a conspiracy to levy it is unques-
tionably cen treason, although the act speaks
simply of levying war. And, therefore, a
distinction has prevailed im the construction
of the law, and the actual levying of war is
Decessary to constitute the crime of high
treason under circumstances that can have
No tendency to touch the life of the king;
but if the object is, to destroy the sovereign
power, or to depose the king from the exercise
of that sovereign power, or restrain him in
apy manner in the exercise of it, a mere con-
spiracy to levy war for such purposes, is high
treason within the first branch of the statute.
Another passage was cited by the learned
counsel from Hale; it is in page 110, in
which he states and which seems to me
to be directly to the point for which I
have stated it, that “a conspiracy

to depose the king, and manifesting this
by some overt act, is an overt-act to prove
the compassing the death of the king,
within this act of 25th Edward 3rd,” and in
page 111, he says, “ compassing to depose
the king is an evidence, or overt-act within
the meaning of the 25th Edward 3rd.” He
refers to lord Coke’s Institutes, where lord
Coke says—“ As if divers do conspire the
death of the king, and the manner how, and
thereupon provide weapons, powder, poison,
array, harness, send lettcrs, é&c. or the like,
for execution of the conspiracy ; also prepara-
tion by some overt-act to depose the king, or
take the king by force and strong hand, and
to imprison him uutil be hath yielded to cer-
tain demands ; this is a sufficient overt-act to
prove the cormpasning and imagination of the
death of the king. For this, upon the mat-
ter, is to make the king a subject, and to
despoil him of his kingly office of royal go-
vernment ; and so it was resolved by all the
judges in England in 1 James 1st, in lord
Cobham’s case.” And so it had been resolved
by ue judges in 43 Elizabeth, in the case of

4

the carls of Essex and Southampton.” And
he adds that it had so fallen out in several
other cases to which he refers; particularly
the cases of Edward 2nd, Richard 2nd, Henry
6th, and Edward 5th, and other unfortunate
kings who had reigned in this country, and
who lost their lives by such conspiracies,
The same doctrine, with the sme comment
upon it, is also stated by lord Hale, with re-
ference to the same cases; and sir William
Blackstone, in his Commentary, considers
these points as settled law.

Perhaps nothing tends more clearly to il-
lustrate a point of law, especially to persons
who are not in the habits of considering
points of law, than the very terms of a case
which has actually happened; and in that
view I will state to you the proceedings upon
the trial of sir Christopher Blunt, and other per -
sons who were indicted with him, in 43 Eli-
zabeth, for being concerned in that transac-
tion of my lord Essex, which I think was
-mentioned by Mr. Gibbs. Upon the arraign-
ment of sir Christopher Blunt and sir John
‘Davis, who were indicted for high treason, in
compassing the death of the queen, they con-
fessed that their design was, to come to the
queen with so strong a force that they might
Not be resisted, and to require of her divers
conditions and alterations of government.
This they confessed. Nevertheless they in-
tended no personal harm to the queen her-
self; and that was the reason why they could
not confess the whole indictment, because
‘the indictment charged that they intended
and compassed the death and destruction of
the queen. Lord chief justice Popham told
them—“ whenever the subject rebelleth, or
riseth in a forcible manner to over-rule the
royal will and power of the king, the wisdom
and foresight of the laws of this land maketh
this construction of his actions, that he in-
tendeth to deprive the king both of crown
and life ;—for the Jaw judgeth not of the fact
by the intent, but of the intent by the fact.”

‘0 which the queen’s counsel added ; “ this
construction is no mystery or quiddity of
law, but an infallible conclusion warranted
by reason and experience; for the crown is
not a garland, or mere outward ornament,
but consists of pre-eminence and power;
and, therefore, when the subject will take
-upon him to give law to the king, and to
“make the sovereign and commanding power
become subject and commanded, such subject
layeth hold on the crown, and taketh the
sword out of the king’s hand. The crown is
so fastened on the king’s head, that it cannot
be pulled off, but head and lite will follow, as
all examples, both at home and abroad, do
manifest. Therefore when their words tes-
tify one thing, and their deeds another, they
‘are like the declaration of the conspirators
with Cataline, protesting their only object



[1188

was their own security, that they sought no-

thing but just laws, and that liberty which -

no man would lose but with life. But ad-
mitting that the protestation of the prisoners
was so far true, that they had not at that time
in their minds a formed and distinct cogita-
tion to have destroyed the queen’s person,
yet there is nothing more mutable than the
mind of man. When they were once alott,
and had the queen in their hands, who could
promise of what mind they would. then be;
especially as lord Essex, upon his arraign-
ment, defended his first action of imprisoning
the privy counsellors, by pretence that he was
forced to it by his unruly company. So that
if themselves” (that is sir Christopber Blunt
and the rest) “ would not have had, or would
Not seem to have had that extreme and de
vilish wickedness of mind as to lay violent
hands upon the queen’s sacred person, yet
what must be dene to satisfy the multitude,
and secure their party, must then be the ques-
tion.”* That is, when they once had taken
the measures which they meant to take, #
was not in their power to say whether they
would, or would not secure the queen’s lite.
What must be done to satisfy their party must
be then the question. Here, gentlemen, permit
me to draw your attention to. something
which fell from Broomhead, one of the wit-
nesses, who when he was asked whethes
there was any idea of violence or force,
he disclaimed every idea of it ix Ais own mind;
but be added, “ what persons might have
done, if any convention had assembled, I
cannot tell.” A very sensible, very just, and
very proper exposition of the law upon the
subject. Sir Christopher Blunt, and those
indicted with him, when the law had beea
thus stated to them felt the force of it. They
said they had entered into a deeper conside-
ration of the matter; they were sorry they
had given the Court so much trouble, but the
facts of the case were perfectly clear against
them, and they confessed the whole of the
indictment.t They were afterwards exe-
cuted; and sir Christopher Blunt in his
speech at his execution, said that which
shows the propriety of drawing this conch»
ge as an spfallible conclae, warranted
reason and experience, in the s
sid clearest ciao In his peers ai bl
execution, he said, “ although it be true that,
as we all protested in our examinations
arraignments, we never resolved of deing burt
to her majesty’s person (for in none of our
consultations was there set down any such
urpose) yet I kuow and must confess, if we
failed. of our ends, we should, rather than
have been disappointed, even have drawn
blood from herself.” t





Now there, gentlemen, is the confession of
a dying man, who felt and acknowleged, in
his last moments, that although he had never
formed any distinct purpose of doing any
injury whatever to the Queen in the transac-
tion which he has engaged in, yet he saw
the conclusion to which it inevitably led;
namely, as they could not have submitted to
have been disappointed in their purpose, rather
than be so disappointed, they would havedrawn
blood even from their sovereign. It strikes
me that nothing can more cleaily demonstrate
what is the true construction of this law than
the bare narration of the case I have now
cited. It shows that those who have con-
strued the law in the manner in which I have
Stated it, have construed it by drawing infal-
lible conclusions warranted by reason and ex-
perience.

Gentlemen, the cases which are mentioned
by lord Coke by name only, the case of Henry
4th deposing Richard ad, and Edward 4th
deposing Henry 6th show that the humbleness
ofthe demand at the Epaniag of ascheme of
this sort may often lead to the most dreadful
consequences, When the wife of Edward 2d
conspired against her husband, and came over
tothis country with her infant son, her pretence
was, that it was only against evil counsellors.*
In consequence of that declaration, numbers

ined her, who were discontented with the
bars government, unquestionably with very
considerable reason. hat was the result?
The moment she had raised this power, she
got the great seal into her hands, she issued
writs for summoning a parliament in the
king’s name, without his authority, and in his
absence; that parliament when it met, acting
without the king’s authority, was in effect
in the nature of a convention; and they re-
solved to depose the king, and place his son
in his stead. In consequence of this resolu-
tion, they compelled the king to make a
resignation of his crown, which was in no
degree voluntary; and they placed his son
upon the throne. They had no intention to
touch the king’s life; but those who were
more deeply involved in the conspiracy, the
leaders om it, knew that this life was utterly
inconsistent with their safety; andin a very
few months, they contrived that he should be
put to a most cruel death.
hat was the case of Richard 2nd;
was it not the same thing; and when we talk
of the means by which a conspiracy is to be
effected, we know that Henry 4th, when
he first landed at Ravenspurg, had but
twenty-six men. He came, relying upon the
popular discontents within the kingdom, and
was upon the point of guing back. again ;
but being joined by a large body of pools
the king was deposed, and put to death.+






Therefore you are not to imagine that a
distinct cogitation, or intention to destroy the
king, is necessary to constitute the crime of
treason. If the act proposed to be done is
that which in its consequences leads, accord- -
ing to ordinary experience, to the death of the
king, or at least to endanger his life, the act
is in substance high- treason.

Of the persons who formed the convention
in France, for the purpose of establishing a
government, such as itnow is, probably when
they deposed the king a great number had no
idea of touching his life. We know it was a
aestion extremely agitated among them, and

here are strong reasons to believe that the
majority of them, if they had been free agents,
would never have consented tothatact. But
the question, after they had deposed the king,
was not what they would do, but (as was ob-
served in the case of sir Christopher Blunt)
what must be done, to satisfy the multitude,
and secure themselves. The moment they
entered into those ,measures, they were no
longer free agents, the could no longer con-
trol their own acts, and the consequence was
the death of the king. ‘ .

Gentlemen, this dessins is also laid down
with equal clearness in a book which has been
cited by my learned friend, and which appears
to me to demonstrate the impossibility of
putting any other construction upon the sta-
tute. The manner in which the author states
it, is thus—“ The care which the law hath
taken for the personal safety of the king is
not confined to actions or attempts of a more
flagitious kind ; such as attempts either to
assassinate or to poison, or other attempts,
directly and immedjately aiming at his life.
It is extended to ¢very thing, wilfully and
deliberately done or attempted, whereby his
life may be endangered. And, therefore, the
entering into measures for deposing or im-
prisoning him, or to get his person into the
power of the conspirators, these offences are
overt acts of treason, within this branch of
the statute. For experience hath shown, that,
between the prisons and the graves of kings,
the distance is very small.”

Gentlemen, this is the language of a man,
who has, in general, been considered as ex-
tremely correct upon this subject, sir Michael
Foster, who was well known to many persons
now living. He was considered as a man as
little disposed to stretch the law, upon any
subject, as any man that ever sat upon the
bench ; but he saw and felt, that the real
meaning of this statute was, to provide for the
safety ot the constitution of the state, and for
the safety of the person of the king, because he
was the head of that constitution; and be-.
cause, in providing for the safety of the king,
the law necessarily provided also for the safety
of that constitution ; the crown being so fixed
on the king's head, that it could not be pulled
off, but head and life would follow.



I have, therefore, been much at a loss to
collect upon what ground my learned friend
could assert, that nothing could be a compass-
ing the death of the king, under the statute
of Edward Srd, but what would amount toa
compassing the death of any other man, under
the common law. He attributed this asser-
tion to sir Michael Foster; but, with submis-
sion to him, sir Michael Fosterasserts no such
thingin the passage to which my friend alluded.
He is speaking only of the form of the indict-
ment ; and itis perfectly clear, that the case
of the king, and the case cf an individual, are
in no degree parallel. For when the mere
imagining the death of a man, accompanied
with an overt act, was deemed, in law, asa
homicide, it never entered into the idea of
any. man that, to remove a man from his
office, or imprison him, were overt acts of com-
passing his
every authority, are overt acts of compassing
the death of the king, within the meaning of
the statute. The reason of this difference is
clear. In the case of the king, deposing him,

_ imprisonment, or any coercion of that kind
tends to his death, with relation to his poli-
tical character, because he is king, and for no
other reason. You cannot use the term depo-
sition to a private person, nor can imprison-
ment merely have any tendency in itself
whatever to his death.

My learned friend stated another passage,
from lord Hale, page 95, with respect to the
statute of Richard the @nd. At the time he
read that passage, I apprehend he had the
book in his hand. If not, he had certainly
omitted to take from the book the passage
which immediately follows. For, if he had
stated both, he could not have mentioned the
first passage, so as to raise any doubt in your
minds. For lord Hale expressly states, that
the statute of Richard 2nd, was merely for the
purpose of making additional forfeiture of
lands, and a new mode of trial; and adding
some other circumstances in the four cases of
treason, mentioned in the statute, all of which
he states as being actually treason, within
the statute a Nanerd ant and one of them is

leposing the king. it perfectly appears,
that oat Hale naire the mutte Gr the

11 Richard 2nd, as in no degree affecting the

original law upon the subject, and as intended

to introduce only additional severe provisions,
to establish a new unheard-of mode of trial,
and to add some other circumstances; all of
which it was thought proper, by a subsequent
étatute of the 4 enry 4th entirely to sweep

away.
Gentlemen, I mentioned to you, that the
-‘Tegislature had, both in its legislative and in
its judicial capacity, given precisely the same
determination upon the subject. The statute
of the 7 William Srd, limiting the time for
indictments for treason, excepts, by particular
words, persons designing, endeavouring, or
attempting an assassi
the king, by poison, or otherwise; but does

th. But those acts, according to ;

ination on the body of


not generally except treason in compassing
the death of the king; so that the framers of
that statute must necessarily have conceived,
that there existed cases which were (withn
the meaning of the #5 Edward 3rd) compass-
ing the death of the king, and did not come
within the meaning of assassination, or any
such attack immediately upon the person of
the king. And in prosecutions by impeach
ment, in lord Lovat’s case,® and lord Win-
toun’s caset where the charge has been of
treason, in compassing the death of the king,
the same decisions have been made. In lord
Wintoun’s case, sir Joseph Jekyll (who has
generally been understood to have been as
constitutional a lawyer, and as a whig,
as any that ever existed) states the law thus:
“a conspiracy to levy war, with intent
depose the king, is treason; and such a con-
spiracy, to levy such a war, has been held to
be an overt act of compassing and imagining
the death of the king.” He then speaks
another overt act alleged, which was lord
rintaiia's forcing with others, in proclaiming
the pretender: “ which,” says he, “is endes-
vouring to set up another prince, in the room
of his majesty, and I believe it will not be
doubted, but that is likewise an overt act
the same species of treason; and if there
wanted another overt act, the levying war
against the king, with intent to depose him
(which is likewise mentioned ip the articlesas
a distinct species of treason) may serve for an
overt act of the other species of Fon tbouge
and imagining the king’s death. For,
it is reckoned in the statute as a distinct trea-
son, yet it doth not thereby cease to be of the
nature of an overt act of compassing and
imagining the king’s death, which it wassa-
tecedent to its being declared a sshinet pets:
and this point is likewise supported by au-
thorities, and many attainders have been
upon it.’t

This was declared, by sir Joseph Jekyll, oa
behalf of all the commons of England, on the
impeachment of lord Wintoun, before
House of Lords ; and lord Wintoun was
guilty of treason upon that impeachment;
and judgment being propounesd against him,
the ing as the head of the commonwealth,
issued his warrant upon such judgment, for
the execution of lord Wintoun. In that deci
sion, you have, therefore, the three branches
of the legislature, in their respective capacities,
giving precisely the same construction of the
act, which is now contended for. __

have been guilty of treason, seems to me very
extraordinary. In the assassination plot® it
appeared, upon the evidence, that the inten-
tion to kill the king was only in case the eon-
spirators could not secure bis person. Their
design was not to kill him, but to endeavour
to secure his person, and send him out of the
country ; and it was only in case they should
not be able to secure his person, that they
meant to assassinate him. In Layer’s case+
it was expressly proved, that the design to
seize the King’s person, was not for the pur-
pose of killing him, but in order to protect
him from insult. The intention of the party
was, to make the pretender king, and to seize
the person of George 1st, for the purpose of
sending him back to Hanover.

In lord Cobham’s case, in the reign of
James 1st, the conspiracy was, to seize the
king’s person indeed; but not with any
view of deposing him (except by depriving
him of power fora time) nor for the purpose
of injuring his person, in any degree whatever,
but for the purpose only of compelling him
to assent to the general toleration of the
Roman Catholic religion in this country, and
to certain acts, intended to be proposed for
that purpose.

Gentlemen, under these circumstances I
shall take the law to be perfectly clear, that,
if a conspiracy is iret to despoil the king
of his kingly office, and the exercise of his
authority, in such manner as the spirit of the
constitution requires, it is a_eonspit to
depose the king, and therefore it is high
treason in compassing the death of the king.

Gentlemen, it has been next insisted, that
the nature of the evidence required to prove
high treason is different from that which is
required in any other case, by force of the
word ‘ provably,’ used in the statute of Edward
Srd, and that, therefore, the evidence must
be direct and plain. I conceive, in this res-
pect, the evidence required is exactly the same
4s in other criminal cases, with the addition
only of this circumstance, that there must be
two witnesses, at the least; that is, either
two witnesses to one overt act, or one witness
to one overt act, and another witness to
another overt act, of the same species of
treason. With respect to any other distinc-
tion, in point of evidence, I have found no
authority whatever. Ifthe minds of the j
are not really satisfied ; if the evidence will
Not produce reasonable conviction in their
minds, in no criminal case ought a verdict of

ilty to be pronounced. But if the minds of
the jury are really satisfied; if the evidence
would produce reasonable conviction in the
case of a murder, of a robbery, or of any other
crime, the verdict ought to be precisely the
same, in the case of treason, as in any other
case,

seq.


Another objection which has been raised
is, that the evidence has been carried to so
great a length. ‘It is perfectly immaterial,
whether the evidence is long or short, with
respect to the effect it should have when it is
complete; whether you come to a conclusion
by the proof of many circuynstances, or by the
proof of only one; for, if the conclusion and
result of the whole is a conviction, in your
own minds, of the guilt or innocence of the
person accused, the consequence must neces-
sarily be the sang. ‘

In cases of treason the evidence has often
been very extensive, but certainly in no ease
so extensive as it has been in this. In lord
Strafford’s case,* however, which was a ease
of impeachment, the evidence was very ex-
tensive, and took up a considerable length of
time; and lord Coke, in that book which Mr.
Erskine cited with so much respect, observes,
that the compassing, intent, or imagination of
the king’s death, in a case of this species of
treason, though secret, is to be tried by the

Ts; meaning the jury; and to be discovered
yy circumstances, precedent, concomitant, and
subsequent. By such circumstances you are
to discover the intent; and then you are to
apply that intent to the particular acts which
are all as overt acts of treason, if they
do not in their very nature demonstrate the
intent itself.

Considering the law to be clear, I will now
state the nature of the conspiracy charged
It_is not a simple conspiracy to destroy the
life of the king upon the throne, and aiming
only at him; cat it is a conspiracy (as it has
been attempted to be proved), in effect, to
destroy monarchy altogether; in the language
of one of the letters which has been read to
you, to rip up monarchy by the roots, and
plant democracy in its stead. And I conceive
that this is to be drawn by fair conclusion
from the facts demonstrating a treasonable
conspiracy. An intent to cearoy the monar- .
chy, and an act in pursuance of that inten
demonstrate the intent to compass the deat
of the king, as plainly as an intent to rob fs
demonstrated by a man’s coming up with a

istol to your carriage, and showing that he

as the power, or that he conceives he has it,
to take from you your money. In such cases,
without even demanding your money, if the
thing were intended to be done, and means
were taken for the purpose, the nature of the
attack is utterly unimportant to the question
of guilty or not guilty—it is unimportant
borrowing, as I may do for this purpose, the
nguage of one of the Scots delegates, Mr.
Gerrald) whether the life of the king is to be
endangered by a robber on the heath, or by
associated clubs; and ¥ think that the latter
is far more dangerous. History tells us that
thieves have respected the persons of sovee
reigns, that they have felt for fallen greatness,
which popular conventions never have done.
ee EEE


Gentlemen, I was repeatedly called upon
by my learned friend opposite to me, in his
address to you, to state the point of time when
the prisoner first conceived the criminal in-
tention imputed to him—my answer is, that
it is perfectly immaterial when it was first
conceived. The question is, did he ever con-
ceive it; and if he did, and acted in pursuance
of an intent so conceived, he is guilty of high
treason, although the intent is not necessarily
a distinct intent to destroy the king, but an
intent to do any act which might endanger his
life, by any probable consequences.

Now, gentlemen, has the evidence produced
to you, shown any fact from which it may be

” fairly concluded, that there has been a con-
spiracy to take measures in consequence of
which the king’s life might be put in hazard ;
and has the prisoner done any act or acts, in
furtherance of such design? I think when

the evidence is attended to, that there can be |

no doubt upon the subject.

The atlorney-geteral in his opening, stated
a case, in which he attributed to several’ per-
sons, and particularly to the leaders of these
two societies (of both of which the defendant

‘was a member, and to one of which he was

secretary) one general object, which they con-

sidered as a common cause with other secie-
- ties, and with all the friends of liberty, in all
countries : the establishment of a representa-
tive government, founded on the principles of
the Rights of Man—and he likewise attri-
buted to them, a general pursuit of means,
for the accomplishment of that object—first
by ccllestening the peuple, and secondly by
assembling a convention (or meeting, or
whatever name you choose to give it, for there
is no magic in the word convention) which
should assume the character of a convention
of the people. ;

That is the material point—a convention
which should assume the character ofa conven-
tion of the people, fora convention of the people
on the iprueiples ofthe Rightsof Man, must ne-
cessarily be sovereign. What are the people?

‘Fhe natural power is in the hands of the multi-
tude; the forceremains withthem. Iftherefore
those whohave the natural force are to be called
intoaction by the assembling ofa meeting which
is to assume the authority of a convention of
the people, the whole people are called into
action, and government is necessarily dis-
solved. There is an end of all government;
every constitution must fall before such a
power; because it is the people themselves,
taking back into their own hands, that power
which they had before delegated—I do not
pretend to state principles contrary in that
respect to what these societies have stated—
that power which the people in all coun-
tries must be considered as having dele-
ted. But the moment persons are assem-
led who take upon themselves the character
of a convention of the people, upon every prin-
ciple bat must be, if they are what they as-
sume to be, sovereign: and if they are not


what they assume to bg, still if they assume
to be a convention of the people, they assume
to be sovereign.—Gentlemen, if this is clear,
the end these persons wished to obtain ws
necessarily the deposition of the king, ani
something to be done in consequence of it
It does not absolutely follow of necessity, that
the monarchy should be destroyed, and thata
representative government should be eu-
blished ; for it is possible that the conventica
of the people so assembled might deliberate
with wisdom upon the subject, might be of
opinion that the monarchy was still the bet
form of government, limited in some way
other, and might therefore form a consttr
tion which in its nature should be monarch
cal. But whether ed should do so or not,

still the deposition of the king would be in te
interim as complete, as if they had actualy
destroyed him.

Gentlemen, the principles adopted by these
clubs, give very little room for hope that ifs
convention of the people should have bea
assembled, acting upon those Principes, they
would have established a monarchical &
vernment. For, gentlemen, those princip!
(which they have repeatedly declared, in the
evidence that has been laid before you, at
principles never to be departed from) are ist
“the Le of equal active citizenship, or te
right of every individual to an equal share a
the government of that society of which hes
amember.” And here, gentlemen, I
beg leave to observe a very clear :
distinction between their plan and what is
called the duke of Richmond’s plan—
duke of Richmond's plan never asserted ay
such right of every individual to an equl
share in the government of the society
which he is a member. All that his plo
went to, was simply this—an equal share m
the constitution of that body of represeot-
tives who should act in the manner in which
the House of Commons does in this country,
in the legislature of the country—a thing %
different as light and darkness, from an equal
share in the government of the society
which he is a member—and yet you will hot,
throughout the resolutions of these perso
that constantly the right of active citizenship,
the right of universal representation, is appl?
to the whole government, and is not confined, @
any one instance (at least I have not f
one) to such a body as the House of Commons
is in this country. This right to an ¢q
share in the government, is the necessil]
consequence and result of that pe He upon
which they assert the right of equal scuve
citizenship ; and it cannot be questioned, thst
the moment you assume that every ms2 FI
a right to an equal share in the government
which he is a member, the moment you take
that as a principle, all the rest must
sarily follow. iat, bit

The next assertion of these societies 5, ™
the exercise of that right of equal active ©
tizenship in appointing an adequate repre


> tative government, is essential to the security
of that very right of equal active citizenship.
. So it unquestionably is; because in no man-
ner but by the election of all those with whom
power is entrusted, can every individual enjoy
the right of equal active citizenship. But if
there are to be peers, and aking in the conn
there cannot be equal active citizenship. If
the king and peers are to have a distinction,
however small it may be, they cannot be
equal active citizens with the rest. You must
perceive, therefore, that the moment it is es-
tablished as a principle, that there is a right
in every individual to an equal share in the
wernment of the society to which he be-
longs, monarchy falls to the ground, because
itis utterly inconsistent with that peinciple ;
and you will recollect, that in the books
which have been produced to you, this is laid
down asa very clear consequence from the
principle; and it is asserted, that there was a
manifest contradiction in the French consti-
tution of 1791, because, having established
the pricciple, it still retained a king in its
form of government.

There was another objection I recollect, to
this French constitution, resulting from the
same principles. That all persons ought to
be deemed equally qualified to vote for the
election of a representative body, however
small their property ; so that every individual
ought to have an equal right ofvoting. Hav-

ing established, therefore, the right of every
individual to an equal share in the govern-
ment of the society of which he is a member,
and the exercise of that right in appointing an
adequate representative government, they ne-
cessarily claim, as one of the rights of man, in
the third place,“ The right of universal suffrage
and annual parliaments ;? — And this, not
ithe | as a wise regulation, but as necessarily
included in the constitution of a representative
Prraurent formed on their fae —
tis stated by Mr. Paine and Mr. Barlow,
that a government in which those rights are
withheld, is an usurpation of the rights of
man; and so it necessarily is, if these authors
are right in their first principles.—This origi-
nal and continual right of universal suffrage
is also a necessary consequence of the right
of equal, active citizenship; because that
equality must necessarily fe destroyed by
long delegation of either legislative or execu-
tive power; and therefore the delegation
must be renewed as often as circumstances
will admit. .
_A fourth necessary consequence is, the
right of perpetual revolution. The right of
ging their constitution and government,
when, as often, and in what manner they
may think proper ; still, necessarily, according
to their principles, adhering to some form of
Tepresentative government, frequently to be
renewed; because any fourm of government,
which is not a representative government,
and is not frequently renewed, is necessarily
contrary to the right of equal, active citizen-


ship; and it therefore is,.according to their
principles, an usurpation of the indefeasible
tights of man, and is unlawful—tyranny—
despotism—or is liable to any other of the
harsh appellations which they are pleased to
apply to every existing government in the
world.—_—Gentlemen, this conclusion is ine-
vitable from the principle which they assume,
of equal, active citizenship—I certainly will
not here dispute-with them the truth of their
assumption, whether it is well or ill found-
ed. I think it would be no very difficult task
to prove that it is ill-founded; and for this
reason, if for no other, that it necessarily leads
to persue! and constant revolution. But,
without entering into any discussion upon the
subject, it is sufficient that these are no prin-
ciples, nor ever have been conceived to be
principles, in the English constitution:—They
are utterly inconsistent with monarchy ; they
are utterly inconsistent with a House of
Lords, and with many other parts of our esta-
blishment; and therefore, persons who at.
tempt to procure the establishment of these
principles, as principles upon which the con-
stitution and government of this country
ought to be founded, and who hold that any
government founded upon other principles,
is necessarily an usurpation of their inde-
feasible rights, if they take any steps what-
ever for the purpose of altering the establish-
ed government, they must be conceived, primé
facie, to have within their view the intent of
destroying the existing government, of abo-
lishing the kingly office, of abolishing the
House of Lords, and all the great officers,
ranks, and distinctions in this country; of
abolishing also the House of Commons, as it
is now established, and of forming a constitu-
tion of government upon their own principles
because no other constitution of government
can, according to the tenets which they hold,
be a lawful government.

Now, gentlemen, it is proved that persons
holding these principles, had formed a design
for assembling a convention or meeting,
which should assume the character of a con-
vention of the people; that in the prosecu-
tion of this design, they did various acts;
and particularly, that the prisoner at the bar
did various acts—writing letters, being pre-
sent at meetings and a variety of other acts,
all tending to the completion of this purpose.
——A case so proved, must necessarily
-amount fo high treason, because it is impos-
sible that the conception should have been
formed for assembling a convention under
such circumstances, without those who form-
ed it conceiving in their minds a wish and
purpose to destroy the existing government,
and to establish in its place a government
founded on principles totally opposite to those
on which the existing government is founded.
—When such persons assemble for the purpose
of effecting a reformation in the government
of the country, it is fairly to be presumed, in
the first iustance, that they do it for the pur
of carrying into effect those principles
Phich hey fave so laid dowa; and if they
attempt this by means of a meeting which is
to assume the character of a convention of the
, by the very act of assembling a meet-
ing which is to assume that character, they
declare completely, that such is their inten-
tion, because the convention, if truly a con-
vention of the people, cannot be assembled
without the possession of abbas power.
It certainly is not necessary that the pur-
se which is imputed to the prisoner in this
indictment, should be proved to its full ex-
tent, in order to F ee finding him guilty.
But I apprehend that it has been 90 proved.
A much less case seems to me to bring the
isoner withia the penalties of high treason.
Fr hes been shown, at least, that those per
sens who were concerned with him, had
formed a design to procure some alteration in
the constitution of the sovereign power of the
state, and that they lad taken some steps for
that purpose. —If they formed a design of
procuring any alteration, otherwise than by
acts of the constituted legislature, of the
King, Lords, and Commons, in parliament
assembled, and acting in perfect freedom ; for
if they do not act in peréect freedom, they
ate not the constituted legislature ef the
country—it is ridiculous to ‘call them 0, if
they are put under restraint—if a man is put
restraint, any act which he does is void
—if he is compelled to do it, it is not his act
and so with respect to abe legislature; if
they are not free agents, they are not the com-
stituted legislature—they are not that thing
which was intended by the framers of the
constitution of the couatry to be that body
which should make laws to bind the rest of
the people.—Then, if these persons formed
a design of procuring any alteration ef the
constitution, otherwise than by means of the
constituted legislature, acting as free agents,
they formed a design to depose the king from
his royal authority ; and that deposition is, if
1am sight in the law [ have stated, compas-
sing the death of the king; and this being
manifested by any act in pursuance of the de-
sign, the measure of their guilt was full ; they
were guilty of high treason—for, if any
y is attempted to be made in the con-
stitution of the sovereign power of a state,
otherwise than by its own authority, from the
mement the attempt begins to operate, the
constituted sovereign power of the state
ceases to be such, is deposed from its
authority, at least to ihe extent necessary to
effect the particular change. The law of
England admits of no distiaction between the
deposition of the king :for a day or an hour,
and his deposition for ever. The guilt of
high treason attaches to the first, as well as to

In the case of lord Cobham, it was not
the view of the persons who were conceme,
that the acts which they proposed to &,
should, for any continuance, deprive the kn
of his royal authority; but they conceive
that, within e certain time (according to m
Tecollection of the circumstances, witkz
about a month) they should be able to efx.
tuate their pi 3 and that they shou
have brought about all they meant to bart
done, in the mean time, in the king’s num
And yet there was ne doubt that that ona
deposition of the king, if it bad bee ¢
fected only for the short time during wha
they meant to effect it, would have bea z
commpletely high treason as if they had»
tended to depose him for ever.

themselves to the established legislature of
the country, their act was necessarily an act
of usurpation of the sovereign power; and if
they were simply devising the means by which
the people, at any future time, were by their
own power to do this for themsclves, it is
exactly the same thing as if this Convention,
had it been assembled, should themselves do
it.—They would be only doing it more re-
motely; but they would be taking steps to-
wards effecting their own original design—
that of making a change in the existing go-
vernment, by their own power, and not by the
free power of the existing legislature —
Gentlemen, if they had conceived this parti-
cular desizn, still I conceive their proceedings
would have been equally destnictive to the
existing government; for the mcans taken


for the purpose, must be all tending to effect
the pa plan which they had in view, and
which they clearly meant te effect by their
own strength, and not by any such applica.
tion to the legislature as has~been con-
tended.

Gentlemen, when you consider what has
passed in France, you must be perfectly
aware of the effects of a national constituted
assembly. When the states general of France
were called together by the king, before half
of them were assembled, such of them, who
were principally of the third order, as were
assembled, declared themselves to be a na-
tional assembly ; that is, an assembly of the
people; and they immediately declared that
according to that principle, namely, that they
were an assembly of the people, the king
could put no negative upon their proceedings.
That was one of the first measures of that
assembly; and the moment they had done
so, it’ is evident to every person who has
looked at all into the history of that country,
that the king of France was, in effect, de-
posed from that very moment (I think the
7th of June, 1789) by less than a mvuiety of
the whole assembly intended to be convened,
meeting together, and assuming the charac-
ter of a convention of the people; declaring
themselves a national assembly, and that the
ing could put no negative upon their pro-
ceedings, and that they would not separate
till they had effected their purpose. They
immediately took upon them to act as the so-
vereign power of the country; they took upon
them to declare that all the existing taxes
were illegal; that those taxes should be re-
ceived for a time, but should onty be received
so long as that assembly should sit, From
that moment, therefore, in effect the king of
France was deposed; a constitution was
afterwards formed, and to that constitution
he gave his assent in 1791. He was then
again upon the throne; but upon which
throne he was not king in the character
which he had before, but he was king by a
perfectly new title, and in a perfectly new -
character. Such is the necessary course, and
such the necessary consequence of a national
constituted assembly. If you look to what
has passed in your own country, and to that
which is so continually referred to in the
course of these proceedings, namely, the Re-
volution in 1688, you will find, to a certain
extent, the same thing done ;—for what was
that assembly which pe the prince and prin-
cess of Orange on the throne?—King James
having done that which occasioned a general
rising of his subjects against him, he deserted
the country, and an assembly was - called,
under no regular authority, but under letters
similar to those which had been used for the
purpose of calling together the persons who
were entitled to be summoned to parliament,
and letters directed to the sheriffs of the several
counties, to cause elections to be made by the
persons entitled to vote for members tu be

returned to parliament. That assembly met
—in what character? It met as a convention
of all the estates and degrees of the people;
it acted as such ; its authority was acquiesced
in, and it did all that was necessary for its
particular purpose. The government of the
country remained as it was, with the excep-
tion of one single circumstance—the throne
was vacant—the Convention supplied that
vacancy ; and from the moment it had sup-
plied the vacancy, by declaring the prince and
princess of Orange king and queen, from that
Anstant, its character as a convention ceased ;
it was no longer an assembly which repre-
sented the three estates of the realm, it was
.assumed by William to act as a regular par-
liament, and from that time acted as such,
shaving before acted as a mere convention or
assernbly of the three estates; in consequence
of which, when acting as a parliament, it was
commonly called the Convention Parliament.
But in the act of giving the crown to the
_Ptince of Orange, it acted with complete so-
vereign power, and acted in rebellion, if I
‘May so term it, to James the 2nd; for he
‘would have been completely deposed the mo-
‘Ment that convention assembled,. if he had
not previously abdicated the throne ; and this
aS a necessary consequence of assembling
such a species of convention.

Gentlemen, the moment, therefore, as I
conceive, that there is an-assembly assuming
to itself the character of a convention of the
people, and able to sustain itself against the
‘government of the country, there is an insur-
.Fection against that government, and all those
consequences follow which are so fully de-
tailed in that speech of Barrere, which was
read to you—the king is immediately deposed,
and deprived of his inviolability, so far asa
convention has power to act.

Now, gentlemen, if a meeting which could
assume the title of aconvention of the people,
could lawfully assemble themselves, what must
be the consequence? If the meeting is really
a convention of the people, and it be lawful
for them to assemble, the king must be bound

‘to obcy; he is no longer sovereign, or the
head of the sovereign power ; the parliament
must also be bound: to obey this convention.
Being in its nature the sovereign power of the
state, resistance to its authority must be re-
sistance to the sovereign power of the state;
for the moment the meéting assembled, it
must be the sovereign power, and the king,
.in the very act of resisting the authority of
such an assembly, if it could afterwards sus-
tain itself, must be guilty himself of what
might be deemed treason against the sove-
reign power of the state; he would be resist-
ing the power which he ought to obey, and
the assembly would have a pretence for put-
ting him to death; the very same pretence as
in ie case of king Charles 1st. If, therefore,
it appears to you that these persons had form-
ed a conspiracy to assemble a number of per-
sons who should assume, when assembled, the


(120

character of a convention of the pedple, a
that they had taken steps for that purpose;
that alone would constitute the crime of high
treason. .
Gentlemen, the conspiracy which has ber
alleged is of a very wide and extensive petur:
@ eireumstance which has occasioned a cons-
derable degree of complaint on the part of m
learned friends, as it has produced very
tensive evidence. The persons concerae!
have been actingat different times in differen:
places, and sometimes, perhaps, by difiert!
means, but allof them havingin view,as ce
ceive (when I say all, I mean the leaders),
grand plan, the accomplishment of which m
the object of all. This has occasioned th
distribution of the evidence into those tm
parts noticed by Mr. Gibbs, which were po
duced to establish, first, the existence of te
general conspiracy; and secondly, the ja
which the prisoner had in it. I conceive tat
when you consider. the evidence taken als
ther, you can have no sort of doubt of boti
Gentlemen, let me take the evidencea Ix:
by degrees ; and in so doing, as I see there w:
be no end in taking it in detail, I shall nee
sarily trust to your giving some creditto ar
assertion, without referring to every partol
evidence, expecting his lordship will sf
wards sum it up more in detail to you. Fra
the several publications and papers gveo 4
evidence, I think I may assume it to be pe
fectly clear, that there were some persons
this country—and I will instance Mr. Pane.
and Mr. Barlow, who were desirous of efi«-
ing the general destruction of the British Lo
stitution, and particularly of monarchy, a
all hereditary honours ; and who were dsx«
ed to promote, to the utmost of their por
any measures for that purpose. T think, ges
tlemen, you cannot have attended to the e-
dence, without admitting that Ido notsssam
too much, when I assume that it cannot bs
fairly contended that such persons as Parse
and Barlow were not, in effect, conspinior
against the constitution of this cout’.
‘Lhere were persons also in France #ho cot
under the same description, and particulars
(with great submission) I shall venture 0%
clude in that description the French Nato
Convention ; for they were clearly disposed
establish that doctrine here, which ee
established in their own country, but ¥4¢>
is directly adverse to the British Constituls?:
and they were desirous of doing it for be
son, because they felt that their own salt!
depended upon it. You will recollect re
haps, a passage in Paine’s work, whi a
was read;—* When France sball be #
rounded with revolutions, she Cot
peace and safety.” And the Society for Co.
stitutional Information, and the Lo te
responding Society, accordingly addres 198,
National Convention in 2} overnber er
(which, by-the-by, neither of the coun”:
the prisoner at the bar took any ip
whatever, though they appeared ve

tant papers, forthe purpose of showing the
intention of these people) ;—You will recollect
+ that the London Corresponding Society, in
particular, “ fervently supplicated the Al-
mighty Ruler of the Universe to be favour-
able to the cause of the French, so intimately
blended with their own.” This you will re-
collect was not during the existence of the
Constitution of 1791, but after the destruction
of that constitution, and the total deposition
: of Louis 16th; and then they considered the
cause of the French as intimately blended
with their own. How could it be blended
with their own, unless it was their object to
establish in this country a government upon
the same principles upon which the French
: had established their government, or were
_ endeavouring to establish a government?
They conceived “ that it was their duty to
: countenance and assist, to the utmost of their

power, the champions of human happiness ;
that they would therefure oppose, to the ut-
most of tlicir power, any thing hostile to
them on the part of Great Britain; and they
looked to the triple alliance of the people of
America, France, and Britain to give freedom
to the world.”

Gentlemen, the words which are made use
of, are very strong; for it is not simply “ of
the people,” but they are—“ If you succeed,
as we ardently wish, the triple alliance (not of
crowns, but) of the people of America, France
and Britain, will give peace to Europe, and
freedom to the whole world.” Therefore they
did not simply make use of the word “ peo-
ple,” an expression that might comprehend
the whole; but they expressly negatived
crowns. There existed no crown in America
—at that time none in France; the only coun-
try mentioned in this paper which had a crown
was Great Britain. Therefore when they ar-
dently wished a triple alliance, not of crowns,
but of the people of America, France and Bri-
tain, to give peace to the whole world, what
do they do but in terms, not to be controvert-
ed, declare, that it is their wish and intention
—that is, that they had formed a conspi-
racy, for I do not know what a conspiracy
is, but forming a wish and intention to do a
thing—that they had formed a wish and in-
tention of establishing a government in this
country without acrown? I can give it no
Other interpretation. In another part of their
address they say—secking our real enemies,
we find them in our bosoms. We feel our-
selves inwardly torn by, and ever the victims
of, a restless and all consuming aristucracy, hi-
therto the bane of every nation under the sun.
Wisely have you acted in expelling it from

France,”
. Why, gentlemen, what do they mean by
“ aristocracy” here? Whatcan they possibly
mean but to refer to that part of the consti-
tution in the government of this country which
may be deemed aristocratical ?—do not they
declare in that passage, that they consider
every thing to which they can give the deno-


mination of aristocracy, as their real enemics ;
that they consider it as the bane of every na-
tion under the sun; and, therefore, they con-
ceived the French had acted wisely in expel-
ling it from France? It must have been their
opinion that it would be equally wise to expel’
it from this country. For what purpose could
this address be presented to the French Con-:
vention? There might be two purposes ; one
that of publishing to the country here, in a
way which they might fancy to be in some’
degree safc, a declaration against the existing
government of the country; a sort of procla-’
mation of a republic; and another, a holding
out to the French Convention, that they were:
desirous of receiving every assistance from that.
country which could possibly be given, for the
purpose of enabling those who addressed them
to establish the same constitution of gavern->
ment in this country, as had been established
in France. ’
The Address which was presented by the
other society, the Society for Constitutional
Information, is full as strong. You observe,
the learned counsel for the prisoner have cau-
tiously avoided taking any notice ofthisaddress,
In truth, they were unable to give any expla-
nation of it. How does this address begin?
“ Servants of a Sovereign People,and Benefac-
tors of Mankind,—We rejoice that your Revo~
lution has arrived at that point of perfection,
which will permit us to address you by this:
title.” The degree to which, as they con-
ceive, a Revolution must arrive to be at its
point of perfection, is, when those who have
the administration of the government of the
country, are to be addressed in the character:
in which they thus address the French Con-:
vention; that is, “Servants of a Sovereign
People.” What is this but a declaration, that
the perfection 6f a Revolution in government,
is the establishment of the principles, which
we have before adverted to, of the Rights of.
Man, and equal citizenship, and so on, ia
which the people are to be considered as
constantly sovereign as constantly exerting
the sovereign authority, and as having a per-
petual control over the whole government
of the country; not an indirect and remote
control; that species of control, which:
is consistent with the stability of the gao-
vernment of a country; but that which leads,
in its principle, to the sort of perpetual Revo-
lution, upon which I have before observed ?
The address proceeds, “ We rejoice that your
Revolution has arrived at that point of perfec-
tion, which will permit us to address you by
this title; it is the only one that can accord
with the character of true legislators.” Is
not this a clear and express declaration, that
they did not consider the legislature of this
country, as having that title which could ac-
cord with the character of true legislators ?
For no reform in the House of Commons;
alone, could give to the legislators of this
country, a title to that character, according to
the idea of these persons upon the gubject.

For the King and House of Lords, still remain-
ing parts of the legislature, and being heredi-
tary, could not, by any possibility, come with-
in that description which they meant to attri-
bute to the French Convention.—They add,
“ Every successive epoch in your affairs has
added something to the eels of Liberty ;
and the glorious victory of the 10th of Au-
gust, has finally prepared the way for a con-
Stitntion, which, we trust, you will establish
on the basis of Reason and Nature.”

Gentlemen, I have nothing to do with the
propriety or impropriety of the conduct of
those who were concerned in the transactions
ofthe 10th of August. It would be wrong
for me to blame one side or the other. But
to which ever side blame was imputable, v-hat
was the event? ‘The event was the destruction
of monarchy. ‘That is here called a glorious
Victory ; it is said to have finally prepared the
way for a constitution, which the society
trusted would be established on the basis of
Teason and nature; it had brought them to
that situation which enabled them to arrive,
finally, at that point of. perfection, expressed
in the former part of the address.

Now, gentlemen, to say that any persons
who could give their assent to that Address
knowing what they were about, or attending
to it, entertained a sincere attachment to any
of the principles upon which the British con-
stitution is founded, is asserting that which it
secins to me, that no rational man can possibly

ive credit to. I cannot help here observing,
by the way, upon the words,— Finally pre-
pared the way for a constitution, which, we
trust, you will establish on the basis of reason
and nature.” Gentlemen, you will recollect
there were two passages; onc in Mr. Paine’s
work, the other in Juel Barlow’s, before this
glorious victory of the 10th of August, which
expressly stated, that they looked to that
event; to the destruction of the constitution
which had been formed in 1791, for this reason;
because it was formed in contradiction to the
Principles of the Rights of Man, in the parts
of it which consisted of a monarch, or any
thing in the nature of distinctions of privi-
leged orders. ‘That so far as it had any sort
of distinction whatever, and was not com-
pietely founded upon the right of equal active
citizenship, it was a compound of contradic-
tions, as, I think, Paine calls it in his publi-
cation, the Rights of Man, and therefore in
its nature it could not subsist.

In another passage of the same address,
speaking of the cause of the i'rench, they
say, “It is, indeed, a sacred cause. We
ehcrish it, as the pledge of your happiness,
our natural and nearest friends "—Then they
say, that they speak, as they conceive, the
real opinion of a great majority of the Euglish
nation; and, finally, they conclude with the
* wonderful splendor of the French revolu-
tion, bursting forth upon the nations, in the
full fervor of the meridian sun, and displaying
in the midst of the European world, the prace


tical result of principles, which philosophy
had sought in the shade of speculation, and
which experience must every where contimm.
It dispels the clouds of prejudice from all
people, reveals the secrets of all despotism,
and creates a new character in man.”

Now cana more clear comment be read,
upon the words of Paine and Barlow, than
the words contained in the passage which
have just read? Do they not clearly show
you, that those societies are here stating s
combination of principles with practice, in
the same manner as Paine has done,
the second par. of his works? That they
are endeavouring io remove that prejucice
from the people, which Mr. Paine conceires
supported monarchy and aristocracy in ths
country? It is said, by Paine and Barlos,
that the first assembly, which ended in th
year 1791, had been obliged, through te
prejudices of the people, to form that cons-
tution in the manner in which they bad
formed it, retaining a king, because the pre-
judices of the peopie would not at that time,
permit them to form a government, without
aking. It was too much, at that time, to
form a government without a king; but the
principles upon which they formed their g>
vernment, necessarily led to the destruction
of that portion of monarchy which they had
left.—« Your example will be soon followed?
for nations, rising from their lethargy, will
te claim the Rights of Man, with a voice
which man cannot resist."—The Righits of
Man, in this passage, are the Rights of Man
as they are stated in Painé’s works; for ths
society has expressly declared Paine's worss
to be the foundation of all their proceediogs
They have considered themselves as proceet-
ing to establish the Rights of Man, as tsuz!
by Thomas Painc.—\ou must recollect par
sages to this effect, in several instances—
And, therefore, when they say, “ will re-claim
the Rights of Man, with voice which m2
cannot resist,” they must be taken to maa
the Rights of Man, in the full extent of we
doctrine laid down in Paine’s book.

Gentlemen, I may add to this a remark, by
the way, that it is a little extraordinary, cou
sidering how much the Constitutional Society
has been involved in this case, and how im
portant it would have been for the prisoner,
at the bar, to have brought some members o!
that society to have explained this transactioa,
—all the transactions, indeed, of that societ’,
and particularly this Address ; that not one
member of the Constitutional Society 5
brought as a witness on this trial, except that
poor dancing master, who is a member o
both societies, and who seemed incapatle ¢
understanding any thing that passed. ith
same thing occurs, to a great degree, ®!
respect to the London Corresponding Soatly-
Notone witness whom they have brous™,
was a person capable, from the descnpvo
he gave of himself, of accounting, 19 any
manner whatever, for the Address of he
London Corresponding Society,


Gentlemen, you remember the manner in
which these two Addresses were passed in
these societies. The letter which was sent
by Hardy, first, and the debate that passed
between them, whether there should be a
joint, or a separate address? This was not a
thing taken up in a hurry, but a thing consi-

: dered, and much debated upon; one in one
form, and the other in another. If any evi-
dence, upon this subject, could possibly
have been given, which could have been

advantageous to the prisoner at the bar, it,

would certainly have been produced. In
truth, both these addresses hold out, in
pretty strong terms, a wish for an alliance
and friendship with another country; that
country certainly was not, at the time when
these addresses were presented, in any
adverse situation to this; but still, with
respect to-this country, in such a situation as
made it a matter deserving some degree of
Caution, at least, or such as one should ima-
gine would induce persons, thinking of pre-
senting such addresses, to reflect a little upon
it, befure they did it.

How are these addresses received? One of
the persons who were sent over with that of
the Constitutional Society (how the London
Sesfeponding Society's Address got over,
we have not been able to show) was Mr. Joel
Barlow, the gentleman who had written the
* Advice to the Privileged Orders,”: in which
he has completely stated what his ideas were,
upon the subject of government, who: had
reeently written an Address to the French
Convention, with respect to the defects in
their constitution of 1791, pointing -out a
principal defect in that constitution to be the
existence of a king and several other things,
which, he conceived, ought to be removed,
to render the government more complete,
upon the principles of the Rights of Man.
The other person was Mr. Frost, who, I
shall likewise observe to you, is not called as
a witness, on behalf of the prisoner. He
‘was a person who had made himself a little
obnoxious, and who afterwards became the
object of a prosecution. When this address
was presented to the National Assembly, in
France, the president of the French Assemb!
perfectly understood the matter. You will
recollect, that.there was likewise an address
pronounced by the gentlemen who presented
this address. Mr. Barlow and Mr. Frost were
admitted to the bar, and thus addressed the
Assembly : “ Citizens of France, We are de-
puted from the Society for Constitutional
Information, in London, to present to you
their congratulations on the triumphs of
Liberty.—This society had laboured long in
the cause, with little pruspect of success, pre-
vious to the commencement of your revolu-
tion.” What is this but a declaration, that
this society had, before the French revolution,
been employing itself exactly upon the same
Principles as those upon which the French
revolution was -effected? “Conceive, then,


their exultation of gratitude, when, by the
astonishing efforts of your nation, they behold
the reign of reason acquiring an extension
and solidity, which promise to reward the
labours of all good men, by securing the hap-
piness of their fellow creatures.” Now, if
this society had made this Address to the
National Assembly, which finished when
they had formed the constitution of 1791, it
might have admitted, in some degree, of a
different construction; but they never ad-
dressed that assembly, which formed the con-
stitution of 1791. Why? Because the assem-
bly, which formed the constitution of 1791, had
not brought the revolution to the point of
perfection. That was the reason they never
addressed that assembly. On the contrary,
till the revolution of the 10th of August took.
place, they had no idea of entering into this
sort of correspondence with the French.
They then make these Addresses to the French
Convention, at the same time declaring, that,
before this revolution, the society had em-
ployed itself on the same important object.—
‘“ Innumerable societies, of a similar nature,
are now forming in every part of England,
Scotland, and Ireland; they excite a spirit of
universal inquiry into the complicated abuses
of government, and the simple means of
reform. After the example which France has

iven, the science of revolutions will be ren-

ered easy.” Now, how was this revolution
effected in France? By an assembly of the
people ; lawfully assembled under the autho-
rity of the king, but taking upon themselves
of their own authority, to declare themselves
a convention of the people. These are the
means by which this revolution was effected ;
from that moment the fate king of France
was deposed; from that moment the late
revolution began ; and from that point it pro-
ceeded to its present situation. “ After the
example given by France, the science of revo-
lutions will be rendered easy, and the progress
of reason will be rapid. It would not be
strange, if, in a period far short of what we
should venture to predict, addresses of felici-
tation should cross the seas to a National
Convention in England.” Now, what is the
meaning of a National Convention in Eng-
land ? Is this to be understood of a meeting
of people, for the purpose of petitioning pare
liament for a reform of parliament? What
can it mean but a convention, assuming all
the powers of government, precisely as the.
National Convention of France, at that time,
did? Is it possible to conceive, that any other
construction can fairly be put upon those
words? And have they brought one single
man of this society, for the purpose uf showing,
that such is not the construction which ought
to be put upon these words?

What is the answer of the president of the
National Assembly? He has no sort of doubt
of the intention and meaning of those persons;
for he immediately calls them, “ Generous
Republicans.” He could not have a concep-

tion of -their principles, otherwise than as re-
publican principles. When men addressed
them in that style, they could not have an
idea, that they were friends to the House of
Commons, to the old peers, or to the new
ones. The answerof the French presidentis :
— Generous Republicans, your appearance
in this place will form an epoch in the history
of mankind. History will consecrate the day,
when, from a nation, long regarded as a rival,
and in the name ofa great number of your
fellow citizens, you appeared in the midst of
the representatives of the people of France.”
There is another passage, which, indeed, is a
previous passage, which 1 particularly meant
to have read:—“The shades of Pym, of
Hampden, and of Sidney, are hovering over
your heads, and the moment cannot be distant
when the people of France will offer their con-

ratulations to a National Convention in Eng-

land.” Why, gentlemen, the president of the
French National Convention seems not to
have the slightest doubt of the meaning of the
address. He had nota conception, but that
the persons who sentit, were disposed to esta-
blish, and desirous of establishing, in our
country, a republican government ; and that
they had actually taken the means for that
purpose. He says, that the moment could
not be fur distant when the people of France
would offer their congratulations to a national
convention in England. Is it possible to ex-
plain these transactions in any other sense
than that which I have submitted to you? If
it be, why has not some person or other ap-
peared, as a witness, to have given what he
conceives to be the true sense and meaning of
the society, as you will recollect that a great
deal of evidence has been introduced into this
cause, for the purpose of giving constructions
of the same sort? That makes it a very
strong casc; for when persons are called to
give constructions to words of one description,
and there are none called to give a construc-
tion to words of another description, or to
words used in one case, and not to words used
in another, it must, at least, be taken, that, in
that instance in which they do not attempt to
give, by other means, a construction to words,
the words are open to that construction which
the words themselves fairly import. These
words can import nothing else than a declara-
tion of a complete design formed, of establish-
ing, in this country, a republican government;
of bringing about a national conventiun ; to
which national convention, as an assembly,
having in itself the executive and legislative
powet of the government, the national assem-

ly of France might send these congratula-
tions.

Gentlemen, it shows also, that the Conven-
tion, by their decrees of the 19th of November,
and of the 15th of December, 1792, had
adapted that sort of defence, which had been
suggested to them,—“ the giving liberty to
Europe,”—as a mode of defence of their own


[1212

narhe of the French nation, that they would
afford military assistance to all people who
wished to recover their liberty, within which
description they most certainly had considered
the British nation; because tne London Cor-
responding Society, and the Society for Con-
stitutional Information, had expressly asserted
that the British nation were slaves. The
French had, by these decrees, declared that
they would not permit a reformation in the
House of Commons, if it was in their power to
prevent it; they had, in effect, declared, they
would compel the people of this country, at
the request of the London Corresponding So
ciety, and the Society for Constitutional In-
formation, to accept a government, formed
upon the principles of the sovereignty of the
people; and that, if the people of this country
should refuse to accept of Liberty and Equality,
being desirous to preserve their prince, and
their privileged casts, that they would treat
them as enemies.

Thomas Hardy set to the bar.

Mr. Solicitor General_—Gentlemen of the
jury ;—When I had the honour of addressin:
you last night, I stated to you the pa
idea I had of the persons who were engaged
in the transactions which have been brought
in evidence before you, liow far in those trans-
actions (though not specifically and precisely)
how far I conceived the prisoner was generally
implicated; what was his character in those
transactions, and what were the characters of
those who were the agents in them; _protess-
ing to consider, and to believe, that the vast
majority of the persons engaged were not of
that description of persons to whom the
highly criminal intent imputed to the prisoner,
ought to be imputed. I also stated to you
what I conceived to be clearly the law upea
the subject; hoping that, under the direction
of my lords upon the bench, you will be of
opinion that what I have stated as the law, is

Twesdex,

liberty ; and that they had declared, in the | Saeetaly the law of the land, derived

down to us now for-a period of between four
and five hundred years. Having proceeded
then to state to you what appeared to be,
from the evidence, as far as 1 went through
it, the views, objects, and intentions of the
persons concerned in these transactions, I had
arrived at that period when the societies
addressed the National Convention of France,
aud I had insisted considerably at large upon
that transaction. I had insisted upon it,
because it appeared to me to be a transaction
which showed their views, their intentions,
and their objects so plainly, so clearly, and so
irrefragably, that 1 thought it impossible, in
any part of the case, more strongly to impress
upon your minds what those views, what
those intentions, and what those objects were,
and how they meant finally to accomplish
those views, intentions and objects, namely,
by assembling a National Convention.

I think, gentlemen, if you advert simply
and only to those two Addresses; to that in-
troduction to one of them when it was pre-
sented to the National Convention by Mr.
Barlow and Mr. Frost, and to the answer
which was given by the president of the
National Convention—an answey in which no
fraud or disguise was necessary to be used,
and in which, on the contrary, the plain truth
was most likely to appear—you can have no
doubt in your own minds that the views, the
objects, and the intentions of the prisoner at
the bar, and of all those who were so far con-
cerned with him as to have a complete con-
mexion with that transaction, were nothing
less than the destruction of the government
of this country, by means of an assembly of
the people, and to establish a representative
government in the room of that government
under which this country has so long flou-
fished, in spite of all the abuses that belong
to it. Abuses will belong to every govern-
ment, perhaps aboininable abuses belong to
this government—I will not dissemble that
there may be such; and as far asin my power,
I should think it my duty to bring them forth
whenever it should be necessary to do so ;—
for whatever situation a man may stand in in
the country, he bas an interest infinitely
dearer than that situation.

Gentlemen, having stated to you what ap-

ted to me to be a reasunable conclusion
tom the transaction with France, which I
have mentioned, I will notice to you the ob-
servations which naturally occur from the cun-
duct of those who were concerned in it: and
I must here observe, that as it has been ex-
tremicly difficult in the course of this long
drial, to mark with certainty all the papers
that have been produced, I may by possibility,
but I am sure it will be unintentionally, men-
Uon to you some papers which may not have
becn actually produced. If I should do so, I
should be much obliged to the counsel for
the prisoner if they can correct me. If not,
Iwish my friends to do so.
, Twas going to state to you a letter from


the society at Stockport to the prisoner, dated
the Srd of November, 1792. Gentlemen,

ou will recollect that with respect to all the
el that have been produced, except, I
think, one, not a single observation has been
made by the counsel for the prisoner. That
one is a letter from Norwich, which I shall
Notice to you presently. In this letter of the
3rd of November, 1792, the secretary of the
society at Stockport, says, “ I am directed by
the Friends of Universal Peace and the
Rights of Man,” which very title I think, if
you advert to it, plainly shows what the in-
tention and object of these parties were; for
you will recollect (the thought occurs to me
at the moment) that the idea which had been
conceived by those persons, was an enthusiasm
unquestionably, but an enthusiasm dangerous
in the highest degree ;—the idea which they
had conceived was, that by the establishment
of the Rights of Man, universal peace would
be established throughout the world. When,
therefore, persons assuine the appellation of
the Friends of Universal Peace and the Rights
of Man, they plainly declare that they have
Not in view any reform in the government of
this country, as now established, because it
is, according to their declaration, inconsistent
not only ah their conception of the Rights of
Man, but with their conception of the procur-
ing universal peace. Their idea of the means
of procuring universal peace was, that by
establishing a representative government
throughout the world, the interests of the
people would be so immediately considered
y the government of every country, that war
would cease, and universal peace would be
established throughout the universe, and all
the world would be, in effect, one nation,
You will recollect that that has appeared in a
variety of instances in the papers which have
been produced to you. Thatenthusiasm they
certainly had, and an enthusiasin as dangerous
to government as any that ever existed; as
dangerous as the enthusiasm of the millena-
rians, or Fifth Monarchy-men, who in the last
century occasioned some disturbance, not
very violent, indeed, in this country, under an
impression upon their minds that Christ was
to come to establish his own government
upon earth, and that there was to be universal
peace and good-will among men ; what they
called the kingdom of the saints. Under that
impression they made an insurrection in the
reign of Charles the second, which was sup-
pressed after the death of a few people.®
‘There had been an insurrection of the same
nature under the government of Cromwell,
which also was soon suppressed; but the
persons concerned in these transactions, to
the very last persisted in their enthusiasm,
and soine of those executed in the reign of
Charles 2nd, protested in their last mo-
ments, that if they had been deceived, they


had been deceived by heaven. When the
minds of men are capable of being worked up
to such blasphemous expressions, it is not
possible to say to what length they may not

‘o. ‘Their sincerely entertaining such ideas,
does not at all lessen the danger of them;
does not at all lessen the necessity for the
government of the country to take the means
of repressing them, and punishing the delin-
quents in the severest manner. If men
should take it into their heads that the com-
munity of goods is part of the christian re-
ligion, and should upon that ground take the
goods of their neighbours, they must be
punished as robbers, because it is impossible
to preserve the peace of society by any other
means,

Gentlemen, I have digressed in consequence
of what occurred to me from the title which!
these people at Stackport chuse to assume.
The letter proceeds—* I am directed by the
Friends of Universal Peace and the Rights of,
Man, to inform you, that we received two!
letters trom you; the first, dated September
21st, requesting us to concert with you in
transmitting to the French National Conven-
tion an address signed by every member.”—
It then proceeds to that which is not very
material, except that it proves that this society |
in London were not content simply with ad
dressing the French Convention themselves,
but attempted to prevail upon all the other
societies to do the same thing, which they
considered as assisting the cause to avery!
preat degree; and, in aletter from the prisoner

imself, in the course of the transaction—I
forget to whom it was directed, but it is a
letter in which he mentions the subscription |
to the French—thet, in his opinion, a number
of signatures was infinitely better than any
sum of'money they could think of subscribing.

The letter proceeds— with respect tu the
substance of this letter, we believe that the
cause of the French is that of every individual
person in Europe, that is not fattening on
plunder, or who, through ignorance, obstinacy
and inattention, sit unconcerned, and will not
be persuaded to consider, although inevitable
ruin should be the awful consequence.”—
Here you see, gentlemen, that this society at
Stockport declare most clearly what they con-
sidered to be the object of such an address to
the French; that they considered the cause of
the French as their own cause, and likewise
that of every individual person in Europe,
not fattening on plunder.—* We therefore
think it highly necessary to add our friendly
aid and assistance, in order to stimulate the
oppressed friends of freedom in France, against
all the despots in Europe (who are combined
against the just and equal rights of man), by
assuring them that we view their signal excr-
tions, and wonderful victories, with admira-
tion; together with,”—mark this, gentlemen
— together with the extinction of treacher-
ous royalty, and the restoring to every indivi-

dual, his equal, indubitable rights, as fellow | the impression that it was necessary 10
: *


(1216

men and free citizens; and that our heart
are united with theirs, as in one comma
cause, considering, as in a great meas,
their victory our emancipation, togetier with
their own.”

Now, what was that victory ?—The glorious
victory of the 10th of August. Gentiemen,
has not this society at Stockport declared its
views in the most complete and airect terms!
—The extinction of treacherous rovulty*
is here not pointed out ambiguously; oo
pointed out by words which will admit of
a different construction, but by words direct
and plain; by words which require no com
ment, to which no answer could possibly be
given, and to which, therefure, my lesmed
friends did not attempt to give any ansve,
——Gentlemen, their silence upon that sub
ject is conviction —If they could have got nd
of the force and effect of this letter, ty
would have done so.—You cannot curcene
that it was through any want of ability—tha
it was through any want of industry; fer
Tam sure, when you heard, more especialis,
what fell trom my learned triend who spoke
last, you must acknowledge, that (althouzh
not possessing, perhaps, all the ornaments of
eloquence which distinguish some men, and
yet possessing them tu a very considerable
degree) as a judicious, as a forcible, and as 3
really able and convincing advocate, he bss
not his superior. ;

Gentlemen, observe the manner in which
this letter proceeds— “ Yes, should it ever be
the case that our ministry should be so per
dious, as contrary to their pee faith of
neutrality, to join the execrable band of dee
pots against the cause of freedom, we wil
stand forward, even to the hazarding our
lives, by using every justifiable means @
counteract their machinations, and give to
the friends of freedom all the encouragement
and support which-we severally, unsupported,
can afford,” ;

Gentlemen, is not that a clear and plain de
claration—is not that saying, without a doubt,
that considering the cause oft the French as thelr
own cause—considering the victories of the
French as their own victories ; considering
emancipation of the French as theirownemal-
cipation, theywere eager themselvesto
to the extinction of what they call treacheroes
royalty and so to restore toevery individual his
equal and indubitable rights, as free meD
free citizens; and thatthey would do this tothe
hazarding of their lives: Tt seems 10%,
that it is impossible to conceive a more com
plete comment upon those addresses to the
National Convention, than that which is com
tained in this letter.—It seems impossible,
when we advert to the contents of this ltter
to have a doubt what were the obj
the views and intentions of those ag

But, gentlemen, what is the letter
Norwich, which my learned friends oie
descend to observe upon—TI supposs be

|

'
 . selection which in
. perbaps, they found,


- tp take notice of something, and without any

very clear view, I should apprehend, in the
have le of it; unless,
that, in the course of the
evidence, there was very considerable allusion
to it, and therefore they thought it could not

' possibly escape notice.—That letter is dated

November the 11th, 1792.—The letter from
Stockport was the 3d of November.——This
letter from Norwich, you will recollect, was
made the subject even of debate in the meet-
ings of the societies.

It states, “ We, the Society for Political In-
formation at Norwich, are desirous of holding,
and strenuously supporting, the noble senti-
ments, which you” (the London Correspond-
ing Society) “ so lately and friendly dispersed
among us; and, as we so much admire your
well-adapted plan for a reformation in the
state, permit us, with the utmost deference to
your worthy society, to participate with you in
all your great national correspondence, which
your very name promises to maintain ; and in
consequence thereof, it is humbly desired by
the society which I have the happiness to re-
present, to incorporate three members with
yeur worthy fraternity; in doing which, I
shall here inform you of their names and resi-
dence :”—then the three persons are mention-
ed—* Our principal design in doing this, is,
that we may have an opportunity of knowing
more exactly, what may be thought the most
eligible steps to be taken in carrying on this
great business of our associated brethren, and
to have an opportunity to ask such sort of
questions as may be thought very reasonable
among the brethren, especially when we think
that publications are covered with a sort of
obscurity in them, as the Sheffield people’s
declaration, which seems determined to sup-
port the duke of Richmond’s plan only,”

Now there, gentlemen, is a society which |

Perceives a sort of obscurity in the declara-
tions uf the Sheffield society, and states in
what it conceives that obscurity to consist—-
“ especially when we think that publications
are covered with a sort of obscurity in them,
as the Sheffield pevple’s declaration, which
seems determined to support the duke of Rich-
mond’s plan only.”

Gentlemen, you will recollect that the plan
of the duke of Richmond was a plan: which,
however I may think it wild and extravagant,
wasa pan which had no other object what-
ever than that of reforming the House of
Commons in this country, by making all per-
sons who were of a certain age, and not liable
to certain objections, capable of giving their
Votes for the election of members of that
House, dividing the whole country into dis-
tricts for that purpose, and allotting, I think,
about 2,600 votes to the election of every
member, and making the members about 500:
——So that it had not, in any degree whatever,
in view, the giving what is called the right of

, active citizenship? that is the right of
every man to share in the government of the



country; but expressly confining in his letters,
and in all his declarations upon the subject,
his idea of reform, to giving to every man the
right of choosing a person by whom the laws by
which he was to be governed, were to be made
—a distinction very clear-and very plain, but
not very easily to be found in that declaration
of the Sheffield people.—The Norwich Society,
therefore, thought that there was a sort of o!
scurity in the declaration of the Sheffield peo-
ple; in consequence of which, they began to
apprehend that this Sheffield society did not
mean to go the length which they intended.
They say, that, from this declaration of the
Sheffield people, they begin to apprehend that
the Sheftield people seemed determined to
support the duke of Richmond’s plan only.—
The letter adds—“ But, since we find, in a
printed letter received from them in a book,
that they mean to abide by some moderate
reform, as may hereafter be brought forward
by the Friends of the People”’—You will re-
collect, in the interval, the Society of the
Friends of the People was established, which
professed to have in view only a moderate
reform; and which, likewise, if you may
judge from the evidence that has been I ee
atthe bar by some of the members of that
society, never conceived even the duke of
Richmond’s plan to come within the descri
tion of a moderate reform, but always thought
that plan wild and extravagant. The letter
adds—“ which method is uncertain to us.”—
Here you find that the Friends of the People,
and Society for Constitutional Informa-
tion, do not exactly e; and you will re
collect that the Friends of the People, and
the Society for Constitutional Information, se
very little agreed, that the Friends of the Peo-
ple had declared that they would have nothin;
more to do with the Society for Constitution
Information, because they saw clearly, that,
in the transactions in which the Society for
Constitutional Information were engagin;
they had not in view a reform of the Come
mons House of Parliament, but had in view,
as the letter of the Friends of the People
states, the accomplishment of what is termed
“all Mr. Paine’s plans for public benefit ;”
including therefore, necessarily, the extinc-
tion of treacherous royalty, the extinction of
aristocracy, and the establishment of perfect
representation.

The letter proceeds, after observing that
the Friends of the people and the Society for
Constitutional Information did not agrce—
“ We would be glad to know the reason; it
seems to me as though the difference was
this: the Friends of the People mean only 4
partial reform, because they leave out
words expressing the duke of Richrmond’s
plan, and talk only of a reform; while the
Manchester people s¢em to intimate, by ad-
dressing Mr. Paine, as though they were
intent upon republican principles only.”——+
Weare accused of pressing. hard upon the
prisoner for addressing Paine.—Did not this

41

Norwich Society, with whom he corresponded,
consider that, by addressing Paine, the Man-
chester people seemed to intimate that they
were intent upon republican principles only ?
And did not the Friends of the People put the
same construction upon the conduct of the
Society for Constitutional Information.

The letter proceeds —‘* Now, to come
closer to the main question, it is only desired
to know whether the generality of the socie-
ties mean to rest satisfied with the duke’s
plan only”’—conceiving therefore, as you see,

ntlemen, that the least that they were to

vein view, was establishing the duke’s plan
—<‘ Whether the generality of the societies
mean to rest satisfied with the duke’s plan
only ;” that is, whether you struggle for
more, or will be contented with that; for
that must be the meaning of the words— or
whether it is their private design to rip up
monarchy by the roots, and plant democracy
in its stead.”

Gentlemen, when we attend to this letter,
# is impossible not to perceive that this Nor-
wich Society was floating in a degree of un-
certainty with respect to the views of the
other societies, was disposed, perhaps, to be
content with the duke of Richmond’s plan
only, to rest satisfied with it, but at the same
time to obtain whatever it could beyond it.
That this letter was written for the purpose
for which it was supposed by the London
Corresponding Society to have been written,
for the purpose of knowing what were the
true and real sentiments of this London Cor-
responding Society.

Now, gentlemen, if the London Corres-
ponding Society had intended to hold sacred
the House of Lords, and had no object in
view but establishing a new constitution of
the monarchy of the country, to hold sacred
the House of Commons, by universal suffrage
and annual parliaments, would they have he-
sitated in answering this letter? would they,
as described in Lynam’s evidence (and by the
way I would observe that Lynam’s evidence
throughout is capable of being contradicted
by hundreds and Gapdreds of persons, if it be
Not true, and there is not one person brought
to contradict one single word of it), would
they have deliberated in the manner in which
he describes them to have deliberated upon
the subject? would they have thought that
this letter was intended: to draw them into
some incautious declaration, and that in con-
equerce they might be brought into some
difficulties? what incautious declaration could
they have been drawn into by this letter, if
they had meant what it is now pretended
they did mean? Their answer in that case
would have been, “ You have totally mis-
taken us; we have not the most distant idea

~ of what you suppose, of ripping up monarchy
by the roots, and placing democracy in its
Stead; our view is simply and only a reform
of the House of Commons upon the duke of
's plan.” The answer to the letter


was the most simple and plain imaginable, it
never could have been matter for deliberatia
and consideration. They would have treated
this letter as a letter not to draw them i,
except it was to draw them in to do thz
which they did not mean to do, and asa letter
which ought, therefore, to be rejected with
the utmost indignation. But what do they
do? they deliberate upon this letter, whichis
dated the 11th of November, and at
on the 26th of November, they send this a-
swer—it was addressed, first of all, “ Gentle
men,” but that is scratched out, and “ Fell
Citizens” put in its place. Observations have
been made upon the word citizen. U!
tionably we are all citizens of the same sta,
and when the word citizen is used without any
particular allusion, it certainly means notbmg
in any degree improper; but what is the
comment which they themselves have gives
upon the word citizen, in the report of ther
committee of constitution? They distinguish
between citizen and subject—* citizen, the
ancient appellation given to the members of
free states—subject can only, with propriety,
be applied to a member of a state whose go
vernment has been instituted by foreign con
uest, or by the prevalence of a domestic
action.” Thus they have constantly, if you
will recollect, in all their papers, intimated
the most gross falshood—that the British
constitution was a government instituted by
foreign conquest; meaning, as Mr. Paine
thinks proper to assert most falsely, that the
constitution and government of this country
was the result of the Norman conquest,
whereas, in truth, all the alteration that that
comagiteak introduced, was an alteration pra
cipally in the aristocratical part of the consti-
tution, and those must recollect who know
any thing of the history of the country, that
the Saxon es and institutions are the whole
foundation of our government, particularly
that part of it which vonsiats in the admins
tration of justice, which is the great security
of the liberty of the subject ® Thercfore,
gentlemen, the word “ citizen” is not an n-
different word when used by these persoss:
it would be indifferent used by others, but
when used by persons who draw a distinction
between citizen and subject, and who assert
that no persons are to be called subjects bet
those who are members of a state whose co
vernment has been instituted by foreign con-
quest, or the prevalence of a domestic factica,
which they call an usurped government, they
mean to assert that they are determined no
longer to remain subjects of the British co
vernment, but to be fellow citizens of a new
state.

Gentlemen, the letter having in its adcres
the alteration from “ Gentlemen” to “ Fellow
Citizens,” proceeds thus—“ Your letter of the
11th instant, was by the secretary laid behre
the Committee of Delegates of the London




Corresponding Society; the London Corres-}| They proceed, gentlemen, to say, “ they

ponding Society having never before heard of
your society, wish to have some further in-
formation concerning it, as to its origin, its
principles, and the number of its members.
h an account in your next letter will give
them great satisfaction.” Here, gentlemen,
they are writing to a society of whom they pro-
fess not before to have heard; of whom, there-
fore, they ought certainly to have been particu-
larly cautious, because they could not possibly
know any thing of that which they here in-
quire after, the principles of its embers.
The letter proceeds—“ They do not tho-
‘ roughly comprehend how it would be possible
to incorporate with our society, three of your
members residing in Norwich, inasmuch as
it would be impossible to communicate to
them at that distance all our correspondence,
‘and they could not attend our committees,
where the business is transacted. If it is in-
formation you want, they will very readily
-alswer- any question you may put to them.
As to the object they have in view, they refer
you to their addresses.” I shall take notice
-of these addresses presently, of which my
learned friend reminds me that the counsel
for the prisoner have taken no notice what-
- ever; not one single observation has been
made upon those ardresses, though those ad-
are here expressly referred to, as con-
. taining the objects the society had in view.
“ As to the objects they have in view, they
_Tefer you to their addresses; you will therein
" see they mean to disseminate political know-
. ledge, and thereby engage the judicious part
. of the nation to demand a restoration of their
“rights in annual parliaments. The members
ot those parliaments, owing their election to
_ the unbought and nnhiiassed suffrage of every
citizen in possession of his reason, and not
incapacitated by crimes, they consider the
_ obtaining such parliaments to be the ind-
work of every necessary reform. To this,
therefore, they steadily adhere, and turn
themselves neither to the right, nor to the
left, to follow any other plan whatever. The
rules and orders of their society being so
plain and easy, that if they can get a majo-
rity of the nation to act as they do, the pro-
posed reform will effect itself. They look
upon the trifling differences that may have
arisen between the several societies to be of
‘very little consequence, and think they will
subside without any ways injuring the cause.”
' Those trifling differences consisted, as stated
‘ to them by the Norwich Society, in the ques-
tion, whether the societies meant to rest sa-
*tisfied with the duke of Richmond's plan
‘only; or, as the Friends of the People pro-
posed, still less violent measures ; or whether
it was their private design to rip up monarchy
by the roots, and place democracy in its
‘stead. These are the phe! differences ;
- and I observe that this word riffing is put in
the place of the word little. It, therefore,
, Was hot a word that was not considered.

Into small societies, each of which to choose a
delegate; the delegates when met to form the
committee, and transact the business of the
society ; afterwards let each delegate sapere
to his division the business so done, let him
admit fresh members, communicate fresh in-
telligence, promote and encourage political
discussion, or read to you such books as may
convey the instruction your weaker members
stand in need of.” Weak brethren, you will
recollect is a term that was very much in use
at one time; it meant a person that was not
risen to that height of enthusiasm which was
necessary for what was then called the good
cause—® but above all,” and then the word
“* Gentlemen,” is struck out—“ but above all
be careful to preserve peace and good order
among you; let nu dispute be carried to ex-
cess.” And here come the words which show
the meaning of the whole of this letter—The
question put to them was, whether it was
their private design to rip up monarchy by
the roots, and place democracy in its stead;
see what answer they give to that. Instead
of expressing their indignation at such an
idea: instead of saying, how could you ima-
gine that such was our intention: how could
you conceive that we had ever thought of
destroying that which is so essential to the
established constitution of this country, which
is indeed the very essence of its government ;
the essence of the government of this coun-
try being that it is a monarchy; a limited
monarchy; the great use of that monarchy
being that it reduces action to a single point,
it suppresses ambition, it contains every thing
within a just prerogative, and it gives us this
boast, that we never need fear a Robespierre,
or any dictator, because we have a king; be-
cause we have a person at the head of all, to
whose situation no person can aspire, but
whose powers are so limited by known and
bounded prerogatives, that he cannot pass
beyond them without exciting the jealousy of
all?

“Gentlemen, the answer is very curious ; it
is—“ Let no dispute be carried to excess;
leave monarchy, democracy, and even religion
entirely aside; never dispute on these topics.”
What! never dispute on the topics of mo-
narchy and democracy! on the propriety of
establishing the one or the other as the go-
vernment of a country, when persons were
considering what ought to be the reform to
be created in the governmont of the country !
“ Let your endeavours go to increase the
number of those who wish fora full and equal
representation of the people, and Icave toa
parliament so chosen to form plans for
remedying the existing abuses. Should they
then not answer your expectations, at the
year's end, you may choose others in their
stead.” .

Now, Gentlemen, this letter which chooses

to leave monarchy and democracy entirely
alone, in effect states a plan of clear and pure
democracy ; for it says— let your endea-
vours go to increase the number of those who
wish for a full and equal representation of
the people, and leave toa parliament so chosen”
—that is an entire parliament, so chosen by a
full and equal representation of the people—
an elective senate —for it can mean nothing
else— to form plans for remedying the exist-
ing abuses. Should they then not answer
your expectations, at the year’s end you may
choose others in their stead.”—This is not too
strong a comment which I have made upon
the words, “ those who wish for a full and
equal representation of the people,” and
“leave toa parliament so chosen;” because
if you will look at the address of the London
Corresponding Society, of the 6th of August
1792, they speak in clear, plain, and unequi-
vocal language of a parliament so chosen, as
that which is to accomplish all their purposes.
When they referred therefore in this letter to
their addresses—when in this letter they in-
serted this passage, the same idea pressed
upon their minds—namely, that by a full and
equal representation of the people, they meant
a parliament chosen as they there state, they
meant a parliament wholly elective, excluding
& House of Lords, and you will observe, that
in this address of the 6th of August 1792,
they describe it accordingly as the people’s
parliament. After taking notice of some
things which I shail have occasion to observe
upon presently, they say ‘“ numerous other
teforms will undoubtedly take place even in
the first session of a parliament so elected”—
that is of the whole parliament so elected—
“depending only upon their electors, undi-
vided by faction, uncorrupted by the minister,
and uninfluenced but by the public good.”
- Gentlemen, if their views went simply to
the representation of the people, in the Com-
mons House of Parliament, in what sense
could they possibly have used these words?
One paper retlects upon the other; it is clear
and plain, that that only, which I have stated,
could have been their intent. The letter pro-
ceeds, “To preserve peace and good order
among you, let no dispute be carried to ex-
cess. Leave monarchy, democracy, and even
religion entirely aside. Never dispute on
these tupics.”

Gentlemen, you have been told that the
prisoner never talked of the abolition of
meonarchy—never talked of the abolition of
the peerage—of the establishment of demo-
cracy—but all his language was only of the
duke of Richmond’s plan.—Grant that it was
80; what does it prove, but that he observed
the lesson which he taught to others, and
which perhaps this ver Tetter might teach
him the necessity of observing—“ to leave
monarchy, democracy, and even religion
entirely aside, never to dispute on these topics,
but to let his endeavours go only toencreasing


(te

the number of those who wished for a fil
and equal representation of the people,” -
cording to sense in which he used the
words; and “ leaving to a parliament so cw-
niente accomplish every object that
wis! a
The letter proceeds—“ The committee oa
you every assistance in their power, bi
request that your questions may relate chid:
to the methods of obtaining a reform in pe
liament.” Still observing the same sort ¢
conduct; do not put to us any such awkwar
questions, as whether we mean to be coskat
with the duke of Richmand’s plan only, «
whether it is our private design to np»
monarchy by the roots, and place demon
in its stead—those are awkward questicts;
we don’t like to write answers to such que
tions, but request your guesses may reise
chiefly to the methods of obtaining a reforw
in parliament. The letter concludes, “ Lic
yourselves we are friends to peace, notauarcr,
and well wishers to the Rights of Man, s¢
not so sanguine in our expectations, 3s
imagine those rights will be restored by ue
spontaneous consent of those who have 2
long deprived mankind of them.”
Gentlemen, you will observe that the lett:
from the Norwich Society, to which this letter
is an answer, concludes—“ I shall say «
more at present, but remain a friend to peac,
not to anarchy, a well wisher to the Rights o
Man, when obtained by consent.” The a
swer to it says, “ The London Corresponding
Society, are also friends to peace, not
anarchy, and well wishers to the Rights ¢
Man, yet not so sanguine in their expect
tions, as to imagine those rights will b
restored by the spontaneous consent of thove
who have so long deprived mankind of then.
Thus they expressly declare that their ness
are not of the peaceable description of thee
of the Norwich Boclety that they look tos
degree, at least, of force; to taking the &
vernment of the country, from those to whem
it has been intrusted, against their const;
and to ne it b ae mpauses epee

Gentlemery this, and numberless obt
letters of the same description, which I mp
observe upon, clearly and distinctly, %
seems to me, show the principles, the ve*s
and the intentions of the persons views
gaged in this transaction ; and the age
which they meant finally to-accomplish |

Suppose the Roman Catholics, in the

ae
™ of king Willlam, had set about a reform of
*' yeligion, and for that purpose had attempted
=» toassemble a convention, to act as a conven-
“2 tion of the le, for the reform of religion.
‘* Could you have had a doubt what sortof a

reform they meant to effect? Could you have
‘t had a doubt that they meant to establish
’ Popery ? Would a doubt of it have existed in
> the mutd of any man? And one great reason

' why you could not have had a doubt of it,
would be, the intolerant principles of Popery
+ though perhaps not of the Roman Catholic
religion, for I know they make a great dis-

« tinction, and a distinction in some degree well
< founded, between Papists and Roman Catho-
lics; but the great majority of Roman Catho-
lics in England, at least in former times, were

Papists, if they are not so now.

ntlemen, when we advert to the papers
which have been laid before you, we must
observe the same spirit of intolerance in these
societies. The French at this moment are as
intolerant in their political principles as the

Papists ever were in their religious princi-

ples. They willnot endure any other sort of go-
«  Yernment to exist in the world, but their own

form of government, because they say that
the government which the light of reason dis-
covers to man, ought to prevail all over the
world, and therefore they are in conscience
bound to promote it. Thus they hold the
same obligation upon conscience in matters
of politics, as the Papists deemed bindin,
upon conscience in matters of religion, an
which men hold to be binding in matters of
religion, because they think they ought toen-
deavour to prevail upon other men to take those
means for their final happiness, which they
themselves think the right means. This is a
natural impression upon the mind of man;
but applying that Feinciple to government is
perfectly new, and dangerous to the highest
degree; as it tends to the unsettling of eve
state whatever, because no two persons “il
agree upon the question, which. is the must
proper form of government? No two persons
perhaps ever perfectly agreed upon the sub-
Ject—and if persons by doen certain princi-
ples, and act upon the persuasion, that those
Principles are so clearly the result of the light
of reason, that they ought to be established
throughout the world, and that it is highly
meritorious to establish them throughout the
world, they act upon a principle of intolerance
which is just as great, and just as dangerous
as that of the Papists.

If therefore men, who in the years 1793,
and 1794, professed to consider no govern-
ment as lawful, but that which is established
on what they call the indefeasible Rights of
Man, as taught by the French, by Paine, and
by Barlow; and who professed to admire
every thing done in France—the extermina-
tion of treacherous royalty, aud all hereditary
distinction, and the confiscation of property ;
if such men_show a desire to fraternize with
persons of the same disposition; if such men


proceed to declare their intention to reform
the government of Great Britain, and take
steps for that purpose; and especially if the
steps they take are, endeavouring to assemble
a convention, which should act in the charac-
ter of a convention of the people, can any
thing but the destruction of the British go-
vernment be their end? Is it possible to ima-
gine, that they had any other object? For if
they should once have it in their power to ef-
fect any reform, can they, upon their own
principles stop short of that reform, which
they declare can alone constitute a lawful go-
vernment? It is not in the nature of things
gentlemer. If men once get the power to
make a reform, and lay it down as a principle
that the only just rule in forming a government,
is establishing the indefeasible and impre-
scriptible Rights of Man, with all their con-
sequences, the necessary result is, that the
moment they have the power in their hands,
they will do the whole. It is impossible to
doubt it. .
But it is not simply opinions, which the
Sean and those who were combined with
im have declared. They are not simply opi-
nions ; they are resolutions—resolutions to
act upon opinions. The societies, by their
addresses to the French Convention, have de-
clared, not only their opinion that the govern-
ment of this country ought to be republican
—not only their wish to make the government
of this country republican—but a resolution to
take measures to effect it. They resolve to °
make the government of this country repub-
lican—and? having so done, they in effect de-
clare, that they have entered into a complete
conspiracy against the government of the
country. For when men entertain opinions ;
when these opinions are followed by a wish
to carry them into effect, and a resolution to
attempt to accomplish that wish, they form a
conspiracy to do what they sowish to bedone,
Ido not know what is a conspiracy, if that is
not one. And these men have declared, not
only that such are their opinions, that such
is their wish, that such is their resolution, but
they have declared how they mean to accom-
plish that resolution ; namely, by means of a
convention of the people; and to establish
within this country, that sort of government
which would enable the French National
Convention to address a National Convention
in England, not as a constituent assembly,
simply, but as the governing power of this
country. .
Gentlemen, this has been the construction
which has been put upon acts combined with
opinions in other cases, What was the case
of Crohagan, which was mentioned by one of
my learned friends? A man declared his opi-
nion that the king ought to be killed; he de-
clared his wish to effect it; he declared his
resolution to effect it, if he could come at the
king. This he declared in Spain; and having
done so, he came to England. What was the
interpretation which a jury put upon all this ?

That he came to England for the purpose of
effecting that resolution which he had pre-
viously made; namely, @ resolution to kill
the king if he could come at him; and [
never heard the propriety of that decision of
the jury, in any degree reprobated; on the
con , it is always stated as an illustration
of aprinciple. But if he had declared, not
only, that he had formed the resolution to kill
the king, but that he inittended to do it bya
ah ge instrument, aud if he afterwards
ad provided that very instrument, how
strongly would the providing that instrument
have declared his purpose, and especially if
the instrument was of a particular construc-
tion, and such as is not ordinarily used ? You
would say, immediately, there could not be a
possibility of doubt of his purpose.

Now let us see how this Corresponding So-
ciety, and those who leagued with theinn—I
mean always the leading members—proceed-
ed to carry into execution, that purpose which
it seems to me they had clearly and expressly
demonstrated in these addresses to the Na-
tional Convention of France, and in the ad-
dresses of the London Corresponding Society,
to the people of England, which I shall pre-
sently mention, and in the letters which I
have observed upon.

Gentlemen, this is necessarily a deduction
of some length—but why is it so? because in
the nature of the thing, a resolution of this
kind could not be carried into effect in a mo-
ment. The only means by which it could be
effected was, by raising up a strong party in
this country to assist the conspirators in 0;
ia the completion of their intent. The
Revolution which has taken place in France,
peat from very small beginnings, to the

eight at which it has arrived. If we trace it
from its source, we shall find so much simi-
larity between what has happened there, and
the nature of the attempt made in this coun-
try, so far as they have gone, that I think we
shall perceive that the difference in the events
has arisen from difference in circumstances,
The ancient government of France had be-
come so odious to all ranks of the people, that
the opinion of the people, by which alone a
government can be supported, failing all at
once, the whole fabric fell together, almost
without a struggle; and it was obvious to
every one, that the meeting of the states-ge-
neral, in the year 1789, must produce a total
change ia the government of the country for
this plain reason, that the opinions of a vast
majority of the people were changed, with
Tespect to the Propriety of their existing go-
vernment; and whenever that shall be the
case in any country, the government of that
country cannot stand. The government of
Great Britain, on the contrary, has long been
the object of affection. We are in the habit
of considering, that it has produced, during a
long course of years, great public good. e
view it with all its faults, with all its imper-

fections ; but in the result, wishing, as all of

ere ee


us may honestly and probably do wish, togive
it as much of perfection as we can; and
though we are sorry to see many of the
abuses which prevail in it, yet we view it with
a great degreeof attachment, and of reverence.
e may be told, perhaps, gentlemen, and
so we have been told by writers upon this
subject, that all this is prejudice—prejudice!
Gentlemen! What are the opinions that we
form, upon the greatest number of subjects,
but such as may be deemed prejudices? Is
the mind of any man capable of reflecting, in
all its extent, upon every thing which comes
before its view. We are obliged, necessarily,
to take a great deal from the instruction of
others ; and that alone makes the important
difference between men of education, aud
men of no education. For education is, ina
great degree, the instilling what, in this powt
of view, may be considered as prejudices into
the minds of men. It is giving them the
benefit of the opinions of others; teaching
them, in early life, to rest satisfied with the
deductions which have brought the minds of
other men to certain points; to take them as
data, as principles, upon which they will p
ceed to reason, and to act, in their future
Men of great leisure, who have the opporta-
nity of contemplating subjects with more m-
nuteness, who are not engaged in busines
which any way distracts their attention, may
speculate upon various subjects, which
generality of men, in the busy world, cannot
possibly find leisure to contemplate, whateret
their situation in life may be. And a grest
majority of the people in every country, let
the nature of its government be what it msy,
must necessarily be so much employed in ob
taining the ordinary comforts of life, that it
is impossible for them to employ’
upon many subjects, with any very good ef
fect. This sort of fous it is that mio
ences the minds of the generality of the peo-
ple, with respect to the government of
country.—It possesses their a opinion —
Why? Because they have been taught ®
think it ought to possess their good opinies;
because it has been handed down to then
by their forefathers; that it has, fora grat
course of years, produced a greater portion of
happiness to the people of the country,
has been generally enjoyed under the gover
ment of other countries.—Why it has
so, very few men have the leisure, very few
men have the ability, to inquire. Perhaps
no man is capable’ of viewing it, in all its et
tent, and all its consequences ; seeing all the
minute parts of it, how they depend 00
upon the other, and how the moving or
tering of any particular part may effect, in ils
consequences, the whole. But we know that
the result of the whole, combined, in po
and practice, is, to a certain extent, good,

he first operation of those who conspired

Gentlemen, those who have imitated the

- proceedings of the French, in this country ;—
; and imitators, I call them, not because they
. make use of such a word as convention ;—
" jmitators, I call them, not because they talk

* of organizing, and appoint committees, for
- Various purposes, suc

as are made use of in

“ the French Assembly, but because they have
| proceeded directly upon the plan which has
' succeeded in France, in overturning the esta-
. blished government; . they have proceeded

upon the plan, which not only destroyed the

, government which existed previous to the

year 1789, but which has also destroyed that

“ constitution established in 1791, which wasthe
. Most popular constitution, in its form, that

ever was established in any country, with a
king at the head, and indeed more popular
than any constitution that ever was establish-
edin.any country whatever. For the king of
the French, as he was called, under that con-
stitation, had, in effect, very little authority,
except that most extravagant revenues un-

' questionably were assigned him, and some

particular prerogatives were given him, which
probably were intended, by those who framed
the constitution, to enable him to assume,
again, a certain degree of power, which they
might conceive to necessary for keeping
the whole together, and preventing the mass
from tumbling to pieces.

Gentlemen, Mr. Paine was fully aware of
the effect of all this. He tells you, in his
ig affection for this country, that, during

e American war, he had it in contempla-
tion, having transferred all his love for his na-
tive country to America, and declared himself
acitizen of the world ;—an expression which
tends to destroy all those attachments which
unite ustogether ;—a man who becomes what
he calls a citizen of the world, becomes, in a
certain degree, an enemy to his own country,
acting contrary to all those natural attach-
ments which unite us to the society in which
we have been educated, and which have hi-
therto been conceived as the best affections
of man, and which the principles of these
men lead directly to destroy.—Mr. Paine says,
he had conceived the idea of coming into this
country, during the American war, keeping

uiet till he could publish a book, which he

ght would have had the effect of over-

turning the government of this country.

This he mentions in a note, which shows
t


what was, in his mind, the consequence of t-
tacking the public opinion upon the govern-
ment of a country. He opens the introduc-
tion to the Second Part of the Rights of Man,
with observing, that, what Archimedes said
of the mechanical powers may be applied to
reason and liberty : “ Had we a place to stand
upon, we might raise the world.” He con-
ceived, that the propagation of his principles
was that standing P ¢, by means of which
he hoped to raise the world.

Gentlemen, you will observe, that an_im-
Pression was made on the minds of all these
men, that what had passed in France, in the
course of the years 1789, 1790, and 1791, was
8 prelude only to that which afterwards would
follow, long before the 10th of August, 1792 ;
and that the 10th of August, 1792, was the
glorious victory which completed their tri-
umph. They considered the world as in a
course: of revolutions; and, in the phrase
of Mr. Paine, that revolutions were the order .
of the day. The impression upon the minds
of these men, that the world was in a course
of revolutions, and that revolutions were the
order of the day, appears throughout almost
all their papers. You will find, upon exami-
nation, that they considered a revolution as
inevitable ; as that to which the nation must
finally come. They have been likewise taught
that the danger to which alone this sort of
revolutionary principle was liable (for so
Paine teaches them), was, the revolution
being attempted, before the principles upon
which revolutions ought to eee, and the
advantages to result from them, were suffi-
ciently seen and understood. Therefore, the
object of the works of Mr. Paine, Mr. Barlow,
and other publications of that description,
was, to show to the people of this country, the
principles upon which revolutions ought to
proceed, and the advantages to result from
them, in order that these being sufficiently
seen and understood, the rest might follow.

Gentlemen, for this purpuse @ variety of
pamphlets have been published, which have
been observed upon to you. These pam-
phlets have clearly and unquestionably for
their object, to destroy the opinion which the
people generally have of the excellence of the
British constitution, in all its parts, but more
especially in those two parts which the
counsel for the prisoner have said, it was the
object of the prisoner to retain. For these
books consider a House of Commons as a
thing tolerable only in comparison with a
House of Lords; anda monarchy they con-
sider as utterly destructive of all principle.
That there is something like principle ina
House of Commons, but nothing like it in the
other two.

Gentlemen, if the persons who were en-
gaged inthis did not mean to destroy this
government, why should they endeavour to
destroy the public opinion with respect to it?
If they meant to reform it, why should they
declare that no constitution existed? How

could they reform that ‘which did not exist?
The very declaration that there was no lawful
constitution existing in the country, was a de-
claration, that whatever they might like in
the present constitution, they meant to adopt
as part of a new establishment, and not as
part of the old establishment.

Gentlemen, the ease with which men are
induced to imagine that things are wrong in
the state, has often been observed upon ;
it has been said by an aneient and venerable |

- writer of our own country, that “He that
goeth about to persuade a multitude they are
Not so well governed as they ought to be, shall
never want attentive and favourable hearers ;
fos they know the manifold defects to which
every kind of regimen is subject ; but the se-

* cret lets and difficulties, which, in all public

proceedings, are innumerable and inevitable,
they have not ordinarily the judgment tocon-
sider.”—In this view, all these pamphlets
were written ; holding out, in the most glar-
ing colours, every thing that was an abuse ;
never once telling the people that they ought
to consider what were the secret lets and diffi-
eulties, which, ig all public proceedings, are
innumerable and inevitable, and which, there-
ought to make all persons extremely
cautious with respect even to the abuses of
government, because, without very minutely
attending to it, they may not be aware of
those secret lets and difficulties which occa-
sioned those very abuses, and which, perhaps,
are absolutely inevitable, from the nature of
things; from the constitutions of men; their
habits, prejudices, passions, and a variety of
other circumstances; all of which must be
considered, when people consider, not only
the constitution of the government, but the
administration of that government.

But, for the purpose of a systematic attack
‘upon the government of the country, it was
necessary that there should be some leader,
some head, to direct the whole.—Gentlemen,
what has been the wonderful effect of the so-
cieties which have been established in France;
I mean the Jacobin club, with its forty-four
thousand affiliated popular societies, which,
fora great length of time, really governed
France, and kept it in continual agitation ?—
The persons who were employed in this coun-
try, seem to me to have conceived the idea of
proceeding expressly upon the same principle.
—You will recollect a letter, which I cannot
immediately refer to, which says that the se-
veral societies ought to unite together, that
they might act in unison ; observing that it |
was by this means, that in France they finally
obtained their eud.—You will recollect the
letter to which I refer.—In the most express |
terms, it declares, that these clubs were '
formed upon the very principle of the Jacobin
club, and all those affiliated societies, and with
the same view and intent, to make the whole
mass co-operate as one entire body, in order
ae to accomplish the object of their
wishes.

One society, principally made use of for these
purposes, was the Society for Constitutional
Information, with respect to which, this
observation may be made:—It was a soci
originally consisting of gentlemen of respec-
table characters, and in lependent principles
—Some of them, perhaps, were soured by dis
content ; and might carry their discontent ts
great lengths; but they were men who wer
not likely to answer the puposes of the per.
sons who are the objects of the charge pow
before you. Thete were likewise
who got into this club, from time to time, and
began to use such language, and to condect
themselves in such a manner, that, yeu will
find, almost all the original members of the
club deserted it; and at last, as you will re-
collect from the proceedings of the society
which were read to you, about sixteen or se
venteen persons, appear to have been the
whole of the members who regularly attended,
frequently only five, six, or seven were pre-
sent; and the business was often transacted
with a great degree of inattention, There
were seldom more than sixteen or seventeen
present ; and if we advert to the persons pre-
sent upon the important transactions, we
shall find that a very few indeed, guided and
directed that club.—One constant attendant
was Mr. Horne Tooke.

You will easily perceive that such @ society
as this, was not that sort of society which
could be made to operate as a Jacobin club;
because a society of this description was net
an open society, it could not, from the natere
of its constitution, be made a popular society.
But people looked to the character which the
Society for Constitutional Information had
long had in the country ; for the world in ge-
neral did not know that their old res
members bad declined attending the society.
—WMr. Sheridan said, I think, that he had not
attended at the society for eight or ten years.
—As that, however, wasa thing not gene-
tally known to the world, the proceedings of
the Constitutional Society, signed by tbe se.
cretary, had with the world the ty
of the names of all those persons whe had
been members of the society.—It was neces-
sary to keep up the character and reputatice
of this society, but at the same time to form
another society, which should act in confor.
mity to the plan which had been laid ; and
with this view, it appears, that the London
Corresponding Society was established by the
prisoner, in conjunction with some other per-
sons, he taking upon himself the character of
secretary.

The consequence of this has been, that the
prisoner at the bar has stood as the clear leader
in all these transactions. . By header, aay

pears com
forward in all the Gannichons, and he is in-
volved therefore in all. He became afterwards,
by association, a member of the Society for
Constitutional Information. oo
Gentlemen, the plan and constitusiom of

this London Corresponding Society was admi-
rably calculated for the effect which it was in-
tended to have. Its name imports that the
object of it was, to correspond with all other
societies of the like description; and an imn-
portant object of this society was, to unite, by
means of that correspondence, all the country
societies with this society in London, and
with the Society for Constitutional Intorma-
tion; so that they might move in one bond
of union, in the manner recommended by that
letter which I have mentioned to you.

This society was extremely popular in its
constitution. Any body might be admitted a
member of it, of any description. The sums
collected from the members were very small,
They were formed into divisions; and when
the members amounted to a certain number,
they were to be divided again, for the purpose
of diffusing their meetings more generally over
the whole town.—They were to have from
each division a delegate; the delegates
formed a committee of delegates; and that
committee of delegates was to be guided by
the committee of correspondence; for, as
their business was principally correspondence
the Commitee of Correspondence necessarily
had the management of almost every thing;

_ and that committee of correspondence finally
became the Conmittce of Secrecy, which I
before observed upon.

This society have, in three publications
which they have given to the world, and
which the gentlemen on the other side have
notin any degree observed upon, declared
their principles and vbjects, so far as they
Ahought it proper and sate to declare them.
You will recollect the manner in which they
expressed themselves in the answer to the
Norwich letter; and I must beg you will al-
ways have in view the answer to that Nor-
wich letter. It is akey to all their language.
It directs the Norwich Societies to leave mon-
archy and democracy, and all disputes upon
that subject alone; but to look forward to one
distinct object—the obtaining a fulland equal
representation of the people in parliament,
leaving to a parliament s0 chosen, to carry into
execution the rest of their views, ifthey should
not be able immediately to carry them into
execution. Their intention, therefore, was, to
keep as much as possible out of their publica-
¥ons, any thing about monarchy or demo-
cracy ; but, at the same time, tu express them-
selves in such a manuer as should convey
completely, to those who chose to understand
them, all that they meant.

The first address of the London Correspon-
ding Society was dated the 2nd of April, 1792,
but which the evidence has clearly shown you,
was concerted between the prisoner and some
other persons, ata much earlier period. It
begins thus—“ Assured that man, individual
man, may justly claim liberty as his birthright
we naturally conclude, that, as a member of
society, it becomes his indispensable duty to
Preserve inviolate that liberty, for the benefit



of his fellow citizens, and of his and their pos-
terity.—For, as in associating he gave up cer
tain of his rights in order to secure the pos-
session of the remainder, and! voluntarily
yielded up only as much as was necessary for
the general good, so he may not barter away
the liberties of his posterity, nor desert the
common cause, by tamely and supinely suffer-
ing to be purloined from the people, of whom
he makes a part, their natural and unalienable
rights of resistance (o oppression, and of shuring
in the government of their country 3 without
the fail and uninterrupted exercise of which
rights, no man can, with truth, call himself or
his country free.”

You will recollect, that, throughout every
one of their papers, they have uniformly de-
clared, that they considered the existing go-
vernment of this country as an usurpation,
and as an oppression.—W hen, therefore, they
declare their right of resistance to oppression,
they declare their right of resistance to the
existing government, which ri have de-
clared to be an oppression; and all their pro-
ceedings are in direct conformity to that de-
claration. For the proceedings of the Scotch
convention, and the resolutions of the twen-
tieth of January, 1794, at the Globe-tavern,
go upon this principle—-the natural and un-
alienable right of resistance to oppression—
So that they have only to call any act on the
part of government oppression, and then, de-
claring their natural and unalicnable right of
resistance to oppression, they declare their
unalicnable right to resist that particular act.
—They also declare their unalienable right
of sharing in the government of their country
—making use of the word government, as
will be found in all their publications, instead
of the expression in the duke of Richmond’s
letter—“ sharing in the choice of those per-
sons who are to make the laws by which they
are to be governed.” — The change is ex-
tremely remarkable, and is, in fact, a key to
the whole.

Then they resolve expressly, “ That every
individual has a right to share in the govern-
ment of that suciety of which he is a mem-
ber.”—And their fourth resolution is, “ That
the people of Great Britain are not effectually
represented in parliament,” not confining
their resolution to the House of Commons ;
and though certainly it is capable of that con-
struction, yet that is not the natural construc-
tion of the words.——Their seventh resolu-
tion is—“ That a fair, equal, and impartial
representation can never take place till all
partial privileges are abolished :” — which
seems a clear declaration of their mcaning.—
For their first resolution is, “ ‘That every indi-
vidual has a right to share in the government
of that society of which he is a member, un*
less incapacitated ;” which share in the
government they could not possibly have,
unless they had a voice at Icast in the elee-
tion of the persons who are to administer
that government. — They fourthly resolve

4akh

—* That the people of Great Britain are not
effectually represented in parliament.’—And
then they say, “That, in consequence of a
partial, unequal, and therefore inadequate re-
presentation, together with the corrupt me-
thod in which representatives are elected,
oppressive taxes, unjust laws, restrictions of
liberty, and wasting of the public money,
have ensued.”—And, in their seventh reso-
lution, they say, “ That a fair, equal, and im-
Partial representation of the people in parlia-
ment, can never take place until all partial
privileges are abolished ;”—which partial pri-
vileges necessarily include the existence of
the peerage as a part of the parliament.

These resolutions, thercfure, when attended
to and attcnded to purticularly with the
comment which they themselves make
upon them in their letters, and other
proceedings, amount to a clear resolution,
“ That every individual has a right to a
share in the government of the country;”
—meaning a share in the election of those per-
sons by whom that government is to be adminis-
tered, legislative and executive ; and the fourth,
sixth, and seventh resolutions, taken toge-
ther, clearly show that they meant to have a
wholly elective parliament.

Gentlemen, their second address was pub-
lished on the 24th of May, 1792: and in that
address they state the sort of test, as it has
been called, which they proposed to admi-
nister to every member, upon his admission.
Now, the only ground upon which tests of
any kind can possibly be supported is, that,
in the administration of the government of a
country, it is necessary, for the safety of that
government, that the persons who compose
the actugl administration of the government,
should not be adverse to the principles upon
which that government is formed :—That is |
the only ground, as it strikes me, upon which
any test whatever can be supported. — But
a test in a society which was to have for its
object the fair discussion of the principles
of government, seems the most extraordinary
thing imaginable.—Men are to enter into a
society in which they are to declare what are
their principles upon government, and -yet
the society pretends to be formed for the
purpose of discussing those principles,

The questions to be put to the members |
before their admission, and to which they are
to answer in the affirmative, are, “ First,—
Are you convinced that the parliamentary
meprescnialion of this country is at presentin- |
adequate and imperfect?”

“Secondly, are you thoroughly persuaded
that the welfare of these kingdoms requires ,
that every person of adult years, in possession
of his reason, and not incapacitated by crimes,
should have a vote for a member of parlia-
ment?”

“ Thirdly, will you endeavour, by all justi-
fable means, to promote such reformation in
parliament ?”

Here, gentlemen, they bind, at once, all


[125

their members to one certain object, aud »
using all justifiable means ;— justifiable, »
you will observe, gentlemen, is a very lar
word—* all justifiable means to promote sua
a reformation in parliament.”—Is it, the,
to be conceived, that the persons who became
members of this society—I mean those who
were the leading and directing members of 2
—meant that there should be, in any conve
tion which they might assemble of the pec-
ple, a full and fair. discussion of the subjet—
that the present existing constitution of the
country, in all, or any of its parts, should be
tried in a fair deliberation—that the will aad
wishes of the people should be taker yxa
the subject ?—They could not possibly maa
any such thing—they meant to establits
tyranny of their own clubs—they meant
establish these as assumed and positive pat
ciples, not to be disputed—and which aloe
were to govern all the deliberations of that
Convention of the People, as they call it
which they proposed to assemble. .

The report of their committee of consti
tion states exactly the same resolution, wit
this variation only, that the words, “ the wh
fare of these kingdoms,” are omitted:—Why
these words were omitted I think it is ox
very difficult to discover, when one recollecs
that in one of the letters which was
from some society in the country, and |
was afterwards published, the word kingéms
was altered for country, in two difierest
places.

Gentlemen, it is also clear, from that repot
of the committee of constitution, to
have just referred, that the persons
composed this society, were fully aware, thi
the opinions of a great majority of the pe
ple of the country were not with
For one of their resolutions is, that 0
majority, however great, can justly ce

rights. Whenever it is attempted, the 3

‘Hen, HE o. these civil rights? W y the
fourth resolution is this, “ The civil rights

sons by whom those laws are to be adminis

' There they have expressly told you what they

mean by the right of every individual to 4
shure in the government of that society of whi
he isa member. It is not simply an equally
of voice in making laws, but likewise in th
choice of persons by whom those laws are to ke
administered.—Does the spirit of the British
constitution, in any degree, permit the choie
by the pcople of the persons by whom te
laws are to be administered? Can a moe
clear and explicit declaration of an intented
to form a republic be made than this; “t!
the civil rights of every individual, are q
lity of voice in the making of laws, and the
choice of persons by whom these laws at

-7

be administered; that every person has a
right to exercise these rights, thatno majority,
however great, can justly deprive the minority
of any part of these rights, and that, where-
ever it is attempted, the social bond is broken,
and the minority have a right to resist.”
. _I do not wonder that my learned friends
- did not make any observation upon this pa-
per—It is impossible to make any effectual
observation upon it, for the benefit of the
prisoner, because the meaning is clear and
plain, beyond the possibility of doubt. Here
are persons declaring a principle so wild, that
if it were to prevail, it would be impossible
for any government to exist—It has generally
been conceived, that it is a very strong thing
to say that the majority have a right to alter
the constitution of a government, at least
without very strong necessity for it. A num-
‘ber of people are assembled in.a country,
whose whole habits, and connexions, lead
them to wish to remain in that country, and
they are assembled upon certain terms of as-
sociation, which forms their constitution.
Every individual has a sort of sacred right to
the observance of the terms of that associa-
tion; a right, at least as sacred as his right
to the property which he possesses.—If it be
his wish to continue to live under that con-
stitution, it is injuring him as materially and
as essentially to take away that constitution
of government, as to take away his property.
Undoubtedly cases of necessity may arise, in
which that right must ‘be invaded, as rights
of property, and every other right must be
invaded, in cases of necessity—even the right
which every man has to his own life—you
must remember the case which is commonly
put, of two men being upon a plank in the
sea, and the plank proves capable of support-
ing only one of them. It is said, that the
stronger would be justified perhaps in the
-—-* I confess, gentlemen, waa overcome
with the dreadful alternative to which that
man must be reduced—It is commonly ob-
served, that it would be justifiable for the
stronger, in that situation, to push the weaker
from the plank, for his own preservation.
But, gentlemen, if we feel so much when a
man is reduced to such a dreadful situation,
and feel that nothing but absolute necessity
can justify the act which he does—what can
justify men, who without a very strong neces-
sity, shall attempt to disturb the established
poverrunentt of any country, in which any
large proportion of the in
retain.the government so established ?—but
what shall we say to men who carry the prin-
ciple to this length—not content with deny-
ing that even a large majority of the country
ought not to alter the established government

of it, against the. consent of the minority, ;

without extreme necessity — but asserting
that no majority, however great, can justly





deprive the minority, of any part of their civil
tights; that whenever it is attempted, the
social bond is broken, and the minority have
a right to resist; and assuming at the same
time, as one of those civil rights, the right of
equality of voice in the making of laws, and in
the choice of persons by whom those laws are
to be administered?

Is not this a declaration, clear and plain,
that they conceive they have an unquestion-
able right to resist any government which is
not a republican government, founded upon
their principles of universal representation ;
and that any other government is so unlawful
that they are not only not bound to give it
support, but that they have a right to resist
it to the utmost of their power, and in any
manner in which they think fit to resist it?
this is a principle which teaches rebellion
against every government not founded upon
their plan, and yet | am told that men who
hold such principles, who come to solemn re-
solutions upon them, are men who have a
perfect reverence for the monarchy of this
country, for the hereditary peerage, for every
part of the government of the country, ex-
cept the corrupt representation in the House
of Commons.

Gentlemen, the address of this society of
the 6th of August, 1792, proceeds exactly
upon the same principles; and when you
consider these addresses and resolutions in the
report of the committee of constitution, I
think you cannot have a doubt in your own
minds that every thing which tends the other
way in any part of their publications, is what
the attorney-general represented it to be, a
mere veil to cover their designs; but so thin,
so thread-bare, and so tattered, that the na-
ked limb is starting outevery moment. This
address of the 6th of August 1792, begins
with those lines from Thomson which my
learned friend read so well. Who will dis-
pute any one principle which it contains?
and yet, if passages are to be taken from
books, and applied to such purposes, the best
books may be perverted to the worst of pur-

ses. No book has been more perverted to
Pad purposes than the bible.

This address of the Corresponding Society
to the inhabitants of Great Britain, on the
subject of a parliamentary reform, begins
thus— Uninfluenced by party pique, or sel-

| fish motives, no ways affrighted at the frowns

of power—not in the least awed by the evidently
hostile preparations of « much alarmed aristo-
cracy.’—Here conveying, for the first time,
that idea which you afterwards see developed
with-so much success, and which was to end
in arming their own bars yon will observe
the idea is here completely developed—“ not
in the least axed by the hostile preparations of
a much alarmed aristocracy—we, the London

Corresponding Society, united with a view of
obtaining a thorough parliamentary reform,
| anxiously demand your serious and most col-
lected attention, to the present vitiated state

of the British government. We entreat you
to examine coolly, and impartially, the nume-
rous abuses that prevail therein, their des-
tructive consequences on the poor, and their
evil tendency on all: as also the rapidity with
which these abuses increase both in number
and magnitude.”

Gentlemen, I think you will observe, that
in all the addresses, and in all the papers of
these societies, there has been a great attempt
to excite the poor to be of their side ; to inte-
rest the poor in their tavour, and to represent
the poor as the great objects of their attention;
to bold out, that their wishes were principally
for the relief of the poor—Mr. Paine’s works,
have many passages to this effect; and in
Various other parts of this cause you must
have observed the suggestion of the same
ideas. In one of the letters which I shall by-
and-by observe upon (a letter of Margarot’s)
the distinction is drawn for the very same
purpose, between the poor and the rich—
where he says “the rich are arming, why
should not the poor do the same ?”

This address of the Corresponding Society,
having urged the various abuses, prevailing
in the British government, proceeds; “ we
next submit to your examination, an effectual
mode of putting a stop to them, and of there-
by restoring to our no less boasted than im-
Paired constitution, its pristine vigour and
purity ; and we thereuntg warmly solicit the
Junction of your efforts with ours.

“ This great end, however, we believe at-
tainable solely by the whole nation, deeply
impressed with a sense of its wrongs, uniting,
and as it were with one voice demanding, of
those 10 whom for a while it has entrusted its
sovereignty, a restoration of annually elected
parliaments, unbiassed, and unbought elec-
tions, and an egual representation of the whule
body of the people.” You will recollect that
these are words frequently made use of—
words which admit of different interpretation,
——But gentlemen, it strikes me that this
very address contains completely that inter-
pretation which the society themselves meant
should be put upon the words,

Having proceeded to state the situation of
the different persons of this country, and es-
pecially the poor, they say, “ Such being the
forlorn situation of three fourths of the nation
how are Britons to obtain information ant
redress? = Will the Court — will ministry
aftord either ?—will parliament grant them ?
—will the nobles, or the clergy, ease the peo-
ple’s suffering? No—experience tells us, and
proclamations confirm it, that the interest
and the intention of power, are combined to
keep the nation in torpid ignorance.”

Gentlemen, you will observe how this is
echoed back in all the letters from the coun-
try societies. For men, who use such ex-
pressions, to state, that they are men who
have it in their view to obtain, from the exist-
ing legislature of the country, that alteration

an the constitution which they propose, seems


[1240

to me to be perfectly absurd. I would ob-
serve too, here, upon one part of this address,
where it notices proclamations; because ut
has been urged, by the counsel for the priso
ner, that, those who have been engaged in
these transactions, were never made aware
that they were acting improperly. Why,
gentlemen, in that jamation which is bere
Noticed, and in a variety of other acts of
vernment, it was clearly and expliciuy
clared to them, that they were (&king steps
which might lead to the most dangerous con-
sequences. It was pointed out to them, that
those who had the direction of government,
conceived that the safety of the state was in
danger; that there was a conspiracy formed
to subvert the constitution of the country;
that a reform in the representaticn of parks
ment was 4 mere pretence; and that the ob-
ject of the conspirators went infinitely beyond
that. This they were distinctly told, over
and over again, in a variety of ways. Even
the various associations, as they term them,
of the rich, showed that the rich apprehended
the same danger? that they conceived there
was an intention to make that sort of alters
tion ia the constitution of the government
which must be subversive of its principles,
and destructive to their rights of property.

Under these circumstances, oughta society,
who had only in view a reforin in parliament,
by clear and specific regulations, applying
merely to the House of Commons, ought they
to have expressed themselves in such lap
guage?

They proceed :—“ The only resource then,
friends and fellow citizens, will be found m
those societies, which, instituted with a view
to the public good, promote a general instruc
tion of our rights as men, expose the abuses
of those in power, and point out the only com
Stitutional, the only effectual means of for
warding a public investigation, and obtaining
acom plete redress for a people, in whose cre-
dulous good nature originated their preseat
difficulties.” Clearly and directly pointing to
that convention, which has since been attempt-
ed to be established.

Gentlemen, this address likewise pointsout
the very same thing which is noticed in the
answer to the Norwich letter which indeed
refers to thisaddress. The address says,“ Yet,
fellow citizens! numerous as our grievances,
andclose rivetted as weighty the shackles on our

eedom, reform one alone, and the others will
all disappear. If we once regain ar annually
elected parliament, and that parliament to be
fairly fie by all, the people will again share
in the government of their country, and thet
then unbought, unbiassed euffrages must ut
doubtedly select a majority of honest mem-
bers.”

Gentlemen, the answer (you will obeerve)
to the Norwich letter, says,—‘ Leave Momer-
chy, Democracy, and even Religion entirely
aside; never dispute on these topics ; let
endeavours go to increase the number of

who wish for a full and equal representation
of the people, and leave to a parliament so cho-
sen, to form plans for remedying the existing
abuees.” The letter, therelDre’ to the Nor-
wich Society, commenting on this Address,
shows you what they meant. It shows you,
that they meant, in their words, to leave Mo.
narchy and Democracy alone; but to hold
out that. which they thought, under the cover
of language, they mi y hold out ; and,
at the same time, keeping clearly in view the
destruction of Monarchy, and the establish-
ment of Democracy, of which you cannot pos-
sibly have a shadow of doubt, when you con-
sider the terms of that letter, the terms of
this address, and the particular passages which
Thave read from the report of the committee
of constitution.

_ Gentlemen, there are two things contained
in this address, which struck me in a very ex-
traordinary manner. One is, the description
of what they conceived such a parliament
(an elected parliament) as they describe,
would do, when assembled. They say, that
such a parliament, “ Finding that a most ex-
truordinary waste of public money had taken
place under the different pretences of places,
Pensions, contracts, armaments, subsidies, se-
cret service money, éxc. our honest and ati-
nual parliament would, after narrowly scruti-
nizing the same, retrench every sum need-
lessly or wickedly laid out.” You will ob-
serve, this passage refers to a waste of public
money, which Aad taken place, and says, this
elected parliament would retrench every sum
needlessly or wickedly laid out—not that it
would prevenit, in future, improper expenses.
Gentlemen, I leave to you to make the com-
Ment upon that passage.

The other passage which particularly struck
me, is also a passage which speaks for itself,
and which I take to he exactly of the same
description as that which I last mentioned. —
“The people’s parliament finding, that, under
Varlous pretences, grants of common land had
been obtained by sundry persons, no ways to
the benefit of the community, but very much
to the distress of the pour, the same would be
s00n restored to the public, and the robbed pea-
sant again enabled annually to supply his dis-

family with an increased quantity of
bread, out of the profit arising from the liber-
ty regained, of grazing a cow, two or three
Sheep, ora brood of geese thereon.”

What can that possibly mean, but that all
those commons, which, under the gencral
cousentof persons interested, under the autho-
rity of acts of parliament, or in any other
Manner, have been enclosed, improved, and
divided, should, under pretence of restoring
the rights of the poor, be taken from the pre-
sent proprietors, and divided amongst those
poor, for the perpese of engaging them in the
Party? If it be possible to give any other con-
“truction to that paragraph, I wish you to do
ts but my mind is incapable of giving it any
other construction, and I think there cannot


be an idea more destructive to private pro-
perty. For under the same pretence, the
whole property in land of every person in the
country, might be destroyed. I cannot form
a calculation of the immense quantity of land,
which, within even the last twenty years, was
common land, and is now become separate
and enclosed, ee the faith of which inclo-
sures, persons have laid out large sums of
Money in improvements and bui! dings; and,
generally speaking, those who had rights of
common, had their rightscompensated in some
way or other. Whatever injustice may have
been, in particular instances (supposing any
such to have been), if once an attempt is made
to unsettle rights gained in such a manner,
and so established, all right of property is ne-
cessarily in danger. If you once attack the
principles on hick rights of property have
been established, you must go on till you will
destroy all right of property, and do exactly
what has been done in France. For there,
under the pretence of the rights of the public,
an immense quantity of property, which had
been granted, from a vast distance of time, by
the crown, to individuals—as half the estates
in this country are, perhaps, held under grants
from the crown, although, perhaps, those
pant cannot be actually traced—was taken
tom the possessors, and given to the publie.
The first French National Assembly, that
Constituting Assembly which acted in many
cases very properly, was guilly of the gross
injustice of taking into the hands of the public,
large quantities of land, from great numbers
of persons, which had been purchased and ac-
quired in various ways, because they said, the
lands had been originally improperly granted.
—Here the expression is, “ improper grants
land” which may easily be applied to lands
formerly granted by the crown, and indeed to
the title of every person’s estate. This lure
is held out, unquestionably, for the purpose
of gaining the poorer sort of people.

These are two striking passages in this ad-
dress.—One referring to a subject, upon which
I make no comment, but leave it to you to
make acomment.—Upon the other I have
ventured to make a comment.—It seems to
me, that, by it, the title to all property is put
in hazard, and I will call to your attention a
part of the evidence which applies particularly
to the subject. I allude to that part of Ly-
nam’s evidence, with respect to the divisions
in Spitalfields. 1 only wish you to bear that
in mind now,—I mean particularly to notice
it hereatter,—to bear in mind the relation
which that evidence has to this passage. You
will recollect, the Spitalfields divisions were
considered as likely to produce as many mem-
bers as all the then existing members of the
society, and they were to be supported by as-
sistance from the other divisions, because
they were considered us persons of that de-
scription to whom the smal] subscriptions
that were to be made, ofa penny a week, by
other members of this society, might be in-

convenient; and then judge, whether that
which I have suggested, was not a part of the
general plan.

Gentlemen, you will also recollect, that, if
what Lynam stated upon that subject is un-
true, there could have been no difliculty what-
ever in contradicting bim; and, therefore,
whatever reflections may be thrown upon
him, or upon spies, or any other persons, you
must believe that to be true; because, when
@ person is accused of having concurred in a
transaction, by evidence, which is capable of
being contradicted by a great number of per-
sons, and not one of them is called to contra-
dict that evidence, you must give credit ne-
cessarily to the accusation; and its not being
contradicted, when it might be so easily con-
tradicted, if false, gives it a confirmation be-
yond all doubt.

This address statcs, that, ‘“‘ Numerous other
reforms would undoubtedly take place, even
in the first session of a parliament, so elected,
dependent only on their electors, the people, un-
torn therefore by faction, undivided by party,
uncorrupted by ministry, and uninfluenced but
by the public good.”—A_ passage which, as I
before observed, is utterly inconsistent with
the existence of a House of Peers; referring
to a parliament, which is described as wholly
elected in the manner mentionedin this paper,
and as dependent only on their electors, the
poerls, the very object of the House of Peers

eing to have a middle body in the constitu-
tion of the government, which should not be
so elected, but being of a different descrip-
tion, should form a barrier between each of
the two other powers, the King and the Com-
mons, and keep the balance even between
both, as one or other may preponderate.

It is a remarkable thing in the history of
the constitution of this country, that the time
when the liberties of the country were most
in danger, from the over-bearing influence of
the crown, was immediately after the close of
the civil wars between the Houses of York
and Lancaster, when almost all the great
families in the country had been extinguished
by the accidents attending those wars; many
falling in the field, and on the scaffold, and
many being ruined by confiscations; so that,
according to my recollection, when Henry
7th ascended the throne, there remained only
about thirty peers in the parliament. And
he, wisely, seeing the advantage which this
accident gave him, scarcely added at all to
the number of peers, the consequence of
which was, that there was not that middle
body to stand between the crown and the
people, and all the dangerous exercise of
power, every thing which Ted to that which

. was afterwards done by Charles ist, will be
found to have originated in the government
of Henry 7th, aud bis son Henry 8th, whilst
the peerage of the country was in that situa-
tion, that, from the number of the members
of which it was composed, they did not form
that barrier which it was intended they should
‘orm. ‘

Gentlemen, I have now, at.a length to
which I certainly did not intend to go, com
mented upon the establishment of the London
Corresponding Society, upon its addresses,
and upon its constitution ; and it seems to
me, that this alone would be very sufficient
to show, that the object and the intention,
that the formed resolution fer I think we do
it injustice when we call it intention, o
opinion, or conception), that the formed rav-
lution of these societies, that is, of the leadng
members of them, was, to establish, in ths
country, a democratical form of government;
a form of government more democratical than
that which ever existed in any other counuy
—unless we conceive that it exists now i
France—utterly incompatible with, and ther-
fore necessarily destroying, the monarchal
part of our government; and therefore, als,
a clear demonstration of a tonspiracy »
depose the king; and any act, taken in pr
suance of that conspiracy, is unquestionably
an act of high treason.

Gentlemen, in the course of these transr-
tions, there was one very artful proceeding;
which was, I believe, ohserved upon by the
attorney-general. The society for Corstte
tional Information met every Friday; the
delegates of the Corresponding Society me
every Thursday. The advantage was, tx
Society for Constitutional Information were
to hold themselves up as persons of reset:
able situations; all violent resolutions wer
therefore to begin, either in the country 9
| cieties, or in Scotland, or they were to
in the London Corresponding Society—
committee of delegates of the London Ca-
responding Society, came to resolutions 0
the Thursday, which, on-the Friday, they

generally communicated to the Society ©
, Constitutional Information. And here §
| another strong'proof, how perivetly aristocrabt
‘the government of this democratical soaely
was. For a measure was to be resolved up2.
first, by their secret committee ; then
to the committee of delegates, and
|upon there; which committee of delesies
necessarily acted, in a certain degree, bhodly
upon the reports of the committee of com
pondence, because they did mot know all he
| correspondence that passed ; being adopt
| there, they were not to wait for an adophod
‘of it’ by the rest of the members of te
society ; it was to be reported, indeed, # the
different division meeti but that might
not have happened till the resolution |
| taken place; because. those division

were upon the different days, which were mast
convenient for the different divisions to me
and yet, on the Friday, without any referee
to the division meetings, the resolutions
to be carried to the Constitutional Society, #
the proceedings of the London Co
Society. wa

Gentlemen, that letter from Sheffield, oe
I before adverted to, I now see is dale
15th of October, 1792; from the editer


Patriot ; and there, speaking of the establish-
ment of several socicties, it says—“ We beg
leave also to throw in our mite of commenda-
tion, of the laudable spirit which you have
evinced in your intention to address the
National Convention of France, and ho
sincerely, that your example will be followed
by all the societies in the two kingdoms;
Ireland having already set the example”—
then it says ‘ we hope your society will also
give them” (a particular society, which is
named, the Stockport Society) “ your sanction,
advice, and support; as it will be in vain for

’ the friends of reform, to contend with the
tremendous host of enemies they have to
encounter,”—clearly showing, that they con-
sidered that avery large propurtion indeed
(and some of the other letters expressly stat-
ing, that a vast majority) of the people, were
against them. It goes on—“ We clearly
foresee, that Scotland will soon take the lead
of this country”—(I wish you, gentlemen, to
observe this) “ and conceive it will be neces-
sary to take the greatest care, that an uni-
versal communication should be constantly
kept up, between the several societies, how-
ever distant, and that all should determine to
act upon the same principle, and move to-
gether, as near as may be in regular and
activeunison. ’Twas by this method, France
becume so thoroughly united, and we ought
never to lose sight of it.”

Now, can any government subsist, which
has within its bosom a number of societies
acting as a corporate body upon those princi-
ples? What, gentlemen, 18 a government,
anda state, but a corporation ?—It isa num-
ber of men, assembled by certain constitutions
of union, by which those who are of them-
selves individuals, are enabled to act as one
body. When therefore a society is established,
and that society puts itself under particular
Tegulations, that society, to a certain extent,
though not bound in the same manner as a
Corporation created by the lawful government,
1s in effect a corporation ; and when a number
of societies unite themselves in the manner
here Proposed, they are a union of distinct
corporations, Corporations created by the
Constitution and government of the country,
acting under the authority of that constitu-
tion, are subordinate states. The East India

Ompany, for instance, is a corporation, by
means of which our possessions in the East
Indies, to a certain degree, are governed.
That is a corporation, acting in subordination
to the great corporation of this country;
which, lord Coke says, is composed of King,
Lords, and Commons, of which the King is
thehead. He calls it, expressly, the great
Corporation of this country. Then here, upon
the principle of incorporation, are a great
Humber o! societies, united together, for the
Purpose of moving together in regular active
unison ; for the purpose of furming themselves
Into one state, which should act together, upon
one principle; a sort of combination of states,


like the United States of America, which still
have one regular constitution, which regulates
the whole government. A country may bear a
corporation or state within it, which is in
avowed subordination to it, such as the diffe-
rent corporations in this kingdom ; because it
has a power to regulate their actions by the
proceedings of the courts of justice. If the
exceed their power in any degree, it calls
them in question, and they may, if they go to
certain lengths, forfeit the privileges granted
to them. Such corporations are completely
within the power of the government, and are
capable of existing consistently with the
safety of it. But such corporations as these,
cannot exist in any government, with safety
to that government. It is, imperium in im-
perio, which is inconsistent with any govern-
ment. This was the very principle upon
which the National Assembly in France, in
1791, passed a decree against the Jacobin
clubs, which unfortunately for that country,
was never put in execution.

We object to these socicties, “ you are
acting as a corporation—you are taking upon
yourselves the firmness, union, and manner
of acting, which belongs to a corporate}bady,
which makes you therefore a state within a
state, and renders the existence of your so-
ciety, totally incompatible with public peace.”

The celebrated specch made by one of the
most distinguished members of the French
constituent assembly, Mons. D’André, a man
of considerable ability, states this in so clear
and plain a light, that it must bring convic-
tion to the mind of every man, that the go-
vernment of a country cannot exist, if there
subsist within it, such a set of associated and
affiliated societies, acting as a corporate body,
in opposition to that government, in the
manner in which these socicties proposed
to do.”

In all these transactions, the prisoner un-
questionably has borne a very distinguished
part; and you will find that his letters, if you
take the trouble of referring to them, cer-
tainly show his privity with every part of the
transaction. A privity which must necessa-
tily also be inferred from his situation of
secretary, with every part of the transactions.

Gentlemen, you recollect a letter of the
prisoner, to Mr. Vaughan, of the 9th of
April, 1792, in which he particularly states,
in what manner he conceived the minds of
the people were to be acted upon; the man~
ner in which they were to be allured and de-
luded; and advises Mr. Vaughan to collect
some choice flowers from several publications
which he refers to. You will recollect, also,
that the gentleman to whom that letter was
addressed, although present in court, has
not been called to explain any of the transac-
tions which have taken place. That letter
was very early in the transactions stated tu
you, and shows most clearly, and plainly,
that the prisoner was at the very foundation
and root of every thing—He was not a per-


f0n who was deluded and led away—He was | send a deputation to that meeting, I havem

one whose whole heart was in the cause, and
who was contriving all the delusions which
are imputed to the persons who were con-
cerned in these transactions.

These things having been done, and the,

people having been by such means consi-
derably set against the constitution establish-
ed in the country, the leaders of these socie-
ties began to consider what measures they
should take. There had been for some time
in Scotland, a number of societies, which had
been acting upon the same principles, and
holding a correspondence with the London
Corresponding Society; and these societies
in Scotland had formed a meeting, called a
Convention of Delegates, which had met
early in the year 1793, and had then ad-
journed, I think to November 1793. These

ople, when they originally met, appear to
Fave had exactly the views which were
steted by my friend who last addressed you,
as the views of the London Societies.—They
did not assume to be a Convention of the
People; they described themselves as a meet-
ing of delegates of the different socicties as-
Sociated for the purpose of ong a par-
liamentary reform—they met—they did their
business—they dispersed and adjourned to
meet again in November.

During this interval, you will observe that
avery private and particular correspondence
took place. There isa letter from Skirvin
to Hardy, of the 25th of May, 1793.—I shall
have occasion to observe something more
upon the subject; but I would now observe,

|
|

doubt but our society would, with pleasm,
accept the invitation; and I am_ persuade
it woulddo much good. Our freedom, as yo:
justly observe,depends entirely upon cu-
selves, and upon our availing ourselves uf th:
opportunity, which, once lost, may nut be
soon recovered.’”—And I observe upon tis,
because I think it tends to show, that, how
ever unprepared they might be to carry te
measures they had in view, into complete er
ecution, they had a strong impression upa

their minds, that, if they lost the opportunty, |

which to a certain degree they concerred
they then had, they should not be able vn
cover it again; and that therefore it waste
cessary, at all events, to take some steps.

This letter of the 5th of October, 17%,
having been written by Mr. Hardy, a lena
came trom Mr. Skirving to him, in an offical
way, Seating that those deputies might i
sent.—This letter is communicated, not ctl;
to the London Corresponding Society, bot t
the Society for Constitutional Informatica;
and in consequence of that communication.
both these societies sent delegates to ths
Scotch Convention—And, gentlemen, yu
will recollect, that, by the communicata
with Sheffield, Norwich, and other places,
they were likewise induced to send
1o the same convention.

These are the instructions given by te
London Corresponding Society, which wer
signed by the prisoner :—/* The articles of

rations!

Scotland, which had never thought of assum- | and lawful means.”— Rational ‘and lawful wre
ing the appellation or character of “ Conven- | words which are capable of almost any (0-

tion of the People ;”’—an appellation and cha-
racter which, for the purposes stated by my
learned friend, were totally unnecessary.

On the 5th of October, 1793, Mr. Hardy
writes a letter to Mr. Skirving, in which he
speaks of the trials of Muir and Palmer, who
had heen prosecuted for seditious conduct,
and then says, “The General Convention
which you mention, eppears to Mr. Mar-
garot, to whom alone I have communicated
your fetter,” (the letter to which this refers,
seems to have been dated the 2nd of Octo-
ber; but it has not been fuund) “ appears to
Mr. Margarot and myself to be a very ex-
cellent measure; and, as such, I could wish
you, without delay, to communicate it offi-
cially to our society, without any ways men-
tioning that you had written to me privately.”
—I mentioned this letter before.—I now state
it for the purpose of introducing the sending
delegates to the Scotch Convention.—« If, in

struction.—For, after it had been state 2
the report of their committee of constitsto:,
that the minority had a right to resist the
majority, for the pu of asserting, wist
they call, their indefeasible rights, soot
which they claim the right of equal, active
citizenship; rational and la: messs sft
any means which would be, according to bet
idea of reason, rational, and, according to thet
idea of law, lawful. They declare itto be
lawful for the minority to resist the majesty,
if the effect of the tyranny, as they callit, et
ercised by the majority, were to deprive
of their indefeasible civil rights; nemelf?
share in the government of their coutty,
both legislative and executive.

The other instructions are, “
He is directed to support the
representatives in parliamncst oug!
by their constituents.”

“ Thirdly—That the election

your official letter, you should require us to | ought to be restored to the people.”


i 7 Fourthly—That juries ought to be chosen
* lot.

a Me Fifthly—That active means ought to
it be used, to make every man acquainted
¢, with the rights and duties of eure wl

“ etathy=—thet the liberty of the press

must at all events be supported ; and that the
publication of political truths can never be
criminal.”

Now, gentlemen, you will observe that the
four last of these have no connexion whatever
with a parliamentary refurm.—The second
is only supporting the opinion, that represen-
tatives in parliament ought to be paid by
their constituents — an opinion formerly
adopted, and acted upon, in this country, but
long since abandoned, from a principle of po-
licy, which is obvious; and the adoption of
that opinion by the first constituent assembly
in France, led, perhaps, toall the mischicf
that followed.

When persons talk of rational and lawful
means, you must of necessity understand
them to use those words in the sense, and
according to the construction which they
themselves put upon the words. They say,
that their delegate should on no account de-
part from the principles of the socicty;
namely, the obtaining annual parliaments and
universal suffrage, ‘by rational and lawful

means—In the seventh instruction, they state
what they conceive to be lawful means;
namely, “ Thatit is the duty of the people to
Tesist any act of parliament repugnant to the
original prineiples of the constitution, as would
be every attempt to prohibit associations for
the purpose of reform.”— And _ therefore
bier considered, that any act of parliament,
and consequently any authority whatever,
however in the common estimation of man-
kind it might be deemed lawful, was to be
resisted by them, if it tended to prevent the
execution of their purpose; and that, there-
fore, any means taken towards such resis-
tance, were means taken for the purpose
of obtaining annual parliaments, and uni-
versal suffrage, by rational and lawful means.

It seems to me, therefore, that these articles
of instruction, upon the very face of them,
import a determination to resist the constitu-
ted power and authority of the country, ifa
resistance to this constituted power was neces-
sary to carry into execution their
obtaining annual parliaments, and universal
suffrage, by rational and lawful means ; and
that they considered resistance to the power
of the constituted authorities, as lawful means
to effect that purpose.—And, if they consi-
dered resistance as lawful means, it necessa-
tily also follows, that they considered attack
as lawful means.—For, if resistance is lawful,
an attack to supersede the necessity of resis-
tance, is also lawful.—Upon what principle is
attack in war lawful, but that resistance is
justifiable ? And attack is justifiable for the
purpose of a lia the necessity of that
resistance—Therefore these instructions do


Pope of


‘most explicitly declare their resolution to
maintain the object which they had in view,
by what they call rational and lawful means ;
which they have sufticiently shown jo be such
acts as are in direct opposition to the consti-
tuted authority of the country, and, conse-
quently, acts of rebellion.

Gentlemen, when this again is compared
with the report of their committee cf consti-
tution; and when I have shown that their
avowed principle is rebellion against every
government which is not constituted in the
manner in which they say a government
ought to be constituted, it is impossible to
give any other construction to these words,
“rational and lawful means,” than that
which I have given; namely, such means as,
by the exercise of their reason, unprejudiced,
they were taught to believe were lawful means ;
among which they included the right of the.
minority to resist even a vast majority of the
country, if that majority attempted to with-
hold from them those rights which they con-
sidered as indefeasible civil rights: namely, a
right to shure in the whole of the government of
their country, as well executive as legislative,

Gentlemen, the instructions which are
given to the delogates of the Society for Con-
j Stitutional Information, are couched, unques-
‘tionably, in much more cautious language.
| They contain no such resolution with respect
| to resistance, as is contained in the resolutions
, of the London Corresponding Society.—At the
' same time you will recollect, what my learned
) friend near me_now suggests to me, that all
| that was done in the Scotch Convention, in
: consequence of the instructions given to the
delegates of the London Corresponding So-
ciety, was afterwards fully approved by the
Society for Constitutional Information; and
that one of the acts so done, was in direct
conformity to those instructions (the seventh
instruction) “ That it is the duty of the peo-
ple to resist any act of parliament repugnant
to the original principles of the constitution,
as would be every attempt to prohibit asso-
ciations for the purpose of reform.”

Gentlemen, you will recollect that one of
the resolutions of this Scotch Convention
went directly upon the foundation of that ine
struction ; going, indeed, considerably beyond
it; and when I am told that persons who
send delegatcs, are to be considered as giv-
ing to those delegates no other authority than
what they specifically gave them, I admit
; that to a certain degree, that is true; but
, then, the moment they know that these dele-
gates go beyond their authority, they ought,
unquestionably, at least, to disavow them.—
But what has this Constitutional Society
done? Instead of disavowing any proceedings
| of the British Convention, it has declared its
approbation of them all; and the society has
considered itself as bound to give the most ef-
fectual support to the persons who came to
these resolutions.

Then what were the proceedings of this as-

4.1L


sembly when it met?—Gentlemen, I shall
not go through all their proceedings because
that would take up infinitely too large a por-
tion of your time ; but there are some few of
their proceedings upon which I shall venture
to comment :—In the first place I would notice
their declaring themselves “ the British Con-
vention of the People.”—For the purpose which
itis pretended they hadin view, that declaration
was absolutely unnecessary—not only abso-
Jutely unnecessary, but it was improper ; be-
cause if they were to convey to the parliament
ofthe country, what the opinions of men were
upon the subject, opinions conveyed by dele-
gation are, in all cases, totally improper ; but
opinions conveyed by delegation, where the
persons specifically delegating do not appear,
are still more improper.

Af ithad been described as a meeting of the
societies of Sheffield—of the societies of Lon-
don—of the societies of Norwich, and so on;
describing them in this way, there would have

een a possibility of ascertaining of whom
they were composed.—It woul also have
been just within possibility, and nothin;
more, that the delegates should convey the
sentiments of those persons whe composed
the several societies with respect to the sub-
ject of a reform in the House of Commons.—
But it would have been certainly, a very in-
complete method of conveying those senti-
ments.—For, you see, the delegate from the
Society for Constitutional Information would
have appeared to have conveyed the senti-
ments of Mr. Sheridan, and several other per-
sons, whose names are still upon the books,
as members of the Constitutional Society,
though they have not attended the society
for many years, and have really had nothing
to do with it for several years.—Therefore
these societies conld in fact, convey to parlia-
ment nothing more than the opinion of those
Particular men who took active parts in the
societies respectively ; and when their dete-
gates in Scotland assumed to themselves the
character of “ the convention of the people,”
and professed to convey the opinions of the
people, they must have practised an imposi-
tion upon the parliament; for they were only
a meeting of delegates, chosen by a few mem-
bers of these societies, and had no right to
represent themselves in the character of a
Convention of the People, for the purpose of
conveying to parliament the sentiments of the
people of this country, as desiring a parlia-
mentary reform. It was therefore not only
Panes but absolutely improper, that
they should assume the character of a Conven-
tion of the People.—For what purpose did they
assume that appellution @—It could only be
for the purpose of assuming the character of
@ convention of the people, and the power
which is necessarily attributable to a real con-
vention of the people? and, I conceive, that
is the only purpose for which you will be-
lieve they did assume jt.

The purpose suggested by the learned and


[igs

ingenious counsel, is one that cannot have
been within their view. It would have been
totally inconsistent, even with their ovn
principles, to have pretended to convey to the
parliament of this country, by means of the
opinions of a number of aslestes of the diffe.
rent societies; the opinions of the pes the
persons so delegated having clearly no right
whatever to state, that what they resolved
upon, was any thing more than the opinion of
a variety of clubs, or rather of some of the
several individual members who composd
those clubs.—But the evidence given of the
conversations with Mr. Yorke, puts this be-
yond all sort of doubt :---He said, “ The Br-
tish Convention split upon a rock—becmse
they declared themselves a venared fe the
people, before the people were prepared for it;
that thet maak fret to have come forward
with an address to the people at large;’"—
That is, that they ought to have continued ia
their original character ofa convention of de
legates of the different societies, till, bya
address to the people at large, they had pee
pared the minds of the people at large for the
declaration, that they were a convention
the people, in order to obtain that sort of
tacit consent to their declaration, which ms
obtained in France, to a declaration of the
same sort, by some of the members of the
states-general.—Those persons, on the

of June, 1789, being till then only membes
of the states-general of the kingdom, s
sembled under the authority of the king, ac-
cording to the ancient constitution of France,
and therefore, acting under that subordim-
tion to his authority which the ancient ao
stitution of France required, declared thea-
selves a National Assembly ; and, THEREFOR,
that the king could put no negative upon ther
authority.—If they had not been supported by
the people in that declaration, they could not
have acted in the character in which they thea
assumed to act; but the people did
them, and the public mind being pre|
support them as a convention ef the

and to give them all the force, the strength,
and efficiency of such a convention, from that
time, they did act as a convention of the pec-
ple, assembled by sufficient authority;
from that time, they were completely the >
vereign power of the state.

Mr. Yorke said, and truly, that the conver
tion at Edinburgh, had declared itself a cot
vention of the people, before the people were
Prepared to acknowledge them as such; that
they had thereby split upon a rock,
been able to carry their intentions intoexect
tion, and had therefore failed ; that they
to have addressed the public at large up?
the subject, and thus to have pre the
public mind; and if they found the
ready to support them in the charecter ¢ *
convention, which they meant to assume, _
to declare themselves such, and to assume
the power and superiorities, and all the &
thoritiesof a convention of the people.

Gentlemen this assembly of delegates of
clubs, having proceeded in this manner,
thought proper, not only to call itself a Con-
vention of the People—a British Convention of
the People, necessarily including the whole
island—but—Tue BRITISH CONVENTION, ONE
AND INDIVISIBLE—and to date their transac-
tions, the first year of the British Convention,
One and Indivisible.——What could this be
meant to express, but that they considered
themselves as the whole people of Great Bri-
tain, united, by delegation, in one common
cause, not to be separated—not to be divided,
until they had completely and effectually car-
tied into execution those purposes which the
several delegates carried with them into this
assembly ?—-What the purposes of Margarot
and Gerrald were, we have had clearly before
us upon evidence—-What was the purpose of
Mr. Yorke, who, though a delegate from the
Constitutional Society, did not actually go,—
we may infer, from all that he did and said
élsewhere,—— Now, that the whole is dis-
closed, and all its complex parts are put toge-
ther, it is clear that this very act was, initself
anact of High treason—And I beg to say,
that the Attorney-General, in his place in the
House of Commons, on the question relative
to the trials in Scotland, declared, that as far
as he could then view it, seeing it imperfectly
as he did, he was inclined strongly to think,
that it ought to have been soconstrued. But
an act may be an act of high treason, or an
actof sedition, merely, according to the de-
gree of evidence which may be produced
upon the subject. Unless you can show,
what was the object of the parties, you ma:
Not be able to prove it to be an act of hig
treason, although, in fact it was so.

What was the argument which Mr. Gibbs
pressed so much upon you? He did not deny,
that the acts of his client were extremely
blameable ; very seditious ; but thty do not,
said he, amount to high treason. And why
did he assert, that they did not amount to
high treason? ‘“ Because the evidence, taken
together, does not show that the prisoner had
conceived, within his mind, the guilty purpose
and intent of destroying the government of
the country, deposing the king, and establish-
ing a democratic government in its stead.”

In the prosecutions carried on in Scotland.
against the members of the British Conven-
tion, Margarot, Gerrald, Skirving, and the
rest, the full evidence was not possessed by
those who prosecuted ; they could not esta-
blish, by evidence, that degree of criminality
inthe minds of the parties, which is essen-
tially necessary for the purpose of constitut-
ing the crime of high treason ; and, therefore,
No blame is upon that account imputable, as I
contend, to the courts in Scotland, supposing
the act to be high treason.

The courts there are accused of having heen
over rigorous in their sentences.—It that
which has appeared in evidence here, had
appeared to them, I think, according to the


evidence which would then have been before
them, they must have considered the acts
as amounting to high treason; and it would
have been their duty to have taken care that
the persons, guilty of those acts, should hare
been prosecuted accordingly. But from the
evidence before them, the complete criminal
intent did not appear, and therefore they pro-
ceeded, according to the law of Scotland, for
the crime of sedition.

The question which was afterwards princi-
pally agitated, was, whether there existed, in
the law of Scotland, a distinct crime, denomi-
nated by the law of Scotland, “ Sedition,”*
which the law of England considers as a mere
misdemeanor, of different degrees of heinous-
ness, till it amounts to the crime of high
treason. Butif there did exist that distinc-
tion between treason and sedition, in the law
of Scotland (and sedition, in the ancient law
of England, seems to have been considered
as a distinct crime, in very remote times), and
if sedition in Scotland was capable of being
punished as such, a very severe punishment
must be the proper punishment for a crime
which arose to that height, that the only
question which could possibly be made upon
it was, whether it did, or did not, amount to
the heinous crime of high treason.

Gentlemen, the resolutions and proceedings
of this society in Scotland are very extraordi-
nary; they begin with declaring themselves
the British Convention, and their several pro-
ceedings have been read to you, in which itap-
pears that they corresponded with the prisoner ~
at the bar, and with several other persons. It
also appears that they adopted several of the
most seditious proceedings which have been
had in this country, and that they had reports
made to them of the state of the societies in
England, as well as in Scotland, the object of
which was to justify their declaring them-
selves a convention of the people.

It appears in the proceedings of the 6th of
November, 1793, that one of the Edinburgh
delegates having moved that the London de-
legates should state the situation of their so-
cieties, citizen Margarot answered, ‘that the

* I apprehend that this statement of the
question is not strictly correct. The doctrines
asserted by the counsel for the crown and
sanctioned by the high court of ssticianys
in the cases of Maurice Margarot and the other
members of the British Convention, respect-
ing the crime of sedition, have been much
canvassed and by many distinguished lawyers
impugned ; the true grounds on which the
propriety of the decision of the court of justi-
ciary has been questioned, will be found in
the ingenious and powerful arguments which
were delivered by the very learned and able
persons who disputed the relevancy of the in-
dictment in the case of Joseph Gerrald. Sce

this Collection, vol. 38, pp. 827. §69.

societies in London were very nuincrous,
though sometimes tluctuating—in some parts
of England whole towns are reformers; in
Sheflicld and environs there are fifty thou-
sand,"—thouch it has been shown to you
that the society there never consisted of more
than six hundred.
thirty socicties in one. If,” said Margarot,
“ we could get a convention of England and
Scotland called, we might represent six or
seven hundred thousand inales, which is a ma-
jority of all the adults in the kingdom, and
ministry would not dare to refuse us our
rights.” It was in consequence of this re-
presentation that they thought fit to give
themselves the title which [have stated to
you.

Gentlemen, you will recollect that in their
Proceedings they went to the extent of mak-
ing a new union between England and Scot-
land; an union which should perfectly re-

move all boundaries of distinction between '

‘the two kingdoms. Whether that would or

would not be a wise thing, may certainly ad- -

mit of a great deal of question; but there is a
contract existing between the two countries
upon the subject, and the persons assembled
at this meeting, take upon themselves, as far
as their authority goes, to break through that
contract, assuming a power of a most extra-
ordinary kind; not only sovereign power, but
Sovereigu pene tending to the destruction of
a solenin league between the two nations, at
One time separate, distinct, and independent
sovereign powers.

They resolved to publish an address to the ;

public, and a committee. was appointed to
consider the means, and to draw up the out-
lines of a plan of general union and co-opera-

tion between the two nations in their general |
pursuit of a thorough reform of parliament, |
They

which was unanimously agreed to.
likewise had a committee to draw up rules

for their internal government, and tickets for |
and they resolved, that this;

admission ;
should be a standing law of this, and all fu-
ture conventions, looking clearly in prospect,
toa regular and constant establishment, and
not to an accidental establishment, for a par-

ticular purpose. ‘Tisere are several other pro- |
ceedings which deserve your attention, but |

they are infinitely too numerous for me, now,
to observe upon ; such as proposing a general
fast, and a variety of other procecdings, which
clearly shew, that they considered themselves
as an assembly of a very different description
from that of delegates of the several societies,
met simply for the purpose of petitioning par-
liament fora reform in parliament. They re-
ceived contributions; patriotic gifts and dona-
tions; they adopted, in all their proceedings
those expressions which had been used in the
French Convention; they talked of their
own assembly, as the House; of taking the
sense of the House; and several other things
must have occurred to you, in the course of
their proceedings, if you looked at them, or

“In Norwich there are ,


| attended to them, when they were read, by
which you must be convinced, they had in
view an establishment, upon principles ver
different from those on which a meeting a
delegates of societies, for the purpose of ob-
| taining a reform in parliament, ought to have
been formed.
' You likewise recollect the pains they tok
to enlighten the Highlanders of Scotland. It
is impossible not to consider the terms they
used for this purpose as an incitemcat, di»
rectly, to the Highlanders to arm themselres.
You recollect the circumstance of a picture of
a Highlander, armed with his broad sed
and target ; and there are other circumstuce
of the same tendency, which are not now ix
mediately and distinctly inmy memory. _
There is also this resolution :—* That it
be recommended to the different societies
throughout the country, to copy the Bill of
Rights into their minute books, as the ground
of their proceedings, in order to prevent im-
' proper constructions upun their conduct, a
friends to reform.” This recommenistis
sccins to me to be precisely upon that princt
ple of deception which I have before nouced.
There could be no purpose whatever, for
which this resolution was to be inserted m
their minute books, but to deceive—to hold
out a peaceable and quiet reformation, whilst
they meant the reverse. If they really 3
proved of the Bill of Rights, had it not beea
universally derided in the books of whxb
they had testified the strongest approbation, —
in a work, in which it was called a bill of
wrongs, and treated with the utmost disregard
‘and contempt? But it served extremely wel
for the purpose; not only to cover the pro-
ceedings of the different societies, but to
mislead those societies, and to tell them,
that the Bill of Rights authorized the a
sembling a couvention of the people.
peuple in the different counties were told
that the Bill of Rights was the foundation
all their proceedings, and_ that therefore they
| should insert it in all their books; and when
| they were told, that it was lawful to assemble
| a convention of the people, they were led
| to believe, that the Bill of Rights madeit lw
ful for them to do so. These circumstances
tend to show the means by which the poot
cople, who were engaged with them, bare
Beets led and deceived, like that unfortusate
man who was examined, Hill. He told yoo
that he had nothing in view but the constr
tion of the House of Commons, as it was 2
the year 1688; there being, in effect, no al.
teration after that time, except the 7
act, and some other acts, which tended rather
to the benefit of the people, than to their 2
jury, in any way whatever. Lo.
Then comes their famous resolutions f
assembling a Convention of Emergency, &
which a blank was left in the minutes,
which they came to, on the 28th of Nose

ber,-1798.—I wish to know, how the le
counsel for the prisoner, whom I do not w¥


see in court—I wish he was here—I mean,
my learned friend who addressed you last,
with great force, with great energy, and cer-
tainly with a considerable degree of ability—
how he reconciles these resolutions, so left
in blank upon the minutes, with the principle
upon which he stated this convention to have
acted.—He did not, indeed, distinctly state
this convention to have acted upon it; he
rather suggested the principle, and then en-

deavoured to slur the matter over, to pass it |

Ly, asserting, that, whatever might ve im-
puted to this convention, it could not affect
that which was to have been assembled, and
the prisoner had nothing to do with it.
Gentlemen, you will recollect the solemnity
with which the transactions relative to these
resolutions were carried on; that, “ After an
excellent discussion of the question, pertinent
remarks and amendments, the convention
was resumed, and the whole, as amended,
heing read over, the members stood upon
their feet, and passed the resolutions, unani-
mously, as follows.”"—Y ou will recollect, like-

wise, that this was preceded, in the course of

the debate, by citizen Brown's siving a history

of the Habeas Corpus Act, and therefore ap- |

pearing to take an important part in the dis-
cussion of the question, Mr. Matthew Camp-
bell Brown, who was the delegate trom Shef-
field, and who has been stated as the Editor
of the Patriot—There is a blank in the mi-
nutes, for these resolutions; and then the
minutes import, that, “ After the said resolu-
tion, agreed to, and solemnly approved of, as
above, citizen Gerrald, in an energetic and ani-
mated specch, addressed the meeting, and ex-
pressed his happiness at the motion passed,
and exposed the act of the Irish parliament,
called a Convention Bill; and citizen Brown
followed him, in a manly speech, and proved
the influence of the executive government
over the parliament ;”—and_then-—Citizen
Margarut read and proposed a motion :---
“That a Secret Committee of three, with the
secretary, be appointed to determine the
Place where such Convention of Emergency
shall meet; that such place shall remain a
secret with them, and with the secretary of
this convention; and that each delegate shall,
at the breaking up of the present session, be
entrusted with a sealed letter, containing the
name of the place of mecting; that this
letter shall be delivered, unopencd, to his con-
stituents, the receipt of which shall be ac-
knowledged by a letter to the secretary---pre-
ferved in the same state, until the period shall
arrive, at which it shall be deemed necessary
jor the delegates to set off.”

Vhese resolutions, and a declaration accom-
Panying them, for which a blank was left in
the minutes, and which were not to be in-
serted till after the end of their proceedings,
Were in the fullowing words: “ Resolved, that
the following declarations and resolutions be
‘serted at the end of our minutes :” “ That
‘us convention, considering the calamitous


consequences of any act of the legislature,
which may tend to deprive the whole, or any
part of the people, of their undoubted right to
meet, either by themselves, or by delegation,
to discuss any matter relative to their common
interest, whether of a public or private nature,
and holding the same to be totally inconsis-
‘ent with the first principles and safety of
society, and also subversive of our known
and acknowledged Constitutional Liberties, do
hereby declare, before God and the World Si
—which, you recollect, is the solemn manner
in which an oath is taken, in Scotland, by
persons ofa particular description—“ that we
shall follow the wholesome example of former
times, by paying no regard to any act which
shall militate against the constitution of our
country, and shall continue to assemble and
consider of the best means by which we can
accomplish a real representation of the people,
and annual election, until compelled to desist
by superior force.”

Gentlemen, what is this but a declaration,
that they would resist force by force; that
they would resist, unquestionably, inferior

force; and that it should be superior force only

that should compel them to desist :—« And
we do resolve, that the first notice given for
the introduction of a Convention Bill or any
bill of a similar tendency to that passed in
Ireland, in the last session of their parliament,
or any bill for the suspension of the Habeas
Corpus Act.”—So that now they would have
been in actual rebellion, as the bill for the
suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act did pass ;
—“ or the act for preventing wrongous im-
prisonment, and against undue delays in trials,
in North Britain; or in case of an invasion,
or the admission of any Salen troops what-
soever, into Great Britain or Ireland; all, or
any of these calamitous circumstances, shall
be a signal to the several delegates to repair
to such place as the Secret Committee of this
convention shall appoint.” Throughout all
their proceedings you find a Secret Committee.
There is no one of the proceedings of any of
these societies which you have had before you,
in which you have not found a Secret Commit-
tec; that is,a few persons, who keep secret
from the rest all the important proceedings,
and guide and direct the whole. The forma-
tion of a Secret Committee being, necessarily,
the formation of a thing which they conceive
would not bear the open light of day, and par~
ticularly would not bear the eye of the exist-
ing government of the country, bound to keep
and support the peace of the country, ;—“ and
the first seven members shall have power to
declare the sittings permanent, and twenty-
one shall constitute a convention, and pro-
ceed to business.”

What is this but a declaration, that, if they
were compelled by superior force, to discon-
tinue their meetings at Edinburgh, where they
were then sitting, they would not, therefore,
cease to be aconvention of the people, but
that they would repair immediately to such

place as the Secret Committee should appoint;
that the first seven members, who should
meet at such place, should have power to
declare the sitting permanent, should con-
stitute a convention immediately, and the
moment they amuunted to twenty-one, they
should proceed to business? If they had been
compelled by superior force, by the authority
and power of the government of the country,
to desist from their meeting at Edinburgh
and had assembled themselves again, in an-
other part of the country, what could that
assembly meet for, but for the purpose of
evading the effect of that superior force,
which miglit have dispersed them at Edin-
burgh, and of acting in that place, at which
they should afterwards assemble with more
effect, because supported with that degree of
force which they might conceive sufficient to
protect them against the existing constituted
government of the country.

They likewise resolved,—“ That each dele-
gate, immediately on his return home, do con-
vene his constituents, and explain to them
the necessity of electing a delegate or dele-
gates ;"—-which I conceive must necessarily
mean something like the constitution of the
French National Assembly, who have persons
to fill immediately, without any delay, the
seats which become vacant ;—“ and of esta-
blishing a fund, without delay, against any of
these emergencies, for his or their expense,
and that they do instruct the said delegate or
delegates, to hold themselves ready to depart
at one hour’s warning.”—Then they resolved,
which shows clearly what they meant by the
other part of the resolution, “ That the mo-
ment of any illegal dispersion of the present
convention, shall be considered as asummons
to the delegates to repair to the place of
meeting, appointed for the Convention of
Emergency, by the Secret Committee, and that
the Secret Committee be instructed to proceed,
without delay, to fix the place of meeting.”
So that, without delay, this Secret Committee
were immediately to proceed to fix upon some
place, at which this assembly of people were
to meet, if they should be dispersed by the
superior power of government; and at which
place, therefore, they were necessarily to meet,
in opposition to the existing government of
the country.

Now, gentlemen, this was communicated
most completely to Mr. Hardy, by a letter,
written to him by Mr. Margarot, on the 11th
of December, 1793; and Margarot expressly
states, that the convention had declured itself
permanent ; by which he must have meant,
that the effect of this declaration was, as it
obviously was, to make the convention a per-
Tanent assembly, the declaration of perma-
nency being one of the most important parts
of the proceedings of the French National
Convention, at the same time it declared it-
self a National Convention. The means which
it took for the purpose, being that of destroy-
ing, at least in the opinion of the people, all

authoritative collection of revenue, whenever
the assembly should be dispersed, and autho-
rizing the collection, so long only as the a
sembly should continue sitting. And gentle.
men, you will recollect, in the history of you
own country, the same sort of permanency,
under the authority of an act o' parliamea,
was the means by which the parliament, 0
the reign of Charles ist, finally destroyed the
authority of that monarch.

This letter of Margarot to Hardy has like
wise a direct reference to the appointrent a
the sitting of this convention, by the Secret
Committee, in some other place, in case thes
should be dispersed. It states, that the qo-
vention had declared itself permanent; by
which it must have adverted to this resolutza,
which you will see is, in effect, a declaratsa
of permanency; and it likewise says, te
are to sit in some other part of the country,
not yet declared, in case of their i
which must refer (I am quoting only fon
memory, for I have not the letter in my
hand) ‘to that part of the resolutions, by
which it was made of the instructions b
the Secret Committee, without delay, to irs
place at which the convention should mee,
in case of its dispersion, or under other circum
stances, in which they thought it proper tha
the Convention of Emergency should meet.

Gentlemen, I beg pardon for stating thi
letter. Iam told, that, by some accident,
has not been given in evidence, therefore you
will lay that quite out of your consideraton
You will recollect, however, that, in pursuance
of these resolutions, the convention actualy
did refuse to disperse, until compelled by 2
superior force; and this is proved by 2 letter
of Margarot, in which he states, that Gemald
and himself were pulled out of the chai;
and upon the cross-examination of Ross by
Mr. Erskine, the same fact was stated; 9
that they not only came to the resolution, bat
they really acted upon it, to a certain degree.
But the other parts ‘of these resolutions
when considered with reference to the whol,
have very extraordinary consequences;
you will observe that this convention was
meet as a Convention of Emergency, at2*
cret place, to be appointed by a Secret
mittee, not only in case of its being compe!
to desist from its proceedings, sitting at
burgh, by superior force, but also in sm
other cases; particularly, as soon as ay 0+
tice should be given for the introduction of
convention bill. As soon as any meaxlt
should appear to be taken by the governmest
of the country for the purpose o on
their meeting, which they should
might be likely to have effect, they were ”
assemble in that secret place to be appot!
by the committee of emergency, remo™s
themselves from Edinburgh, in which a
they might not think they should be 9
to resist the powers of ae non as Le
more distant place. ‘This they extend #0 a
the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act

to the admission of foreign troops ; a report
having been very industriously circulated of
an intention to bring overa great number of
foreign troops into this country.

But they declare also, that this convention
shall meet as a Convention of Emergency in
another event; that is, in case of invasion.
Iam sure I recollect the letter having been
read which informed Hardy of the secret re-
solutions, because I recollect that the words
“in case of an invasion” are omitted in that
letter. But Margarot states in that Ictter
that the convention has done that which he
does not think it safe to communicate by let-
ter:—“ The convention proceed with great
spirit ; we sit daily; and last week we came
to aresolution which we fancy will give plea-
sure to every friend to reform. As the mi-
nutes are to be printed, we will at present
only give you the heads of it; viz—That
should any attempt be made by government
for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus bill,
the introduction of a convention bill, or the
landing of foreign troops in Great Britain or
Ireland, the delegates are immediately to as-
semble in convention at a certain place (the
appointment of which is left with a secret
committee) ; that when seven delegates shall
be thus assembled they shall declare them-
selves permanent, and when their number

amounts to twenty-one they shall proceed to
business. Thus, you sec, we are providing
against what may happen.” This is a letter
written to Mr. Hardy himself.“ Thus you
see, we are providing against what may hap-
pen.” Then the letter proceeds to state—
“ Letters convey but very imperfectly, and
with no great degree of safety, what we might
wish to inform each other of.” And ina sub-
sequent Ictter of the 8th of Deccmber, 1793,
you will find he says—* Not daring any
onger to trust tu the post, we send you all
_ these papers in a parcel ;” what papers these
were does not appear. “ You will be so good
as to make us acquainted with their sate ar-
rival. Gerrald wishes to get to London as
_ S00n as possible; he will communicate that
" which cannot so fully be expressed by letter.
You may consider this as a private letter ;
but you may read such parts of it as you think
Proper to any member of the society, especi-
ally where it may be productive of good.”
Then here are resolutions come to which
they are afraid to enter on the minutes of
their proceedings ; which they are afraid to
communicate entire in their correspondence
between each other; which they Icave, there-
fore, to be communicated by word of mouth
by one of the parties present: and even the
very letter, thus cautiously written, is written
to Mr. Hardy as a@ private letter, of which he
might communicate such parts as he might
think proper to any member of the society,
leaving to him the selection of the matter,
and the parts he might so communicate;
| perhaps, according to the degree of fervor in
' the public cause he might conceive a particu-


lar member to have, and the particular confi~
dence he might have in the discretion of that
member; and this is to be especially where
it may be productive of good ; showing most
clearly by this that the prisoner was the active
means by which the whole of this conspiracy
was to be carricd on; the person with whom
Margarot (who was then acting as agent of
the society at Edinburgh) was to correspond,
in whose discretion he was wholly to confide,
and who was to communicate to the other
members such partsonly of this correspond-
ence—mutilated as it is, from the fear of dan-
ger that may attend acommunication hy letter
—to communicate such parts of it only as he
thought proper.

Gentlemen, I stated that it was my inten-
tion to advert to that part of the minutes
which followed the blank where these resolu-
tions ought to have been entered, if they had
been entered according to the daily and the
ordinary course of their proceedings. After
stating the solemn manner in which these re-
solutions were passed—the very solemnity
with which they were passed showing the
importance which those persons attached to
them, and the omission of the word invasion
in the communication still more strongly
showing the importance which they attached
to that particular word—* Citizen Margarot
read and proposed the following motion—
“that a secret committee of three with the
secretary be appointed to determine the place
where such convention of emergency shalk
meet ; that such place shall remuin a secret
with them and with the secretary of this con-
vention ; and that each delegate shall, at the
breaking up of the present session, be en-
trusted witb a sealed letter containing the
name of the place of meeting—that this letter
shall be delivered unopened to his constitu-
ents, the receipt of which shall be acknow-
ledged by a letter to the secretary—preserved
in the same state until the period shall arrive
at which it shall be deemed necessary for the
delegates to set off.” So that the place of
meeting of this convention was not only to be
determined upon by a secret committee of
three (a very small number), but they also
resolved that it should remain secret with
them and the secretary; and that at the
breaking up of the then present session (if
during the session it should be necessary to
make use of this cominittee of emergency at
a secret place) each member should carry
with him, ina sealed letter, the name of the
place of meeting; that this should be delivered
unopened to his constituents; that the re-
ceipt should be acknowledged by a letter to
the secretary; and that the scaled letter
should remain in the same state till the period
should arrive at which it should be deemed
necessary for the delegates to set off. So it
was not to be known to any one member of
the society, except the secret committee and
their secretary, where that place was to be.

Now, gentlemen, bave such proceedings as

these the least semblance of a design to peti-
tion parliament only for the purpose of parlia-
mentary reform? It is utterly absurd to give
any credit to stich a suggestion. And, gen-
tlemen, you will likewise recollect that my
learned friend, Mr. Gibbs, admitted, that if
you could not give his construction to their
proceedings, you must necessarily give the
construction which we put upon them —that
if you could not take the colour he gave
you; if you could not persuade yourselves
that the only object of this meeting was quictly
and peaceably to prepare petitions to the
parliament, praying that that reform in
the election of representatives might be carried
into execution which they pretended they had
proposed upon the wild plan, as I venture to
call it, of the duke of Richmond, or any other
specific plan they might think proper to
adopt ; if the object of their mecting was any
thing beyond that, it was impossible for him
to justify it, though he should not admit it to
receive all the attributes which we have
givenit.

The minutes of this day’s sitting refer toa
proceeding which, I think, distinctly had in
view that which afterwards appears in other
parts of the proceedings—the supporting a
convention by force. It is idle to say that a
convention of this kind could have any effect
whatever unless supported by force; and
therefore it is not necessary to show you that
any proceedings had taken place for the pur-
pose; for when it is of necessity that in order
to carry the thing into execution it should be
supported by force, it is not necessary to show
you that proceedings had been had for the
purpose of creating that force. If persons
orm a plan (such as was fabricated for the
bishop of Rochester, and several persons of
high rank) to bring in the Pretender—If that
had been a real paper signed with the names
of those persons who it was supposed had
signed it (it turned out to be a wicked con-
trivance of two villanous men); but if it had
been a real paper, it would have been an act
of high treason, though they had procured:no
force. But the moment they put their hands
to that paper, which demonstrated their inten-
tion to conspire to overturn the government
of the country ; demonstrating that intention
by an overt act, namely, the puting their
hands to that paper; the crime of high treason
was complete, though they could not possibly
have carried it into eftect but by raising an
armed force, and notwithstanding they had
taken no steps to raising that armed force.
But here you have several traits of the ten-
dency of this society to raise an armed force,
even in the proceedings of this convention.
They resolved —“ that a fund should be raised
by subscription for defraying the expense of
small patriotic publications to be distributed
in the Highlands; that every publication
should bear the figure of a Michldad-cyn in
full dress, with target and broad sword to
attract the attention of Highland-men: no


publication to cost more than half a penns”
For what purpose could such publicat..
possibly be distributed, but to excite m.
people m the Highlands to arm _themselye'
—What has the figure of a Highlander in iu
dress, with target and broad sword, to do wi:
a quiet, peaceable petition to reform pani
ment? It has no connexion with it in te
world. It has a clear connexion with acx
vention which was intended to be suppene.
by force of arms; but has no possible couze-
ion whatever with that which my lease
friend says was the object of this conveutx.
namely, simply and only petitioning pow
ment.

They propose, also, to appoint a commie
of observation in London, for the purpox<
observing what was done there. What pox.
upon that occasion? Margarot says—“ th:
there was no occasion for a committee of tt:
nature in London, as there were several the
sand people in that city upon the look.
It was accordingly agreed, that the comm
tee should request the London commitet
correspondence to give the earliest intei-
gence of what passed in parliament.”

Gentlemen, you will recollect that wu
committee so referred to, was the Secret (ca
mittee of the London Corresponding Socie's:
which Secret Committee was by this 1e%
lution converted into a committee of obser
tion for the British Convention, for the pz
pose of giving information of every tit
which should pass in parliament, sod ©
London, upon this subject. That clea
shows the connexion and dependence of ta
very convention upon the London Core
ponding Society, in the hands of its leades:
videlicct, the Secret Committee, and those ¥
directed that Secret Committee = which shes
that the whole was really, and in effect,
operation of those societies in London; a
that the proceedings at Edinburgh were
proceedings of persons who were only al:
as the puppets of those in London.

Highlanders were to be enlighteas’—ty

You will likewise recollect, that throught
the proceedings of this convention they #1"

tions, and soon, every thing that was oet
sary to be established for the purpox *
convention actually meeting as a convents”
of the people, upon the principles upon “
we have proved they intended to act
they were preparing to publish the nalun
unalienable, and imprescriptible rights of
and that a committee was appointed for that
purpuse. To show that application to /¥ ant
ment was not within the considerativa of #"
of those who were at least the leading m
bers in this business, or indeed the 930°

of the members of the convention, a nouol
for drawing out a scroil of a petition 0 parler
ment was read on the of Novembes


1798, the tenth day’s sitting, and the order of
the day was moved upon it. Now this isa
meeting which my learned friends would
attempt to persuade you was solely for the
purpose of petitioning parliament, and one of
the first things they do is, to move the order
of the day upon a motion for petitioning par-
Tiament.

You recollect, eiilenets the manner in
which they treated distinctions of rank in the
case of lurd Daer—in the use of the word
gentleman—the insipidity of the term gentle-
man, and the propriety of the term citizen—
and a thousand other circumstances, which
abow throughout the principles which the
members of this convention meant to adopt,

to carry into effect as far as they could
You will recollect what Mr. Skirving said in
the course of the proceedings. Upon a
motion that was made he insisted “ that it
was prpce on all occasions to take the opinion
of the primary societies, and he considered
the convention as only a committee of the
people.” So that Mr. Skirving, in the very
Proceedings of this conventiun, was acting
upon the grand principles of all those rights
of man—that every form of government to be
established among them was to be considered
only as a committee of the people, and that the
sense of the people was to be taken upon all
acea-ions. Principles which the French
Rational assemblies have constantly found it
impossible to carry into execution; and you
Toust particularly recollect that they refused

~ to carry them into execution upon the most

important subject which could come before
them, namely, the death of their king. For
when some of the leading members—some of
the must enlightened—probably with a view
of saving the king, wished to refer the consi-
deration of tha' question to the primary
assemblies in different parts of the country, it
was negatived, on the ground of the impussi-

» Ddility of carrving it into real and effectual
* @xectition ; and because, if it could have been

earried effectually into. execution, it must
have tended w destroy the Convention it-
self.

Gentlemen, you will recollect likewise, in
the course of the debate which took place upon

: what they termed the unprecedented infringe-

ment of the liberty of the press, and the arbi-
trary sentence of judge Wilson against Mr.

; Holt——Mr. Justice Wilson being a man
. whom all those who are of the same profes-

sion must revember with deep regret and
concern, and must acknowledge that he was
one of the worthiestand the most upright men
that ever graced the bench——Gentlemen,
in taking notice of these things, which they
consider as abuses, Mr. Margarot observes—
“It is unnecessary to attempt to lop off the
branches while we are endeavouring to: ”
and there is a blank,—-Endeavouring to what?
How can you fill up that blank ?—* It is un-
Necessary to éttempt to lop off the branches
while we are. endeavouring to cut down the


tree.” You cannot fill up the blank in any
other way.

Gentlemen, I might go through the whole
of the minutes of the proceedinys of this con-
vention ; there are several other passages
which equally meritattention; and it is evident
that throughout the whole of their proceed-
ings they contemplated the idea of acting by
force of their own authority, supported by the
force of so many of the people at large as they
could prevail upon to sustain their measures ;
that they looked to the attainment of their
objects by those means; and probably also by
the assistance of that foreign power which the
two societies in London, the Constitutional
Society, and the London Corresponding So-
ciety, had, in the latter end of the year 1792,
clearly invoked—by means, probably, of the
assistance of that power, for you cannot give
any other interpretation to the words,“ In the
case of an invasion.” They clearly looked to
the atainment of their ends cither by their
own force alone, or by that force assisted by
such foreign force.

This convention being dispersed by the su-
perior force of the constituted government,
after that resistance which the members of
the convention thought proper to give, and.
which necessarily was only a formal resiat-
ance, because they had not prepared measures
for any more effectual resistance—what .was
done ?—A meeting upon this was held, and a.
variety of proccedings took place, in London,
all tending to assemble another convention,
expressly declaring, that in consequence of the
dispersion of the British Conventivn,. they
were determined to assemble another. For
the proceedings had not arrived at that ripe-
ness which could enable them to carry intoex-
ecution, the plan of that convention of emer-
gency, which they had suggested in the mi-
nutes of the convention in Scotland, because
that could not have been completely carried
into effect with respect to England, unless
they had had a greater proportion of delegates
from England, than they actually had. Finding
that impracticable, they turned their minds to
the assembling another British Conventionin
England, and they openly avowed their inten-
tion of assembling that convention in England.

Gentlemen, the first proceedings which
seem to have been directly taken for that
purpose were the resolutions of the Constitu-
tional Society, on the 17th of January 1794;
but previous to that time a letter was written
by the prisoner, on the 10th of January, to
Mr. Adams, the Secretary of the Constitu-
tional Society, merely informing him of the
anniversary dinner ef the London Corres-
ponding Society, intended on the 20th of Ja-
nuary, 1794. I meation that circumstance,
because it drew both the Societies together in
the transactions of that day. There was no
reason for giving the Constitutional Society
any notice of that anniversary dinner, unless
for the purpose of enabling them to attend it
if they thought proper.

4M

~ Gentlemen, I should have reminded you,
that in the mean time Mr. Margarot had com-
municated to Mr. Hardy the circumstances
which had passed at the dispersion of the
British Convention, and had excited him by
all means to take some spirited resolves upon
the subject—Mr. Hardy in his answer to Mar-
garot, continued to represent that the society
would act as Margarot desired them to do;
and he writes to the secretary of the society
at Norwich, this letter, on the 11th of Ja-
nuary, 1794.—Fellow Citizen. I have just re-
ceived a letter from citizen Margarot, at Edin-
burgh, with some of the Edinburgh Gazet-
teers,” (you observe this is a day after the
letter he wrote to Adams, informing him of
the anniversary dinner, of the 20th of Ja-
nuary) “where you will see that citizen
Skirving is found guilty, and sentenced for
fourteen years transportation to Botany Bay.
Margarot’s trial comes on next. He meets it
with great firmness and resolution. I have
No time to make comments on the proceed-
ings; but I think our opponents are cutting
their own throats as fast as they can. Now
is the time for us to do something worthy of
men.” Why was it the time for them to do
something worthy of men ?—“ The brave de-
fenders of liberty, South of the English Chan-
nel, are performing wonders: driving their
enemies before them, like chaff before the
whirlwind.”

What was in the mind of Mr. Hardy when
he wrote that letter? What could be in his
mind, but that persuasion which we see gene-
rally diffused throughout all their proceedings,
that the success of the French republic, was
intimately connected with the success of
their own schemes; that they were all em-
barked in one common cause—that their
hope and reliance was not upon a majority of
the people of this country—for I think even
the report of the committce of constitution
shows, that they had no hope of obtaining
that majority, but that they did hope they
should obtain so large a party, that, with the
success of the French republic, they should be
able finally to accomplish their object—at
least they thought that that was the time to
strike. ‘ Now is the time for us tu do some-
thing worthy of men—the brave defenders of
liberty South of the English Channel, are per-
forming wonders; driving their enemies before
them, like chaff before the whirlwind.” The
letter proceeds, “ The London Corresponding
Society is to have a general meeting, and an
anniversa.y dinner, on Monday the 20th in-
stant, at the Glohe-lavern, Strand.” Advert-
ing, you see, in this very letter to that in-
tended meeting, on the 20th of January; a
meeting upon which my learned friends have
not dared to say one single word—advert-
ing to that meeting, as the time when it might
reasonably be supposed, that something would
be donc in consequence of what was mention-
ed in the former part of this letter.

There is one passage in this letter, trifling


i

(1268

as it may appear, which I cannot avoid ob-
serving upon; because it is a pi > which,
give me leave to say, a little contradicts that
character which has been given of the pr-
soner, “I have sent you some of Marzarot'’s
and Skirving’s indictment, with two copies of
a pamphlet on an am the author is a mem-
ber of our society—I y
may putitin practice. It will be a great saving
to many families—also a diminution of the re-
venue—for every one brewing their own beer,
pay no duty for it.” So that, you see, the
prisoner had in his contemplation, a dimim-
tion of the revenue of the country, as an ob-
ject which he thought proper to recommend te
the person to whum he wrote at Norwich;
uot simply for the purpose of saving money
to families, but as it would affect the revenue
of the country, and therefore, as he conceived
affect those persons whom he considered »
his enemies, the constituted government of
the country. It is a trifling circumstance,
but trifling circumstances like these, which
are the natural overflowing of a man’s mind,
show the temper of that mind more than what
he writes when he is under some degree of re-
straint.

Gentlemen, I shall next notice to you,
some resolutions of the Society for Consute-
tional Information, on the 17th of January,
1794, upon which, as I recollect, no observa-
tion has been made by either of the learned
counsel, and which no member of the Const-
tutional Society has been called to explain.

“ Resolved, that law ceases to be an ob-
ject of obedience, whenever it becomes an in-
strument of oppression.”

“Resolved, that we recall to mind with
the deepest satisfaction, the merited fate of
the infamous Jefferies, once lord chief justice
of England, who at the era of the glorious re-
volution, for the many iniquitous sentences
which he had passed, was torn to pieces, by a
brave and injured pcople.”

“ Resolved, that those who imitate his
example, deserve his fate.”

Gentlemen, when these resolutions are
considered with reference to that which fol-
lows, what is the meaning of them, bat an
incitement to the people of Scotland (for you
see it has reference to those cases in Scotland)
to follow the example of the persons who are
represented as having torm to pieces the inf-
mous Jefferies ?

“ Resolved, that the Tweed, though it may
divide countries, ought not, and does not,
make a separation between those principles of
common sccurity, in which Englishmen, and
Scutchmen, are equally interested ; that in
justice in Scotland, is injustice in England;
and that the safety of Englishmen is endan
gered whenever their brethren of Scotland,
or a conduct which entitles them to the ap-
probation of all wise,and the support of all
brave men, are sentenced to Botany Bay; 3
punishment hitherto inflicted only on felons,”

Here they resolve, that the conduct of those

f you approve of it, you |

a em eo eT
| ealgted in Scotland, was not only not blamea-
Je, but a conduct which entitled them to the
approbation of all wise and the support of all
brave men. The epithet, brave, is pretty
striking. A peaccable and constitutional sup-
of a man, does not require much bravery;
ut a support by force, may require bravery—
-when therefore the approbation of all wise,
and the support of all brave men, is called for,
one may easily guess what it is that the per- ,
sons who enter into those resolutions mean. |
They add,

“ Resolved, that we see with regret, but
see without fear, that the period is fast ap-
proaching, when the liberties of Britons must |
depend, not upon reason, to which they have
long appealed, nor on their powers of express-
ing it, but on their firm, and undaunted reso-
lution to oppuse tyranny, by the same means |
by which it is exercised.” What is that but
an explicit declaration, that the time was fast
approaching, when they conceived, that it!
would be necessary to exert force? Whether |
according to their ideas, force had hecome |
Mecessary or not, you cannot determine. It
never can be an object of determination for a
jury, or for any court of justice, whether the
subjects of a government, are entitled tu rise
in rebellion against that government, in con-

nence of any conduct of that government.
It 1s a question, which whenever it does arise, |
can be decided only by the sword. It never
can come into discussion in a court of justice.
Therefore, if the conduct of the government
of the country has been ever so oppressive, a
court of justice cannot permit itself to dis-
cuss, whether that occasion has arisen, which
amounts to the dissulution of all government,
and when therefore it can itself have no au-
thority to act—This resolution follows.

“ Resolved, that we approve of the conduct
of the British Convention, who though assail-
led by force, have not been answered by argu-
ment, and who, unlike the members of a cer-
tain assembly, have no interest distinct from
the common body of the people.” A_ resolu-
tion, which not only adopts all the proceed-
ings of that convention, and all their conduct
but particularly and distinctly adopts that
part of their conduct, in which they declared
themselves a Convention of the People, and de-
clared that they meant by that declaration,
that they were representatives of the common
body of the people.

The last resolution is, “‘ That a copy of the
above resolutions be transmitted to citizen
William Skirving, secrétary to the British
Convention, who is now imprisoned, under
colour of law, in the Tolbvoth of Edinburgh.”

Gentlemen, this led to the proceedings of
the 20th of January, 1794, at the Globe tavern,
and these proceedings are extremely strong—
a recollect that these proceedings appear to

we been wholly a concerted business; that
they were nothing like the acts of the persons
who met there, but that they were proceed-

ings previously determined upon, Mr. Thel-


wall, seems to have had ‘a principal hand in
Preparing the account of the proceedings,
which was printed and distributed; and he
detivered it to Davidson the printer, to be
printed on the 18th of January—Gentlemen,
this account of the proceedings, begins thus,
“ Ata general mecting of the London Corres-
ponding Society heldatthe Globe tavern, in the
Strand, on Monday, the 20th day of January,
1794,citizen John Martin in the chair—The fol-
lowing address to the people of Great Britain,

‘and Ireland, was read and agreed to.” So

that you see, gentlemen, they are detcr-
mined to prucced with a sort of caution, which
had not been observed in the proceedings of
the Convention at Edinburgh, in preparing
the minds of the people by a previous address
for the meeting of an assembly, which should
assume the character of a convention of the
people. This you will recollect was an idea
which clearly had occurred to some persons
who were concerned in the conspiracy, par-
ticularly to Mr. Yorke; and which he com-
municated in conversations which have been
stated to you in evidence.

This address, speaking of the abuses which
are supposed to exist in the British govern-
ment, and speaking of the laws of the country
says—“ We ure every day told, by those per-
sons who are interested in aupperting the
corruption list, and an innumerable host of
sinecure placemen, that the constitution of
England is the perfection of human wisdom ;
that our laws (we should rather say, their laws)
are the pertection of justice ;”—and then they
proceed to speak of the administration of the
country—They then state a number of pro-
ceedings which they think proper to find fault
with—The convention bill in feland—the
proceedings in Scotland—and they add—* In
Scotland, the wicked hand of power has been
impudently exerted, without even the wretch-
ed formality of an act of parliament,”—hav-
ing before adverted to the act of parliament
which had been passed in Ireland “ magis-
trates have forcibly intruded into the peaceful
and lawful meetings of freemen, and, by force
(not only without Taw, but against law) have,
under colour of magisterial office interrupted
their deliberations, and prevented their asso-
ciation;”—A declaration that they conceived
the dispersion of that Convention at Edin-
burgh was an illegal act—Then they add—
«The wisdom and good conduct of the Bri-
tish Convention at Edinburgh, has been such
as to defy their bitterest enemies to name the
law which they have broken; notwithstand-
ing which, their papers have been seized, and
made use of as evidence against them; and
many virtuous .and meritorious individuals
have been, as cruelly as unjustly, tor theit
virtuous actions, disgraced and destroyed, by
infamous and illegal sentences of transporta-
tion ; and these unjust and wicked judgments
have been executed with a rancour and ma-
lignity never before known in this land. Our
respectable and beloved fellow citizens have

been cast fettered into dungeons, amongst
felons, in the hulks to which they were not
sentenced.”

Gentlemen, what are those virtwous acts of
this British Convention?—When we read
their proceedings, is not the whole of their
conduct a tissue of conspiracy—of sedition—
of treason and rebellion against the govern-
ment of the country ?——And yet these ave
the actions which the London Corresponding
Society think proper to call virtuous actions—
which the Society for Constitutional Informa-
tion describes as that which entitled them to
the approbation of all wise, and the support of
all brave men.—Persons who so declare them-
selves with respect to the proceedings of such
an assembly as the British Convention as-
sembicd at Edinburgh, declare themselves
adverse to all government; not only to the
existing government, but, it seems to me, to

] government. If individuals may s0 act
with impunity, it is impossible for any govern-
ment to exist.

. They then proceed—* Citizens, we all ap-
prove the sentiments, and are daily repeat-
ing the words, for which our respectable and
valuable brethren are thus unjustly suffering.
—-We, too, associate, in order to obtain a
fair, free, and full representation of the
ple.”—Where? In the House of Commons?
—No—* in a house of real national repre-
sentatives :""—Here is an express declaration,
that they do not mean a reform in the House
of Commons: it isa declaration, that they
associate in order to obtain a fuir, free, and
Sull representation of the people in a house of
real nutional representatives.—Why do they
declare this now ?—Why ! because they find
that now was the time or never, as Mr. Hardy
expressed it in his letter, for them to do some-
thing worthy of men, when the French were
driving their enemies before them, like chaff be-
fore the whirlwind.—They proceed—* Are we
also willing to be treated as felons, for claim-
ing this, our inherent right, which we are
determined never to forego, but with our
lives, and which none but thieves and traitors
ean wish to withhold from us?”—Gentle-
men, these inherent rights they declare, in
their committce of constitution, to be, the
right of every citizen, not only to a share in
the egislatice, but in the executive government
of the country. That right could only be ex-
ercised by the creation of a representative go-
wernment; and here they declare, they “ as-
*ociate in order to obtain a fair, free, and full
Tepresentation of the people, in a house of
real national representatives ; and ‘ that th

‘ considered that as their inherent right, which
$ they were determined never to forego, but
‘ with their lives. ”

Gentlemen, this is the clearest and the
most decisive declaration of the intentions of:
these men, when combined with all that is be-
fore stated, and may explain any thing which
is ambiguous in it, if amy thing is ambiguous.
Atreally.appears to me, that there is nothing


(eve

ambiguous in this paper, What is it butde
claring, that they hed associated—that is, that
they had conspired—in order to obtain « far
free and full representation of the people, ms
house of real national representatives, and ia
auch a house only; and that they claimed ts
as an inherent right, which they were de-
termined never to forego, bat with the hamwd
of their lives. When they say, they are de
termined zever to forego that nght, but with
their lives, it amounts to the same thiag a5
eaying, that they were determined to ascert 2,
at the hazard of their lives—Gentemen,
what construction can be pat upon ths
paper, but that it is the most direct incite
ment that can Pesby be conceived, all
the members of their society, t0 ase sorce—
and indeed to all the persons to whom this
letter was addressed—the people of Grest
Britain and Ireland?

They proceed—“Can you beliewe, that
those who sent virtuous Inshmen and Scotch-
men, fettered with felons, to Botany Bay, de
not meditate, and will not attempt, to seue
the first moment to send us after them; er,
if we had not just cause to apprehend de
same inhuman treatment—if, instead of the
most imminent danger, we were in perfet
safety from it, should we not disdain to es}
any liberty or privilege whatever, in wha
our honest Irish and Scoteb brethren did mg

ally and as fully participate with wa
Their cause, then, and our’s, is the same;
and it is both our dety and our interest
stand or fall together. The Irish parkammest,
and the Scotch jndges, actuated by the same
English influence, have brought us derectty @
the point. There is no farther step beyond that
which they have taken. We are at issue”
—What ts the meaning of these words, = Wr
4BE aT Issue?” We are come to the point
in which we must repel force by fosce—
There can be no other meaning given to these
words—“ We must now chuvse at enee,
either liberty or slavery, for ourselves and ew
posterity.—Will you wait til barracks me
erected in every village, and till subsidined
Hessians and Hanoverians are upon us?”—
In the very moment that they slander the
government of the country by those expres
sions, they clearly declare their meaning>—
They assert that the government of the coen-
try has in contemplatien to oppress them by
force, and that the government of the coun
try having formed that intention to oppress
them by force, they are determined also te
use force—“ There 1s no farther step beyond
that which they have taken—VW are at 1s8un
—We must now choose at once, either hiberty
or slavery, for ourselves and our posterity."—
And they declare that they would not wait
till the government should take more efiec-
tual steps for the of restraining them.

They add, “ You may ask, perhaps, dy
what pea shall we ron nee sae ne

wi rve, men, same
Io re-echoed bac, fm different words, ima ve

viety of publications, originating all from that
Siess ofthe 6th of Aigutt, 1792, and which
shows, that the leading men in these pro-
ceedings had the same thing in view, at least
from that period.—“ You may ask, perhaps,
by what means shall we seck redress ¥—We an-
swer, that men in a state of civilized society,
ere bound to seek redress of their grievances
from the laws, as long as any redress can be
obtained by the laws; but our common mas-
aes, whom we serve (whose law is a law of
liberty, and whose service is perfect freedom)
has taught us not to expect to gather grapes
from thorns, nor figs from thistles — We
MUST HAVE REDRESS FROM OUR OWN Laws,
aD NOT FROM THE LAWS OF OUR PLUNDERERS,
ENEMIES, AND OPPRESSORS.”

Translate this into plain words, conveying
a plain meaning—What is it but this—You
ak by what means shall we seek redress P—
We answer, that men in a state of civilized
society, are bound to seek redress for griew
ances by law, as long as any redress can be
obtained by law; but, when all laws are
violated, then that compact by which civilized
society is kept together, is dissolved, and we
bave a right to act for ourselves—That is the
char interpretation of the first part—They
add, “ But how can we expect to gather
grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles.”—
What do they mean by thorns and thistles?
Why the king and the parliament—They as-
sert that they could not expect any redress
from them, or at least from the parliament,
because they could not expect to gather grapes
from thorns, nor figs from thistles.—* We
must have redress, therefore,” they say,
+ from our own laws, and not from the laws of
our plunderers, enemies, and oppressors.” —
What does this mean, but that they must
have redress from a Convention of the Peo-
ple; for this is an address to the people.—
“ We,” therefore, must mean “ the people.”
and “ our own laws,” must mean “ the luws of
the people.”’—We, the people, must have re-
dress from our own laws, and not from the
jaws of our plunderers, enemies, and op-
Pressors—characterizing, by thuse terms, the
constituted authorities of the country.--And
they add, ** There is no redress for a nation
circumstanced as we are, but in a fuir, free,
and full representation of the people.”

Gentlemen, these are declarations clear
and plain. My learned friend called upon
4as to show clear and plain declarations. Can
any thing be more clear and more plain?
dere is no caution used—they had now de-
termined to lay aside all caution—and you
will observe, that my learned friends did not
attempt to say one single word in explanation
of any part of this transaction.—The fair, the
free, and full representation of the people,
which they describe, has been so over and
over again explained, in their own publica-
ions, and in their resolutions and addresses ;
in the report of their committee of constitu-
tion, and elsewhere; that it is utterly unne


cessary for me to go over that ground agai

but merely to observe, that, by a fair, os
and full representation of the people, they
clearly and unquestionably mean, on all oc-
casions, a perfect representation of the peo-
ple, as they sometimes ble it; namely, a
representation of the people, in an assembly
which should act as a National Convention,
like the National Convention of France, by
means of which, every citizen should have
the right of sharing in the government of the
country, legislative and executive.—Then.

here, gentlemen, they have clearly an

openly declared their resolution to have such
a convention of the people, and to create @
ll upon the principles of the Rights of

an.

Now, gentlemen, if a man had proclaimed,
in this country, the pretender, and there!
declared his intention to establish upon the
throne of this country, that family which has
been driven from it, instead of that which hag
since been placed upon the thrune, nu man
would have entertained the slightest doubt,
that the mere act of proclaiming the pre-
tender, would have been treason; and my
learned friends will recollect, that, in the
course of the trial of Mr. Layer, the very
case is supposed by the counsel for the crown.
They say, in answer to an objection with re-
spect to evidence, “ Suppose a man should
have proclaimed the pretender, and then have
gone away, and the proclairation could not

found, what would be the effect of that?
Could not you give, in evidence, the contents
of that proclamation?’—‘ Yes,” says Mr.
Hungerford, the counsel for the prisoner, and
who was no way a friend to that government,
“ the very act of doing that, would be, in it-
self, an overt act of high treason.” .

Then, if proclaiming the pretender is an
overt act of high treason, is there any dif-
ference betwcen proclaiming the pretender,
and proclaiming a republican government?
And this is a proclamation for a republican
government.—I do nut mean to say, that alll
the consequences were immediately to fullow ;
that the king of the country was tu be con-
sidered, as from that moment, depused.—
This appears to be rather a proclamation that
there shall be such a government; not that
it shall instantly take place, but that it shadé
be established, and that they will take steps
for the purpuse.—And you will remember,
that, in the case of treason, a plan once
formed, und steps taken in pursuance of it, is
sufficient tu constitute treason; and it is not
necessary that the steps should be effectual
for the purpose.

Then they come to the following resolu-
tion:

“ Resolved, That during the ensuing ses-
sion of parliament, the general cumnuttee of
this society do meet daily, for the purpese of
watching the proceedings of the p:rlament,
and of ‘the administration of the government
of this country.” —This, and the following re-

solution, they borrow from the British Con-
vention, whose proceedings they had approv-
ed, droping only that part of the resulution
of the British Convention which they thought
it not sate to introduce into their minutes ;
namely, that part respecting an invasion —
* Resulved, That, upon the first introduction
of any bill, or motion, inimical to the liberties
of the people; such as landing foreign troops

mation; or any other innovation of a similar
nature. hut, on any of these emergencies”
—words which leave an openitg fur almost
any thing—That, on any of these emer-
gencies, the general committee shall issue
summonses to the delegates of each division,
and also to the secretaries of the different so-
cieties athliated and corresponding with this
society, furthwith to call a general convention
of the people, to be held at such place, and in
such manner, as shall be specified in the
summons for the purpose of taking such mea-
sures into their consideration.”

Gentlemen, you will recollect, that just at
this time the society for Constitutional In-
formation (who were always acting in their
way in support of the measures first adopted
by the London Corresponding Society) thought

roper to clect Barrére, St. André, and Ro-
dist, honorary members of their society;
declaring, that they considered those mer as
“ the most enlightened friends of Freedom”—
“ judicious,” I think, they likewise call them.
Gentlemen, the mere election of these per-
sons to be members of their society is, in
some degree, adopting their principles; but
when in the very act of election they declare
that they so elect them because of their prin-
ciples—-when men elect a person into a situa-
tion because they consider him as one of the
most judicious and enlightencd friends of Free-
dom—when upon a political subject, they de-
clare they consider the principles of that man
to be those of a judicious and enlightened
man; they really transfer all declared and
avowed principles from the person so elected
to their own society, and make them in effect
the principles of their own socicty. You will
recollect, they follow this up afterwards hy
the publishing to the world their resolution
for insertion of the speeches of Barrére and
St. André upon the subject of the execution
of the king of France in their minutes; and
then you will particularly recollect the man-
ner in which Barrére in his spcech describes a
National Convention.

Upon the first question, “ whether the per-
son of the king is invivlable,” he describes
that which seems to me to be very important
to recall to your attention, aithough the at-
torney-general remarked upon it very consi-
derably in the observations which he made
upon it. Barrére says, that— The people of
Paris, by making an holy insurrection against


the king on the 10th of August, deprived bim
of his character of inviolability; the people of
the other departments applauded this insar.
rection, and adupted the consequence of it; the
people have therefore formally interposed ty
destroy this royal inviolability ; the tacit con-
sent of the peuple rendered the person of the
king inviolable; the act of insurrection wasa
tacit repeal of that consent, and was foundedor
the same grounds of law as the consent itself,
The king’s person is inviolable ouly with
relation to the other branches of the legis
ture, but not with relation to the people.”

Calling the attention of the public to these
speeches, which is equal to publishing then,
shows the intent with which these
were proceeding; and that when they had as
sembled a general convention of the people,
supposing that convention to be approved of
by the other parts of the country, they would
have considered the people as having tormaly
interposed their power to destroy the royal
inviolability. For the assembling a conven
tion of the people, acting as such, and sup-
ported by the power of the people, must of
Necessity have been an insurrection of the

ople against the existing government; and
if the people in general, according to the sys-
tem of Barrére had applauded this tmsurrectioa,
and adopted the consequence of it, the people
would have formally interposed to destroy the
royal inviolability, and all the consequences
which are stated in this speech of Barrére
must have followed.

The speech proceeds to discuss whether an
appeal should ie made to the people, and be
says---‘The people are the Suvereign. A
convention is a perfect representation of the
sovereign; the members of the legislative
assembly acted in August upon these pnnc-
ples in summoning the Convention ; They de-
clare that they saw but one measure which
could save France, namely, to have recourse
to the supreme will of the people, and to m-
vite the people to exercise immediately that
unalienable right of Sovereiznty which the
constitution had acknowledged, and which it
could not subject to any restriction.” then be
says—‘ The public interest required that tae
people should manifest their will by the elec-
tion of a National Convention, formed of repre-
sentatives invested by the people with unl
mited powers; the people did manifest their
will by the election of that Convention; the
Convention being assembled is itself that sove-
reign will which ought to prevail; it would
be contrary to every principle to suppose that
the Convention is not exclusively the expres-
sion of the general yill.”

These societies, then, having declared that,
under certaincircumstances,there should forte
with be called a general convention of the peo-
ple; and having, at the same time, adverted
to the principles so laid down by Barrere, as
the principles of a man whom they th: ta
judicious and enlightened friend of fi m,
they must have considered a convention of the

aS =

people as an assembly of the nature stated in
this speech of Barrére, and upon which I have
before so much observed.

Afterwards at a meeting of the committee
on the 23d of January, it was resolved, that

the toasts drank at the anniversary dinner of |

the society should be printed at the end of the
address. These toasts testify their approba-
tion of “ the British Convention at Edinburgh”

—of “ Skirving, charged by the sentence of the |

Court of Justiciary with the honour of being
the cause of calling that convention” — of
“the London Corresponding Society, and the
several other societies’—-and then of “ their

condemned delegates.” Then there is the '

following toast—“ Success to the arms of
freedom against whomsoever directed, and
confusion to despots with whomsoever allied.”

. These words, though they do admit of another

interpretation, yet are in themselves general ;
and, considering the complexion of the whole
of this transaction, they apply most directly
to that which was the object of the meeting,

. Ramely, the establishment, by force, of a con-
: vention of the people, for the purpose of

effecting, as they conceived, their own free-
dom; a measure to which, it is perfectly
clear, under certain circumstances, they meant
to have recourse. There is another toast
which has a degree of ridicule in it, but you
will see clearly what was meant. Mr. Barlow
had said in his letter to the French Convention,
that it had been completely shown that a king


| On the 27th of March the prisoner wrote 2
| letter to the Constitutional Society, in which
he stated—“I am directed by the London
Corresponding Society to transmit the follow-
ing resolutions to the Society for Constitu-
tional Information, and to request the senti--
ments of that society respecting the important.
measures which the present juncture of affairs
seems to require. The London Corresponding
Society conceives that the moment is arrived
when a full and explicit declaration is neces-
sary from all the friends of freedom.” There-
fore this letter of the prisoner declares, that
that moment was arrived which is alluded to in
the preceding resolutions of the 20th of
January ; and then he adds—* the Society for
Constitutional Information is therefore re-
quired to determine whether or no they will
be ready when called upon to act in conjunc-
tion with this and other societies to obtain a-
fair representation of the people; whether
they concur with us in seeing the necessity of
& speedy convention, for the purpose of ob-
taining, in a constitutional and legal manner,
a redress of those grievances under which we
at present labour, and which can only be
effectually removed by a full and fair repre-
sentation of the peuple of Great Britain.
The London Corresponding Society cannot
but remind their friends, that the present
crisis demands all the prudence, unanimity,
and vigour that ever may or can be exerted by:
men and Britons; nor do they doubt but that
manly firmness and consistency will finally,

“allthat is good in every constitution, and

letter of Barlow, and the works of Paine, in

, which the respect of the people of this coun-

gave that toast. And here I may observe,
that in many of the State Trials you will find

Gentlemen, here is a tull declaration in this
letter, written by the prisoner atthe bar, that
he looked forward to the actual accomplish-
ment of all his wishes. What those wishes .
were has been already fully and sufficiently
declared. They were—to establish in this
country a representative government, founded
upon the broad basis of the rights of man—the
annihilation of monarchy—the annihilation
of what he calls aristocracy—the annihilation
of all ranks and distinctions of men, and
giving equal active citizenship, and an equal
right to every individual in the government
or his country, legislative and executive—in
fine, the complete establishment of a whole

Republican government, without a king, with-

_Geatlemen, the previous resolutions of the
ath of January show what object it was that
they really had in view, namely, the establish-
Trent (under the words “ fair, free, and full
Tepresentation of the people in a house of real
National representatives,” and the other words
of which I have taken notice) of a complete
Republican government. They likewise showed
the manner imwhich they meant to redress.
these grievances which they here state;
wher in their prior resolutions of the 20th of.
January they said—that they could not ex-
fect redress from any existing authority—
that they considered themselves as persons
whe, though they had been in a state of
ivilized society, were now authorized to con-
sider that association. as at an end, no.

tions of the 20th of January, pamely, that te
crisis was asrived upon which they wee &
act.—-

“ Citizens—The critical moment is amd,
and Britons must either assert with zeal sd
firmness their claims to liberty, or yicld with-
out resistance to the chains that ministersl
usurpation is forging for them. Will youee
operate with us in the only peaceable measm
that new presents itself with any prospect d

of this important truth. If we are to be beso

sentences, we are unworthy—we are incap
of liberty. We must be, however, tious.

the purpose for which all that clamour
raised upon the Hessian core being
for a temporary purpose, in this countsy;
they clearly show that the clamour was wed
with effect upon the several country societies,
for the purpose of inducing them to ake

the public mind)—but taking upon itself by
degrees, and showing its intention to take
upon itself whenever it shall be strong enough
a0 todo, the whole authority of the govern-
ment of the country.— We have a central
situation in our view, which we believe would
be most convenient for the whole Island, but
which we forbeas to mention (entreating your
confidence in this particular) till we have the
answer of the societies with which we are in
correspondence.” Gentlemen, the place of
meeting of this convention was to continue a
secret. And here is another instance of that
secrecy which we find throughout every mea-
sure, and which most clearly demonstrates
that their intentions were not honest.

Gentlemen, this circular letter produced
answers. Some of them have been read to
you. The Norwich letter, which is dated the
29th of April, says, “ it is with great satisfac-
tion we view the manly conduct of you and
your eollesgas especially when surrounded,
as you are, by adomineering aristocracy, who,
hotwithstanding their great bluster, are but
chicken-hearted.” It concludes, ‘ we should
be glad to know whether the friends of the
people consent to a convention, and whether
they will take an active part.” A letter dated
the 11th of May, 1794, was sent from the
Sheffield Societies, which states a meeting in
the open air at Halifax, in order to consider
measures Preparatory to a general convention.
This letter says, “ they were advised by us to
defer at present the meeting of delegates until
farther information, which should come from
you” (meaning the prisoner) “ on that sub-
ject.” So that the thing was continually
proceeding ; for this is dated the 11th of May,

* and you will recollect that upon the 12th this
unfortunate man was arrested.

There is a letter written by the prisoner on
the 1st of May, 1794, which clearly and di-
rectly states the ideas he had formed upon
what were to be the consequences of the mea-
sures they were about to adopt. It is in an-
swerto a letter from Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
on the 24th of April, 1794, which says, “ Be-
ing charmed with your masterly and bold ap-

_ probation of the conduct of your delcgates,
and noble martyrs for truth, Margarot and
Gerrald, and finding your name signed as
secretary to the Corresponding Society, we
wish to copy your example, and beg, if you
think us worth your notice, you will give us
your views and intentions as soon as conve-
nient, which I hope will be a means to stimu-
late and increase our numbers.” They had
heard nothing of the convention, because this
society was just formed. They conclude with |
a—“ Farewell, hoping the hydra of tyrann
and imposition shall soon fall under the guil-
lotine of truth and reason.” To this the pri-
soner, on the ist of May, writes this answer—
“It is with pleasure the London Correspond-
ing Society hear that a society on a similar
plan, and with the same patriotic objects in
view, is likely to be established at Newcastle-


upon-Tyne. If ever a ctisis arrived that
required the exertions of the people, to stop

the current of corruption, infamy, and despo-
tism that seems likely to overwhelm them, it
is the present. In God's name then let us
use the exertions—we are called upon by every
thing that is dear to us as men, and as Chris-
tians. The cause of truth and liberty must
rally be omnipotent, therefore doubt not

at the glorious reign of liberty and equality
will ere Tong be established, and modern go-
vernments, with every appendage of wicked-
ness and corruption, will flee in time from
their genial influence, as beasts of prey
to their dens of rapine and darkness from the
rising sun.” Certainly alluding to that which
has been in their minds from the moment of
that address of the Society for Constitutional
Information to the National Convention of
France, in which they represent what has
passed in America as a faint light, but that a
great and brilliant light was to burst forth
upon man. That sun of reason which was ta
arise and illumine the whole world, was to
come from the East—from France—betore the
genial influence of which, modern govern-
ments, with every appendage of wickedness
and corruption, should flee. There is no pos-
sibility of doubting that in this letter the pri-
soner has viciwals adopted the proceedings
then going forward. He adds, “ the London
Corresponding Society have beheld, with in-
dignation, the rapid advances of despotism in
Britain, aud are ready cordially to unite with
every other society in the three kingdom:
who have for their object a full and effect
representation of the people. They therefore
have deputed six of their members to meet
six members of the Society for Constitutional
Information, to form a.Committee of Corres-
pondence and co-operation. ‘This committee
Meets regularly twice a week at No. 2, Beau-
fort Buildings, Strand,”’—which you recollect
was the place where Thelwall’s lectures were
delivered—-“ where any member delegated by
your society will meet with every inform-
ation required.”

You see, therefore, that the prisoner himself
states on the istof May, 1794, not that no-
thing was doing, but on the contrary, that the
Committce of Comes ndence and Co-opera-
tion, by means of which the whole measure
was to be effected, were regularly meeting
twice a week in Beaufort Buildings, where
any member delegated by this Newcastle So-
ciety would meet with every information re-
quired. The letter concludes thus—*‘ We in-
close you a few of our resolutions, entered into
at our general meeting on the 14th of April,
which will be sufficiently explanatory of our
sentiments and views. We heartily unite
with you in wishing that the hydra of tyranny
and imposition may soon fallunder the guillo-
tine of truth and reason”—repeating the words
which had been used by their correspondent.

Gentlemen, intervening transactions had
taken place; namely, the proceedings at

4N

Chalk Farm on the 14th of April, and the
proceedings at Sheffield on the 7th of April.
You will recollect that the meeting at Chalk
Farm was originally intended to have been on
the 7th of April, and from this letter it ap-
fears that general meetings at the same time
were intended to have been had throughout
the whole country. The proceedings at Shef-
field, of which we have a very particniar acy
count, seems to me to show the whole intent
and object of all these men. The person who
acted principally there was a Mr. Yorke,
whofh you have seen before in the character
of delegate trom the Society for Constitutional
Information to the convention assembled in
Edinburgh, but who never went to that meet-
ing. I believe ill health was the occasion, or
perhaps that disapprobation of their measures
which he stated in conversation, and of which
evidence has heen given. At this meeting at
Sheffield Mr. Yorke comments first of all upon
a variety of measures, and upon the nature of
the government of the country, which were,
ax he pppoe, the subjectsin the contempla-
tion of all the persons assembled upon that
occasion. These proceedings seem to have
been prepared before-hand, and to have been
given immediately in the form of a printed
paper. He then adverts to that which is ad-
verted'to in the proceedings of the Socicty‘for
Constitutional Information, and in those of
the Corresponding Society ; the supposed idea
of introducing a mercenary army into the
country for the purpose of preventing the
meeting of the people in convention. He
says— It is doing too much honour to inno-
cent subjects to be alarmed ata few pages of
writings or ata few fugitive orations, when
barracks are erected in a country, and sixty
thousand armed mercenaries are ready to exe-
cute the mandates of government ;” he then
states, “ the day is at length arrived when
fanaticism and superstition, deprived of their
tinsel trappings, and exposed in their native
ugliness to the views of mankind, slink scow]-
ing back to the cave of obscurity. There I
hope they will for ever remain.”

The use of this language, almost similar to
that used in the letter of Hardy which I have
before noted to you, shows the general cor-
respondence and communication between
those parties, and the manner in which they
borrowed, one from the other, the expressions
which they made use of. The fanaticism and
superstition to which he alludes, are the fanati-
cism and superstition which include the preju-
dices which men generally have in favour of
the established government of their country.
He adds, “ The energy of Englishmen will no
ionger endure this strange uproar of injustice.”
The paper states, that “ the people then came
to these resolutions,” which resolutions were
not heard by, and not knownto, far the
greater part of the persons there assembled,
and they are stated to have heen adopted with
the exception of one or two persons present—
* First, that the people, being the true and


only source of government, the freedom of
speaking and writing upon any subject cannot
be denied to the members of a free govern-
ment, without offering the it insult to
the majesty of the people.”

Second, that therefore the condenmatson
ofcitizens Muir, Palmer, Skirving,
and Gerrald to transportation for exposing the
corruptions of the British Government, wx
an act better suited to the remains of a despo-
tic than a free government.”

“ Third, that the address which has now
been read, be presented to the king in behalf
of the above persecuted patri
dress you: will find at the beginning of the
Printed proceedings, and it is one of the 2i-
Grosses to the king contained im those pe
ceedings. :

s — next: raoved, that a petition be
presented to the House of Commons for a re-
form in the representation ef the people is
a aap but so marked was the disappro-

tion given by the whole meeting to this
measure, that not one single person secended
the motion, buta most profound silence, inter-
rupted only by a few murmurs, was observed.”

Gentlemen, you will recollect that it is m
evidence before you that the motion for a pe-
tition to be presented to the House of Com
mons was alla contrivance; that it was nos
intended that the propriety of presenting any
such petition should be seriously bat
that it should be brought forward by a persca
in concert with this Henry Yorke, merely for
the purpose of being rejected.

“Upon which Henry Yorke again arose and
addressed the meeting in an aninzated speech
of an hour long, and of which it is impossible
for us to give our readers a just conception.
He took a general view of the British Const-
tution, and stated its most prominent defects,
among which the wantef a perfect national
representation was the most glaring. He
dwelt a considerable time upon this subject,
and then proceeded farther to comment upos
it’? He then said, “ It was now high tme
that the people should lay aside leaders, cis-
card factions, and act for themselves.” That
the people should lay aside: leaders, discar¢
factions, and act for themselves! In tne
first place, when the London Corresponding
Society had prepared a petition to the House
of Commons, they had applied to Mr. For t
present that petition; Mr. Fox told them, “ As
the request of my constituents unquestionably
I will present this petition; but I tell yor: be
fore hand that I totally disapprove of what
you propose, universal suffrage annaal
per ieneniss ap therefore, I wish you would
apply to some other person to present your
petition.” They must, therefore, have ins
pertectly rie at on any petition which they
might think proper to present to parliament
igen the only.grounds on which they stated
they would be content (for they mever bars
confined themselves within a smaller cosmpes

suffrage and angus

than requiring universal

parliaments) they should be opposed by one
of the most able men in this country, and a
man who, for a great number of years, has
constantly acted in opposition to the king’s
ministers.

They then applied to Mr. Francis, who has
been examined upon this trial—Mr. Francis
says, he told them, explicitly, at the time that
they desired him to present their petition,
that he likewise disapproved of the prayer
of their petition, and that he likewise should
Gree it to the utmost of his power. Gen-

lemen, you will recollect, that they cun-
.cealed from Mr. Francis the purpose for
which this petition was to be presented. He
“was not aware, that they had no serious in-
tention in presenting this petition, and that
their object was only to raise discussion and
discontent ; that was, in no degree, repre-
sented to him, nor were there stated to him a
variety of other circumstances respecting the
transaction. They likewise knew, that the
Society of the Friends of the People would
listen to no such measure. The Correspond-
ing Society had artfully enough continued to
‘keep up correspondence with the Society of
the Friends of the People, after that society
had discarded the society for Constitutional
Information, because they saw that the So-
ciety for Constitutional Intormation was going
to those great lengths, which the Friends of
the People Hieatptevest They knew, there-
fore,that all those persons, who not only
were notin the habit of supporting govern-
ment, but, on the contrary, were in opposition
to it;—-when I say, in support of, and in op-
position to government, I mean in support of
the administration of the government, and, in
opposition to that administration;—they knew
-that all those persons would oppose that very
plan of reform, which those societies meant
.to.introduce. ‘They knew, therefore, that
they could not hope to do any thing in par-
diament, and that a petition to the House of
-Commons must necessarily be nugatory, be-
cause all parties agreed in thinking, that the
plan which they -proposed was inadmissible,
and yet they had expressly declared, that
they would be content-with nothing less.

Mr. Yorke, therefore, told the people at
Sheffield, “1t was now high time that the
ste should lay aside leaders, and discard

ns, and act for themselves.” He strongly
enforced these principles, and then entered
into a complete detail of the ancient consti-
‘tution, as established by Alfred, which he
proved to be at this-time totally defaced, if
Dot lost. He then pursued the gradual de-
-cline of popular liberty in England, from the
-anarchy which was the consequence of Danish

Norman invasion, and taking a general
-sketch of our history, so far as it was con-
nected withthe subject of popular represen-
-tation; he made some strong and pointed re-
marks on the revolution in 1688.—He said,
* that the revolution, at least so far as it re-


compromise between the king and the aristo-
cracy, for the jeint inheritance of the peoples
but to establish, on unequivocal Sa les,
the right of the people, to govern themselves,
end to recall those delegated powers which
they had entrusted to their servants for this
purpose, ‘when they were either abused, or
‘ neglected to exercise them. If the revolu-
| tion were not a revolution for the people, it
was no revolution at all, but a conspiracy of
a few-ennobled oppressors, against the liber-
ties and happiness of the many.—But, if it
were designed ‘to comprehend the whole, and
its end has been perverted, or purposely laid
aside, the people are not warranted in peti-
tioning, but are justified in demanding, us a
right, 3 ly to the tone of language used
in the declaration of rights, the restitution of
| annual parliaments, and the establishment of
universal suffrage.

Then, gentlemen, he proceeds, in an ex-
tremely long speech, to observe upon the ef-
fects of that universal emancipation to which
he looked; saying, that “ oppressed nature
will, at a proper season, depart from passive
principles; and should an attempt be made
to wrest what remains of liberty from us, I
trust all men will concur to vindicate their
violated rights ;” and he concluded with say-
ing, “ When such a revolution of sentiment
shall have dispersed the mists of prejudice ;
when, by the incessant thunderings from the
press, the meanest cottager: of our country
shall be enlightened, and the sux of reason,”
of which we have heard so much, “ shall shine,
in its fullest meridian, over us, then, THE COM-
MANDING VOICE OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE SHALL
RECOMMEND THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-
EIGHTGENTLEMEN IN‘SAINT STEPHEN'S CHAPEL,
TO CO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS.” Then several
resolutions were entered into, one of which
was :— Convinced of this truth, it is the api-
nion of this mest that the people ought
to demand, asa right, and not petition, as a
Savour, for universal representation.” —« That,
therefore, we will petition the House of Com-
mons no more on this. subject.”

It has been attempted to represent this, as
meaning, that they would petition the House
no more, in the character of separate socie-
ties, or individuals; but the resolution is ex-
plicit, and clearly shows, that that was not
what they meant ;. for, they say, ‘ Convinced
of this truth, it is the opinion of this meeting,
that the people ought to demand, asa right,
and not petition, as a favour, for universal re-
presentation: that THEREFORE we will peti-
tion the House of Commons no more on this
subject.” The reason given for petitioning
no more, would apply just as much to peti-
tioning, in the form of a number of persons,
assembled by delegation, at Edinburgh, or
elsewhere, as it would to this meeting at
Sheffield.—Then, as a sort of colour of their
proceedings, and as the means of exciting dis-
content, a long petition was prepared for the

. pected the people, was.not intended to be a } abolition of the slave tradc,

Gentlemen, they speak then of the rejec-
Aion of their petition by the House of Com-
gnons; and they say, “ Our petition was re-
ceived with the utmost indignation, by the
House of Commons, which was no more than
wwe expected ;” and, “ although our petition
was disdainiully rejected, because not couched
in language suthciently polite and respecttul
for the tive hundred and fifty-eight gentlemen,
whu sit in the House of Commons, yet, be-
lieve us, fellow citizens, we are still of opi-
nion, that the matter it contained was not
only just and proper, but we think that even
the languaye, which gave so much offence to
the hon. gentlemen, was much too polite and
too muderate for us. For, if the House of
Commons were the real representatives of the
people, we certainly had a right to dictate and
not to petition.’ ——You will find, throughout
the whole of this transaction, that they had
Now assumed, that they had a right to dictate,
end not to petition.—And you cannot form the
slightest reason to believe, that a petition
to the House of Commons was within their
view.

They conclude :—* But our petition being


the country ; and therefore holding principles
rfectly inconsistent with the present esty
flishment of the British government.
Gentlemen, there are many other passages
which might be observed upon, but I a
afraid I have already infinitely too Jong tres
passed upon your patience. There is ow
subject upon which I have hitherto seid bu
little; I mean the subject of arming. I could
wish, also, if I had strength for the pi ealng
to say something to you upon the subject of
Chalk-farm ; but I am realty unable to doa.
With respect to the subject of arming, asit
assedat Sheffield, what does it show? That,
some means, the minds of the people st
Sheffield, T mean of the people who belonged
to these societies, were impressed with
idea, that some civil commotion was to beer
pected, and that it was, therefore, necessary
for them to provide themselves with arms for
their defence; and I will take it, that thos
witnesses who have appeared here, spoke
perfectly seriously when they said they meant
these arms only for their own defence. Bat
the purpose of Yorke, Davison, and Gale, who
are the only three persons who appear

scouted, we shall trouble them no more with
our coarse and unmannerly language ;—it
-will be our duty to proceed, as we have uni-
formly done hitherto, in enlightening the
public mind, and when a complete revolution
of sentiment shall take place (as will shortly
be the case) in our country, we shall open our
mouths in that key we think most agreeable
£0 ourselves ; and our voice, together with that
of our disfranchised countrymen, will resemble,
perhaps, the thunderings from Mount Sinai.”
Clearly alluding to the idea, that the
opinion of the people, supporting a conven-
tion, assembled and acting as a convention
of the peuple, speaking, therefore, under that
character, the public will, as described in Bar-
rere’s specch, would be irresistible; and that its
‘thunderings would be in that key which the
Persons who composed it should think most
agrecable to themselves, and would resemble
the thunderings of Mount Sinai. Then they
speak of their principles, and say, “ These
essential principles are both easy and com-
prehensive. On these we build our right to
representation, and renvunce the idcu of future
petitions.”
~ So that they cleatly renounce the idea of
future petitions, not simply from themselzcs,
but from any other persons, assuming their
title to universal representation, as a right, and
Not as a thing to be obtaincd by petition :—
By these maxims we find that every Eng-
lishman is free, and that in the clection of a
Supreme magistrate, or in the delegation of le-
Bislatiwe powers, he concedes his actions to a
certain superintendence, for the express pur-
se of preventing liberty from vaulting over its
imits, ‘und introducing a system of universal
Niolence, injury, or licentiousness ;”—applyin

had armed those men for the purpose of

the examination, I think, of one of the wit
nesses for the defendant, that ten thousand
such arms might, at Sheffield, be fabricated
in a day; so that it was unnecessary that the
actual fabrication of arms should be immedi-
ately thought of. Nothing more was wanting
than to put the people in a train, for the pu-
pose of obtaining arms when they should be
wanted, The ie thing | nny al y

As to Tee letter from Davison, itis Drogo
clear, although we cannot trace the fact, thst
it had been communicated by the prisoner, @
some way or other ; otherwise Edwards sev
could have known, that the prisoner was tle
person to apply to, for a direction where ©
get arms at Sheffield. ;

Gentlemen, ata much earlier period, the
persons concerned in this transaction, looked
upon what was going forward, as
leading to extreme anarchy—I allude more
particularly to the letter of Skirving, of the 5th
of July, 1793, to the prisoner at the ba, @
which he clearly and explicitly states, whst
his ideas upon the subject were. In wnitiag
that letter of the 5th of July, 1793, Mr. Skix
ving had it in his contemplation that, by pr
sibility, in a very short time, the whole cou
try might be in anarchy and confusion. Be
says—“ If we sought only the extirpaix®
of one set of interested men from the 1
ment of national affairs, that place might
| given to another set, without affecting U
| vitals adverse to the system of reform, bet


might be easily acéomplished; but to cut up
deep and wide rooted prejudices, to give effec-
tual energy to the dictates of truth, in favour
of public virtue and national prosperity, in
opposition to self, and all its interested habits,
and to withstand, and overawe the final efforts

of the powers of darkness, is the work of the .

whole, and not of a part; a work to which
maokind, till this awful period, were never
adequate, because never till now disposed to
fraternize ; not merely or only, I trust, from
the sense of the common danger to which we
are exposed, but from the ennobling principle
of universat benevolence. I think the minds
of all must, in the nature of thin
turned to more effectual means of reform—
not one person was convinced of the neces-
sity of it by the most convincing arguments
of reason, together, with the most uneqnivo-
cal expressions of universal desire. hat
then is to be hoped for from repetition? I
am only afraid that the bow in England,
against refornt, was so contracted, that in re-
turning it may break. You would willingly
learn, you say, from us; I own that we ought
to be forward in this. We have at once in
great wisdom perfected our plan of organiza-
tion, and it we were in the same independent
state of mind as the people of England, we
should be able to take the lead.”

He proceeds to observe upon the conse-
quences of that plan of organization, which he
says has been established, and the object of
which was, to effect the reforms which he had
proposed. He adds—* The associations with
you are no more, I fear—excuse my freedom
—than an aristocracy for the good of the peo-
ple. They are indeed moderate, firm, and
virtuous; and better cannot be: but we are
the people themselves, and we are the first to
show that the people can both judge and re-
Solve, if undirected by faction, with both wis-
dom and moderation. I have not a higher
wish in the present exertions for reform, than
to see the people universally and regularly
associated, because I am persuaded that the
present disastrous engagements will issue in
ruin, and the people then must provide for
themselves; and it would be unhappy, when
we should be ready to act with unanimity, to
beoccupied about organization, without which,
however, anarchy must ensue.” What can
this advert to but a contemplation in the mind
of Skirving, so early as the 25th of May, 1793,
that things were approaching to such a state,
in this country, that there would be a disso-
lution of the whole of the existing govern
ment; and, if some other government was
Not provided in its place, that anarchy must
ensue? “ Let us, therefore,” (says he) “ take
the hint given us by our opposers. Let us
begin in earnest to make up our minds rela-
tive to the extent of reform which we ought
to seek, to’ be prepared to justify it, and to
Controvert objections, Let us model the
whole in the public mind. Let us provide
@very stake and stay of the tabernacle which


we would erect ; so that when the tabernacles
of oppression, in the palaces of ambition, are
broken down under the madness and folly of
their supporters, we may then, without anar-
chy and all dangerous delay, erect at once our
tabernacle of righteousness, and may the Lord
himself be in it.” é

Now, gentlemen, here is a man contem<
plating that which was likely to be the result
of the measures in which he was en, v-
seeing they led to anarchy and confusion, and
exhorting other persons to be prepareth for
the event, by providing a plan for that new

i government which he meant to establish, in-
be now |

stead of the government which he meant to
destroy. He then proceeds to describe what
was the unfortunate state of the Roman go«
vernment, after the nations which had been
subjected by it, had been left “ like sheep
without a shepherd” clearly alluding to that
state of anarchy wiich at that period prevail.
ed in Europe; a state described in history so
forcibly, and picturing so completely, in many
instances, the present situation of France,
that really when one reads that history, one
almost imagines one is reading the history of
the present state of France.

The letter proceeds—* We may suppose an
event which we deprecate. Nay, should we
not be prepared for every possible issue, at
the present unprecedented divisions of man-
kind? we have a right to be apprehensive of
the abilities ofour own managers, who are so
afraid to depart from precedent, that like men
of detail, they may be inadequate to the task
of preserving the vessel from shipwreck, now
grappling with danger, not only great, but
new and uncommon.” The letter adds—* if
the present ministry fail, who after them
shall be trusted? It requires little penetra-
tion to see the anarchy and discord which
will follow. It will be such, that nothing
short of a general union among the people
themselves, will be able to heal. Haste
therefore to associate, at least to be ready to
associate. If then such a broken state of
things should take place, the civil broils that
would necessarily ensue would soon subside,
before the united irresistible voice of the
whole. Do not, I intreat you, hesitate think-
ing such a work premature as yet; but 2
month, and then it may be too late.” The
sp pcensian upon this man’s mind, unquestion-
ably, was extremely strong—an impression
not at all, indeed, warranted by the event;
his idea was, that the danger was then great
—he looked to the gencral dissolution of go-
vernment—he looked to anarchy and discord
—he looked to civil broils as necessarily ¢n-
suing; and the only hope he had, was in the
united irresistible voice of the whole adopting
some plan, to be actually formed, and ready
to be offered to them upon the instant.

Gentlemen, this letter clearly shows, that
that sort of civil discord had been long in the
contemplation of these parties. Whether
they ever took those means to provide for the

contingencies which might happen, which
the writer of this Ictter recommends, it is
impossible for us to know. All that I can
observe is, that if you look into the report of
the Committee of Constitution of the London
Corresponding Society, I think you will find
a sort of provision, not adapted merely to the
purposes of a private society, but easily con-
vertible to the purposes of a nation actin
ynder the ideas which these societies had o}
the proper manner of governing a country.

Gentlemen, I will make one short remark

m what passed at Chalk Farm, principally
with a view to call to your attention the very
violent resolutions which were intended to
have been adopted at that meeting, by one of
the parties—I likewise would call to your at-
tention, that the system of arming appears to
have been, in some degree, adopted through-
out——as to what was said with respect to
the knives it certainly was a trifling circum-
stance, but the fact is not contradicted, and I
would particularly remark to you, that a per-
gon of the name of Pearce, was named speci-
fically in the evidence of Groves (whose evi-
dence is the only evidence that has been in
any degree materially affected) as one of the
peswns who were present at the transaction.

might have appeared and contradicted
-that assertion ; he has not appeared and con-
tradicted that assertion, he therefore must be
taken, from his silence upon this occasion, to
have assented to the eth of that assertion.

I would likewise observe, that Green, the
man who in some respects contradicts Groves,
was called on the pee of the crown; and I
think that you will believe, that those who
had the management of this business on the
part of the crown, when they called that
man, had no idea of concealing from you an’
circumstance of which they could obtain evi-
dence for your information. He likewise
himself, upon his cross-examination, admit-
ted something which might give some sort
‘of colour to the evidence of Groves—but,

ntlemen, put out of your consideration all
the evidence that Groves has given—put out
of your consideration these knives, and a
thousand other little trifling circumstances—
you will find all the parol evidence given,
confirmed by the written papers—you will
find not one word of that parol evidence con-
tradicted, except so far as the evidence of
Green, one of the witnesses on the part of
the crown, contradicts the evidence of Groves,
another witness on the part of the crown, in
this single circumstance—at the same time
that hundreds and hundreds of people might
have contradicted the test part of tl

1 evidence which has been given, if it had

en thought safe for the prisoner to bring
those persons to the bar.

” You will likewise recollect the paper of the
Ins and Outs, which was certainly an incite-
ment to arm, exactly upon the same principle
es that which was proceeded upon at Shef-
field, ineiting the people to provide arms for


[1292

self-defence—the persons who 36 inciaj
them, having no reason whatever for incitiag
them to arm, for any particular object, at thir
moment, but simply for the purpose of pre
viding with arms the persons whom they
meant afterwards to make use of, and having
the power to refrain from telling them the
application which they meant to make df
them, till the moment when it would be oo
venient for them to do so.

Gentlemen, I have addressed you beyood
my strength.—I feel myself unable to sv
any thing more, though I am well
indeed I well recollect, there are many things
I meant to have stated, which I mre _

which T have found not only difficult to

deavoured to discharge it faithfully. Having
done so, I will now trouble you no longer.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—We are at the
seventh day of this trial ; and it comes tom
now to sum up this great and momentos
cause. Is it expected or wished, on the pat
of the prisoner particularly, , and also oa the
part of the prosecutor, that the whole of ths
written evidence should be repeated to be
jury? or, would it be satisfactory to eve

ly, that the parol evidence only should be
summed up to the jury, that they should be
left to their recollection of the written ev
dence, together with the production of st
parts of the written evidence, as, 0
course of the summing up, it may appet
to me to be necessary to have recourse to

Mr. Attorney Generel.—On the pest

rosecution, it appears to me, that I cannot

tter consult the interest of the public, than

to leave the execution of this uty to that
discretion which presides here.

‘Mr. Erskine.—I shall net express my own
sentiment, because the attorney-general has
expressed my sentiment completely.—I leave
it entirely to the discretion of your lordship;
and Mr. Hardy desires me to state his confi-
dence in the justice of the Court, and to ex-
press his acquiescence in the mode your lord-
ship proposes.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Then I will
take that course.—If, in summing ups there
is any paper I should not state, which the
counsel on either side, and particularly the
counsel for the prisuner, should think may
throw light on what I do state, if they will be

SUMMING UP.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre—Gentlemen of
‘the Jury ;—The prisoner at the bar, Thomas
Hardy, stands indicted for that he, together
with John Horne Tooke—John Augustus
Bonney—Steward Kyd—Jeremiah Joyce—
Thomas Wardle—Thomas Holcroft—John
Richter—Matthew Moore—John Thelwall—
Richard Hodgson, and John Baxter—has
compassed and imagined the death of the
king:—the language of the charge is—
“That they conspired, compassed, imagined
and intended, to stir up, move and excite in-
surrection, rebellion and war, against the
king, within this kingdom of great Britain,
and to subvert and alter the legislature, rule
government therein established, and to
depose the king from the royal state, title,
power and gosernment of this kingdom ; and,
to bring and put the king to death, and to
fulfil, perfect, and bring to effect their trea-
sons and treasonable compassings and imagi-
nations aforesaid,” they committed several
evert acts, which are charged in this indict-
ment.—The first overt act charges “ their
meeting, consulting, conspiring and agrecing
to cause and procure a convention and meet-
ing of the king’s subjects to be assembled
within the kingdom, with intent, and in
order that the persons so to be assembled,
might, without and in defiance of the autho-
rity, and against the will of the Parliament,
subvert, alter, and cause to be subverted an
altered, the legislature, rule and government
now established, and to depose, and cause to
be deposed, the king from the ory state,
title, power and government thereof.”
__ The second overt act charges him with “ writ-
ing composing and publishing (the more readily
and effectually to assemble stich convention for
the traitorous purposes aforesaid, and thereby
to accomplish the same) divers books, pamph-
lets, letters, instructions, resolutions, orders,
declarations, addresses, and writings, pur-
porung, and containing therein, incitements,
encquragements and exhortations, to move,

chosen, deputed, and sent, persons, as dele-
gates, to compose and constitute such con-
vention.” .

The third overt act charges them “ with
meeting, consulting and deliberating the more
readily and effectually to assemble such con-
vention, for the traitorous purposes aforesaid,
concerning the calling andassemblingsuchcpn- .
vention, and how, when, and where the same
should be assembled and held, and by what
means the subjects of our said lord the king
should and might be induced and moved to
send persons, as delegates, to compose and
constitute the same.” ‘

The fourth overt act charges them with

pose, that Jeremiah Joyce—John Augustus
Bonney—John Horne Tooke—Thomas War-
dle-—Matthew Moore—John Thelwall—John
Baxter—Richard Hodgson—John Lovett—
William Sharpe, and John Pearson, should
meet, confer and co-operate among them=
selves, for and towards the calling and assem-
bling such convention.”

The fifth overt act is for “ causing and pro-
curing to be madeand provided, andconsenting,
and agreeing to the making and providing of
diversarms and offensive weapons; that istosay
guns, muskets, pikes and axes, forthe purpose
of arming divers subjects of our said lord the
king, in order and to the intent that the same
subjects should and might, unlawfully, fore
ci , and fraitorously oppose and withstand
our lord the king, in the due and lawful exer-
cise of his royal power and authority, in the
execution of the laws and statutes of this
realm, and should and might, unlawfully, for-
cibly, and'traitorously subvert and alter, and
aid and assist in subverting and altering,
without and in defiance of the authority, and
against the will of the parliament of this king-
dom, the legislature, rule and government
established in this kingdom, and to depose,
and to aid and assist in deposing the king

and with dispersing the same, containing
therein, incitements, encouragements and ex-
hortations to move, induce and persuade the


subjects of our said'lord the king, to aid and | he said, he heard nothing of any other sort

assist in carrying into effect such traitorous
subversion, alteration and deposition, and also
containing therein, information, instructions
and directions to the subjects of our said lord
the king, how, when and upon what occasions
the traitorous purposes last aforesaid, should
and might be carried into effect.”

The ninth overt act charges the “ pro-
curing and providing arms and offensive
weapons, (to wit) guns, muskets, pikes and
axes, therewith to levy and wage war, insur-
rection and rebellion against our said lord
the king, within this kingdom.”

Forthe present, gentlemen, you will attend to
the evidence, with a view only to the establish-
ment of some or other of tliose facts which
ase so charged as overt acts, the general effect
ef the evidence I shall take occasion to state
to you, with observations upon it, when I
come to state. the whole of the evidence to-
gether.

. The first witness that was called, after the
written evidence was in a great measure gone
through, was William Camage, who said, he
was a member of the society at Sheffield; that
he became so the latter end of the year 1791;
that he acted as secretary, he believes, five or
six months ; he ceased to act in that capacity
about the latter end of April or May last—he
used to sign the letters, which were often
written by others—the business of the society
was managed by different persons—there was
@committee—the leading persons of the com-
mittee were one David Martin, who used to
attend the committee ; John Allcock, George
Widdison and Matthew Lodwin—they were

‘sons concerned in writing these letters—
thatthe professed object they had in view,
was a parliamentar felon thee they chose
Matthew Campbell Brown a delegate to the
Scotch Convention, and that he was sent to
Brown at Edinburgh, by the Society to carry
him cash. He says, there was, at first, a
parliamentary reform proposed to be brought
about by petition to parliament. Being
asked what was theirnext measure, supposing
peed ieee was rejected, he said, he never
heard any other specific plan, proposed by
Mr. Yorke, or pointed out by him.

_He says, the society was threatened to be
dispersed in their meetings, by the people of
Sheffield, by the opposite party; that they
thought it necessary that they should have
arms for their own defence; and he approved
of it; he did not see any harm in the business;
but they had a right to be armed for their own
defence, against any illegal attack from that
party, and to protect their meetings; this, he
said, was the gencral idea amongst a great
many, whose names he could not mention at
present, he says, Mr. Yorke approved the
idea. He was shown the blade ofa pike ; he
said, it was shown to Mr. Yorke by Henry
Hill, who is here as a witness, who is a shoe-
. maker's knife forger ; as well ashe recollects,

it was Hill who made that blade of the pike ;

1

arms, and nothing of arms in any other coz.
try; he said, he did not know of any quanutr
being made, excepting three dozen, whi:
were made, he believes, by Hiil; he sx.
he saw a pike handle at Widdison’s; :
was about eight or nine o'clock at night, wie:
he went to Yorke’s about it; that no pen:
was pregent.

He says, he was at the meeting upc tix
Castle Hill, at Sheffield; that, at that tm:,
there was no recommendation of arms. He
says, he knew Davison, who was servant |
Gale; and he also knew Robert Moody. Yorte
recommended, that parliament should not be
petitioned ; he heard of an addre-s to te
people; he says, that Yorke was drawn hex

in a carriage, without horses ; be heard Yor
disapprove of the Scotch Convention ; fa k
thought the people were very much uopr-
jared.
P Hc proves a letter produced, to be «dk
Davison’s hand, addressed to Hardy, and th:
he had seen it m Davison’s possesswn s:
Sheftield. Davison, he says, came origins
from Leeds ; and he acted as secretary ¥
Lecds. Le says, he desired thata letter fm

he never heard that the proposed convention
was, to pnt down the king and the parliament,
and to take upon themselves the functions of
government; the Sheffield Society thought
that the Scotch Convention would petition,
and that the House of Commons would
attend to the application of a large num-
ber when a small number of individuals

- might be neglected; that he should have
thought himself the most abandoned of
mankind, if he had continued a member of
the society, if they had taken up such senti-
ments ; he said, he had never any reason to
believe that there was an intent to destroy
the constitution. He said, they were afraid
of the opposite party making an attack upon
them; they thought what they were doing
was legal; they had no intention of arming
against the king and parliament; he would
not have remained another day in that so-
ciety, if that had been the use intended to be

le of these arms; but he thought they had
a right to have arms for theit own defence,
upon the Bill of Rights, against any of those
people that might attack them: Yorke said it
was so. He could not take upon himself to
tell what the delegates of the convention
meant to do. - He believes it was the cheap-
hess of the article that recommended the
pikes. As to the cat, he did not know that
any were made from the model ; he had seen
some years ago, something of that kind at
Neweastle; and, as he recollects, as to the
time, it was some time about the American
war; the letter alluded to in this man’s evi-
dence, is addressed to “ Citizen Hardy, No. 9
Piccadilly, London.”

__“ Fellow Citizen ; the barefaced aristocracy
of the present administration has made it ne-
cessary that we should be prepared to act on
the defensive, against any attack they may
command their 1ewly-armed minions to make
upon us. A pian has been hit upon, and if en-
couraged sufficiently, will, no doubt, have the
effect, of furnishing a quantity of pikes to
the patriots great enough to make them
formidable, the blades are made of steel tem-
pered and polished after an approved form ;
they may be fixed into any shafts, but fir ones
are recommended of the girt of the accom-
panying hoops at the top, and about an inch
more at the bottom; the blades and hoops,
more than which cannot be properly sent to
any great distance, will be charged one shil-
ling; money to be sent with the orders. As
the institution is in its infancy, immediate
eNcouragement is necessary.” They have
strvek nut “ Orders may be sent to the secre-
tary of the Shetheld Constitutional Society.

“ Sheffield, (Signed) Ricuarp Davison.”
“ April 24, 1794.”

“To pet post suspicion, direct to Mr.
Robert Moody, joiner, Cheney Square, Shef-
field. Please to forward the enclosed.”

The witness ssys, Davison might have



the same views for the people in London as
the witness had in Sheffield; he says the
pikes would cost about twenty pence. Being
asked if he ever heard of such a place as the
Parrot in Green Arbour Allev, London, he
says he does not know any thing ofit.

The next witness is William Broomhead,
he is a cutler at Sheffield, and was a mem-
ber of the Constitutional Society there at its
first institution in 1791; he says he did not
know that he was one of the twelve who
were associated with the London Constitu-
tional Society ; he has some idea of a letter
having been written that they might act in
conjunction, but never heard of the associa-
tion ; he was secretary of the society in Shef-
field for the last five months before he was
apprehended, which was in April; he says
the object of the society was a parliamentary
reform, by meeting and endeavouring to en-
lighten each other, and to spread the know-
ledge of grievances, that they might unitedly
apply in the most unexceptionable mode for a
teform of parliament; the term universal
suffrage he did not hear of till the Edinburgh
Convention; he says he knows Yorke, w
sometimes goes by anothcr name, by the
name of Redhead, he resided at Sheffield se-
veral times ; he cannot tell exactly how long,
the last time might be six, seven, or eight
weeks. The witness knows Gale; he says
Yorke used to attend the weekly mectings
during his last visit at Sheffield, but he was
not a settled inhabitant of the place ; that he
was considered as a man of considerable abi-
lities, and an orator, and treated with respect ;
he said he wrote several pamphlets at Shef-
field; he used to bring parts of them to be
read to the society at these meetings.

The society held these meetings in a small
and in a large room; there was an elevation
for the speaker, which some called the pulpit,
some the tribune; from this tribune Mr.
Yorke addressed the society. He was at the
meeting upon the Castle-hill, Mr. Yorke was
there, and expatiated very largely upon the
corruptions which had crept into the consti-
tution, or rather the evils complained of; he
says his manner of speaking sometimes car-
ried him farther than he ought, he was pecu-
liarly energetic, fiery, very warm, very strong,
but that he said nothing contrary to the law
and constitution.

He says it was settled ata previous meet-
ing, that he the witness, should make a mo-
tion for a petition to the House of Commons,
in order that it might be over-ruled, for the
purpose of introducing another motion in its
place ; he says he made his motion and it was
objected to, with a view to the introducing
another; he says there were four of them of
the committee, himself and three more—that:
several people were assembled ; the new mo-
tion was, to petition his majesty, it was drawn
up before they assembled, for a reform in
parliament; that Mr. Yorke addressed the
people, that the petition was sent to London

ment —— Committee Room, March 20th,
1794—Resolved, that the society approve the
sentiments contained in the serious Lecture
delivered -to the Cunstitutional Society at

Sheffield, on the twenty-eighth of last month,
and earnestly recommend it to the perusal

- Resolved, that the comman:ling a gene-

destroying our fellow-creatures, is repugnant
tothe true spirit and principles of christianity,

great part of the people are unacquainted
with the nature of the present war, either as
to its justice or necessity, every endeavour
being used to keep them ignorant of the real
Principles and designs fur which it was com-
menced, to approach and to supplicate the
Omniscient Power under such circumstances,
and for such a purpose, must indeed be dread-
ful, since knowledge and conviction are
wanting ; the worse than hypocritical hearts
of those who are the authors of such a mea-
sure, although they at present impose upon
the ignorant and credulous by such detestable,
such pretended show of devotion, cannot es-
cape the chastisement of that Power whom
they thus insult, and from whose judgment
there is no appeal.

“ T. Harpy, secretary.”

The next paragraph is :—‘ Society for Con-
stitutional Information, March 21st, 1794.

“ Resolved, that the secretary of this so-
ciety be directed to write to the Friends of
Peace and Reform, at Sheffield, and to assure
them, that this society views, with pleasure,
their steady exertions to ubtain a fair repre-
sentation of the people of Great Britain, in
parliament, and the proper methods which
they have taken to employ, usefully, those
days which‘may be appointed for public fasts.

“ D. Apams, secretary.”

' This publication, and the resolutions thus


entered into, on the Fast-day, at Sheffield, re-
ceived the approbation of both societies, the
Constitutional, and also the London Corres-
ponding Socicty .

William Broomhead goes on with his evi-
dence :—he says, that the society consists of
about six hundred ; that they never amounted
to many more; certainly not to two thou-
sand, they had been represented to be of
that number in some papers, which led to
this explanation. The distribution inte di-
visions, or sections, was not regularly kept;
that they were to meet as they thought pro-
per; but that they were to cullect a penny a
week each, to ake a fund; he says, that
that part of the business was not properly at-
tended to; the district mectings were nvt re-
gularly and properly attended to.—tle says,
that a gentleman, from Halifax read the lec
ture, and that the pamphlets were sold, but
they had not a very extensive sale; the wit-
ness himself composed a prayer that was
used upon the occasion; the copy was deli-
vered to the printer, and it was settled, at a
private meeting of some of the members, that
it should be so printed.

They next go to the proceedings at Shef-
field, in the open air, on the seventh of April,
1794, which are also in print, and were tound
upon the prisoner, which, I think, should be
read to you.—I have only to observe, at pre-
sent, upon this paper, that, as to the general
libellous turn of it, nothing very material to
the present question ariscs, but that there is
one passage in the petition, which may be
very material for your consideration, where
he talks of an impending storm, connecting
that with the date, which is the seventh of
Apri], 1794, it may be hereafter matter for
your consideration.

/ [See pp. 613, et seg.]

I thought it necessary that the whole of
this paper should be read, because the paper
has been very much relied upon in the cause,
and because different constructions have been
put upon it by the counsel in support of the
prosecution, and by the counsel on the part of
the prisoner: the importance of it is not
drawn so much from its general extravagance,
as it is from the particular circumstance that
it purports to resulve, that the body that
were then assembled at Sheffield, would peti-
tion parliament no more, and would try some
other course; what was meant by petitioning
parliament no more, and what was meant by
trying some other course, will be a sulject for
your deliberations when you take this paper,
with all the circumstances that preceded it,
and that followed it, keeping in your minds,
that this is a paper which was published
among a very numerous set of people, assem-
bled at Shefheld, just about the time that the
proposition for a convention of the people
was under consideration, in a committee of
correspondence and co-operation of the two
societics, the Constitutional and Correspond-

ing Societies, in London, and that this paper
was found in the hands of Hardy, the prisoner
at the bar, the secretary of one of these so-
cieties; at present, I make no farther obser-
vation upon this paper, only recommendin;

to you, as far as you can, to keep the genera!
import of it in your minds, that you may un-
derstand the application of it, when it comes
to be examined hereafter, on both sides.

The original examination of Broomhead
was finished by reading these papers; he was
then cross-examined; he said there was a
hand-bill circulated for the purpose, as he
supposed, of exciting the people against the
society; it was a call to the people to arm
against foreign and domestic enemies; that
the adverse party to him, aud his friends, at
Sheffield, had given out, that they should be
able to do nothing with him, nor his party,
the society, till they could cause a riot; that,
from this, he understood, that arms came to
be talked of; that it was to oppose illegal
force, such as had been used at Birmingham,
and at Manchester; such as was against the
law of the land; he says, Gale had, in his
hand, the hand-bill, at the time they were
talking of arms; and there were several re-
solves printed, in his paper, the week follow-
ing, being a direct answer to it, mentioning
something upon the matter.

Being asked, if any of the people in this
society to which he belonged, bad any idea of
making any attack upon the king, or the
House of Lords, or had any idea of altering
the government, in that respect; he says, it
was as much his intention to fly to the sun;
he says, his object was, to enlighten the people;
to show them the ground of all their com-
plaints and sufferings, when a person worked
for twelve hours a day, and could not get a

living ; that was what he understood of it; |

their object was parliamentary reform; as
such they corresponded with the Society of
the Friends of the People, as well as the
Constitutional Society; he says, he would
not have been a member of this society, if
there had been any idea like that of attacking
the King, or the House of Lords; he does not
think there was such a wicked man among
them; that parliamentary reform, in the
House of Commons, was their object; that
the idea was, that King, Lords, and Commons
might, with the concurrence of the nation,
make a reform; that no one, in Sheffield,
doubted but that the object was, to attain this
pereetys and that there was no intent, to

is knowledge, to use any force. Then he
added, what wicked people might have done,
in that case, he could not answer for; he
says, he would not have sent a man there, as
a delegate, if he had supposed he would not
have acted peaceably.

When he was re-examined, he was asked
as to one Ashton, who had been secretary
to their society; he said, they might have
sent, for aught he knew, to the Friends of the
People, to say, that they would have no more


to do with them; and it might have been
discussed in their meeting, whether they
would have any more to do with them, be
cause they were not fit for their purpose.
Gentlemen, you will find, in the course of the
correspondence here, a letter, which bad been
written by this society, after they had correr
ponded with the Society the Friends of the
People, written to the London Correspondi

or Constitutional Society, in which they say,
that they did not care to have any thin
more to do with that society, the Friendsa
the People, not thinking them honest, _

He says, he does not know of a resolutica
being come to, to write that letter; it might
have been after he was gone ; he says he took
some part in the debate, and does not believe
that they, the Society of the Friends of the
People, were honest; that though they bed
promised to use all constitutional means, they
were not satisfied with them; this might be
about the twenty-sixth of May, 1792. After
the hand-bill had been published, he says
they published a counter advertisement, asd
they took the same words in their counter
advertisement, as had been taken in thi
hand-bill, and had it inserted in Gale's
calling upon the people to arm against
invaders, and domestic enemies.

He was asked, as he says they had ben
threatened, whether, before they armed, they
had applied to any magistrate ; he says, na.
He states that Gale and Yorke, two of the
active members of this society, proposed these
papers, and that the society winked at ther
doing it; by which he meant to convey, that
they were more violent than they should have
been; that they winked at their doing it, a
having a good opinion of them, says,
that the resolution respecting landing of He>
sian troops, was passed long before this baad
bill; he knows nothing of the intelligence
that was sent at the time to the London Cor-
responding Society, by Davison, nor beard
any thing of it, till he was informed of it at
his examination before the privy covodl
He says, he cannot answer for every body
was in this society; there wight be wicked
men among all bodies; that as to this
Davison, if he sent the letter, it was without
his knowledge. There were then read
tions of the date of the twenty-first of Marcb,
1794, of the Constitutional Society, and of the
twentieth of March, of the London Cores
ponding Society, returning their thanks for
the lecture, and the proceedings, uj the
Fast-day ; and the witness says, that the
lecture was re-printed in London, in the yeat
1794.

The next witness is Henry Alexander; be
was a member of the London Corresponding
Society, belonging to the division which met
at Robins’s coffee-house, Shire-lane: thst be
was the ninety-fifth member of that division;
he became a member in November, 1195,
Yorke also was a member of that society; he
remembers Yorke being them when the 1000


was quite full; there were between sixty and a
on people; that Yorke took his leave of

: the society by a speech ;:that he talked of
' going to some place, which he called Bel-gs-

um; that he understood him, he was to head
the French army, and that they would be ripe
fur a revolution by Christmas; what was
really said, how this man must have misun-
derstood, we cannot very well guess, but to be
sure it could not have passed exactly as he
understands ; and what he meant by, “ they
would be ripe for a revolution by Christmas ;”
whether he meant, that the ap of the
world, where he was poing, would be ripe for
a revolution, or whether he meant, when he
came home, they would be ripe for a revolu-
tion, does not at all appear, by this man’s evi-

ce, any way that you can depend upon;
but, he adds, that he hoped to come to Lon-
don, at the head of them ; that is, I suppose,
the French; and he talked of having the
honour of being a member of the convention,
in France ; he hoped he should come at their
head, hither; that the society would join
them; that Mr. Pitt’s, the other ministers’,
and the king’s heads, should be upon Temple
Bar; that the king and queen of France had
met with what they deserved; that the Sans
Culotes were a set of brave fellows; and he
hoped, when he came, that the society would
not sbrink from what they pretended to be;
he said, it was impossible to do any thing
without some bloodshed ; he said, that there
were a.set of brave men at Shefiield.

He says, that the night before this conver-
sation , there was a ian at the meet-
ing, who came from Sheffield, who said there
were pikes at Sheffield, at six-pence a piece ;
another man answered, that it would be right
to have some; it would only be living upon
bread and cheese for one day. After this the
witness says, he went and discovered what he
knew to Mr. ‘Dundas, and: the lord mayor,
for he thought it was proper government
should be let into the light of it; he was first
asked to go to their place by a friend of his,
one Smith, a delegate; he was asked to be
made a member; he was there seven times
in all; and this is the whole of his evidence.
You see the substance of it is, he gives an
account of a ve extravagant conversation,
supposed to have been held by this Yorke, at
the meeting ; what you will make of it, is for
you to judge,

Upon his cross-examination, he says he
was a linen draper; he resides now at the
Rose, in the Fleet Market; that it was at the
latter end of the year, 1793, when a friend
asked him to go.with him to one of those
divisions; that Whitehorn said Smith had
asked him; that Smith, Ashley, and Baxter,
were there; that nothing happened to offen
him that night; some papers were read;
Whitehorn bad belonged to a Society in
Holborn, which. the witness did not know till
afterwards; ‘that, for his-part, he never wished
fox a reform in parliament; he said, that he


had read a which. they gave him, to two
or three of his friends; he said, he went the
second time to see what they were upon; that
he had not, at the first time, been desired to
po but that he had been twice after he had

en at Mr. Dundas’s; he says, they all shook
hands with Yorke at parting.

He says, he is not now in employment, and
has not been since May; he hed been a few
months at Mr. Kellerby’s, in Finsbury-square,
who was a linen draper then; he has since
let his shop to another person, and carries on
the tayloring business; he had been before at
Mr. Faulder’s, a linen draper’s, in Holborn,
almost two years; he says, he was lately
engaged with a Mr. Marley, in Holborn; he
left him on Friday last, telling him he was
going out of town; the reason, he says, for’

loing that was, that he thought of going to
Sheffield, and it would not be convenient to
pretend to remain in place, when he could
not stick tu it. He was asked, what passed
the other nights ; he says, he has no parti-
cularremembrance of any thing; but the third
or fourth night he saw Yorke; ie heard Yorke
say, he been to Newgate to see Mr.
Frost; he never heard Yorke mention any
thing about pikes, and he says, he does not ‘
think Yorke was at the meeting the night
that the pikes were talked of.

Gentlemen, if much depended upon the
credit of this witness, there certainly are some
observations that go to his discredit, upon this
cross-examination ; at the same time he is not
contradicted as to the facts which he hassworn,
by any person that comes from the division ;
it is not possible to say, that his evidence is
not to have re; paid to it, having regard to
it, still you will take it with those allowances
that you ought to make for an account of the
sort that this man has given, which is notvery
correct, and not very intelligible, in every part
of it; it does seem, upon the whole, if his evi-
dence is to be depended upon, that Yorke was
at this meeting; that he was then going some-
where, and he talked extravagantly, and of
coming to London to head a revolution, some-
time about Christmas, and hoping the society
would join with him, when he did come;
what is to be the effect of that upon the
whole of the case, you are to judge.

Thomas Whitehorn says, he is shopman to’
a bookseller; he became a member of the
London Corresponding Society the same even-
ing with the last witness; he says, he was
there four times; he saw Yorke there once;
there might be from forty to sixty people;
another says, I think, from sixty to a hundred ;
the room was full; Yorke seemed to be very
well known; he made a very long speech ;
he heard him speaking very loud; what it
was, he could say nothing at all to, but he did
understand something of his going abroad;
he himself had lived with Mr. Owen, in Fleet-
street; afterwards he went to a Mr. Bagster,
in the Strand; he saw Alexander after this,

but that he himself left the society, having”

changed his situation, and it not being con-
venient to him to attend. You see he does
not confirm the last witness, as to any thing
Yorke said, but does confirm him as to the
fact, that he was present when Yorke was

resent, and when he made a speech, and that
fe said he was going abroad.

The next witness is George Widdison; he
is a hair dresser and turner, at Sheffield; he
says he has been a member of the society, at
Sheffield, abuut two years; he saw Yorke
there, at a meeting in Queen-street, not long
after the execution of the king of France; he
saw him at the Castle-bill, in the month of
April; he used to dress his hair. It was the

eneral talk uf the town, at the time the arms
Bras began making, and he made a dozen of
pike shafis for Gale; that Yorke inquired
when they were mace; when he had finished
one, he carried it to Yorke, and asked him, if
it would du; he said, yes; he touk about a
dozen and a half; that Mr. Wilkinson took
them; he understood they were to be used in
their own defence. Yorke used to say, he
wanted universal suffrage, and that the sucicty
were all for that; he says, there was not
much disputing about the mode; that some
weeks before Yorke left Sheffield, he (the
witness) disagreed with him about this uni-
versal suffrage; he told him he thought the
‘plan would not do, that they would carry it
too far; to which Yorke said, “ I have
studied it, and nothing else will do:” he says,
that there it ended; they differed in senti-
ment, and had no more conversation about it
—he said, he expected to be paid for the pike
handles by the people who took them.

Upon his cross-examination, he said—that
he was a friend, in general, to the king—that
the society, in general, were—that he would
Not have continued in the society if he thought
they were not—that the first notion they had
of universal suffrage was taken from the duke
of Richmond's plan, which was read in the
society, and generally approved of—he never
understoud that it was meant to do any thing
by force—that he did not think the people’s
minds were prepared for it (by which 1 under-
stand him tv mean, prepared for the plan)—
be thought at first that it might be done
without tumult or comtuotion, but that he had
changed his mind.

Hie says, he was with the society at the
time of the Scotch Convention, and should
have voted for the delegates, but he happened
not to come in time—he understood that the
convention would petition parliament, and
address the nation—he said that a petition
would come with more force, but he did not
understand that the object of the convention
was, to assume the functions of parliament;
he would not have been a party to it if he had
so understood—he considered himself and the
society as altached to the king, and was of
opinion, that the king’s preservation and the
people’s liberties were inseparable—there was
nothing said of arnss to attack the king and


[1308

overnment—he does not know that he ever

eard arms mentioned in the society—that he
made a pike for himself, which he thougtt
necessary—that there was not a very good un-
derstanding between the two parttes io the
town, and that this precaution was taken
against people who might come without lezaj
authority from the magistrate.

He says, that he had been threatened m
different companies—that the aristocrats, 3
they called thein, said, if there was an invasiva
they would destroy their enemies at home
first, as the French did: to which the wit
ness replied, that he hoped there was not any
such idea; that if there was, they showd
arm themselves in their own defence; aad
therefore they thought it necessary to arm
themselves. He said, that the House of Lords
never made a part of their conversation; he
had no thought of any reformation of that
sort—he says, that Yorke was a man apt
get warm in conversation, he had heard him
speak, but he had noreason to believe that be
was not well-affected to the king—with regard
to Davison’s letter, he knew nothing ot it;
and he admits that he was onc of the membezs
who gave thanks to Mr. Paine. ‘

This is the first witness you have who speaks
of this plan of reform, and what the origin of
it was; and to be sure itis a lesson to men of
high rank and consequence in the community,
and who have situations .in which they may
debate and promulgate their opinions upoa
the political state of the country, how they
cominit them to the press in the way in which
this was committed; the consequence of
which is, that itis in the power of any maa
to disperse them to any extent: by whic&
means they find their way into the hands of
Persons tvo often unequal to the task of
examining and discussing such topics, and
they become by that means the source of
infiuite mischief to the community—and, if
this is the general history of this plan of
reform, that has thus found its way imto the
minds of the lower orders of the peuple, it is,
say, alesson that I think men of rank and
property ought never to forget.

Gentlemen, the next witness was Henry
Hill, a cutler at Shetfield.—He says, he was a
member of this society in the year 1792?—he
says, there was a mecting at the Castle-hill on
the seventh of April, 1794; abuut that time
there was a conversation about providinz
themselves with arms; that Davison, whe
was spoken of, who worked for Gale, aprhed
to him to make pikes; the witness madea
peuera for him, which was approved of; be
had the iron on Davison’s credit, and Davisoa
was to pay him for the making—he saw
Davison atterwards at Camage’s—he sent to
Yorke, but Yorke had just received an account
of Mr. Walker's trialat Manchester, in which
he was much interested; he was very much
overjoyed on that account, and he would not
talk about these pikes—he said, he saw one
after that, which was finished, Yorke bad it ua


his hand, but he did not converse about it, he
was only playing with the children—he says,
he made a hundred and thirty pikes for Davi-
son; he had two-pence apiece for workman-
ship—he says, he saw Davison’s letter; that
Davison said, he did not know but they might
have the same occasion for pikes in London
as they had in Sheftield, if they were attacked
by any unlawful set of men, that they might
defend themselves.

Upon his cross-examination he says, he
would not have been a member if he thought
they intended to oppose the king; he never
heard any declarations of that sort at Shef-
field ; the society always appeared friendly to
the king; for any thing he saw by them he
Tever saw any thing to make him think the
contrary; all they wanted was, a more equal
representation in the Commons House of
Parliament: they followed the duke of Rich-
mond’s plan—there were some pikes prepared,
on account of the opposite party using such
threats ;—that they have come in the dead of
the. mght; they called the place where he
was Jacobin hall, and they called them level-
lers and Jacobins—there were an armed set of
People who paraded the street, and fired into
people’s houses; when going home at twelve
’clock at night, they have shot under a per-
son’s door—he says, that they never intended
to attack the magistrates —he knows nothing
at all of the vote of thanks to Paine.

The next witness, Robert Moody, is a
joiner, who also lives at Sheffield, and wasa
member of this society—He says, they had
district meetings, division meetings ~he knew
Henry Yorke, he was sometimes chairman;
he saw him at the meeting upon the Castle
Hill; he thinks there were not fewer than
ten thousand people assembled ; that the po-
pulace drew Yorke home; that Camage was
there reading some resolutions, which he saw
afterwards in the Sheffield newspaper; that
Broomhead acted as secretary.—The society
consisted in the whole, if all assembled, of
six hundred; and the rest, according to his
account, were the mere populace assembled,
many of them probably could not hear any
thing that passed.

Gentlemen, you see, here is a vote of ten
thousand people obtained in this manner;
and it is a remarkable circumstance, that the
motion for petitioning parliament was con-

certed to be rejected in the meeting of the |

junto before they came there. This gives us
an excellent idea of what a debate in such an
assembly as that must be.

The witness says, that Broomhead was se-
cretary at this meeting—that Camage brought
him four or five pikes, and bespoke. three
dozen of handles; that the blades were
brought afterwards for the whole ; that he did
not inguire what they were for, nor did he
know who they were for; that Camage said
aman of the name of Davison was to take
them from him; that he was to be paid
ready money for them when they were done.


—He remembers a report that they were to
be used against people by whom they "y
posed they might be illegally attacked; for
report, and only report as he knew of, had
said they should be dispersed—They had
met frequently in large meetings, and many
of opposite principles said they should be
dispersed ; and that very likely they might.
get some authority from the justice of the
peace, for that a little might procure that;
and they got these arms to defend themselves
if they should be illegally attacked.—He says,
that there were dragoons in the neighbour-
hood of Sheffield; that he saw a model of a
night-cat; he asked the use of it, carnage
said, it was an instrument to throw int
street to prevent horses travelling, and from
the appearance of it he thought it might have
that effect; he said, he did not recollect that
the man mentioned any town where they had
been used.—He saw a few pikes brought into
Camage’s by another man — that Davison
asked him to let a letter or two be directed to
his house for him, Davison. — :
Upon his cross-examination he says—he
was not a member at the time the delegates
went to Scotland—he never heard that an
night-cats in fact were made, but that this
thing, which seemed to he a model, lay in the
shop open—-he says, he never heard any thing
said against the RIDE? that he himself was a
friend to the king; that he believed the king
to be a good man, and it would be a crime
to do any thing against a good man---that is
a very good idea as far as it goes, but in fact
it is not that description of loyalty to the
prince which the occasion seemed to call for.
He says, there was no talk of pikes till
after the threats had been made use of—he
says, he made two dozen and nine handles,
and Widdison made a few more, and that is
all he knows of; that these were made two
or three weeks before the volunteer company
were raised at Sheffield; and he says, that
their apprehension was, that these pcople
might take upon themselves to disperse the
meeting, without any magistrate being pre-
sent, or sending any legal authority for it.
The next witness is John Edwards, a silver-
smith, a young man, who was a member of
the London Corresponding Society.—He says,
he knew that the prisoner was secretary to
that society, and he received from bim a di-
rection to a man at Sheffield. In the month
of April, 1794, he went to Mr. Hardy, to de-
sire that he would enclose a few lines to a
person at Sheffield who could inform him of
some persons who could forge blades for
ikes; and then Hardy read part ofa letter to
im, and gave him a direction to a person;
that the plan was, to forge blades there for the
people at Shefheld—the witness says—I
spoke to two or three members of the Corres-
ponding Society, and I understood that seve-
ral of tent wished to furnish themselves with
pikes. . * .
He says, that a meeting was to have taken

place on the Friday before the prisoner was
\aken up, at the Parrot, in Green Arbour
Court, in the Old Bailey, where every one
was to lay down his money, and then the
blades were to he sent up from Sheftield, and
each was to pay a shilling.—He says, he be-
longed to the twenty-ninth division; he was
sometimes present at the twenty-second. He
was asked if he knew persons of the name of
Gosling, Hillier, Baxter, and Spence ; he said
yes, that the two last were delegates to some
division: he mentioned the circumstance of
pikes to Baxter, Spence, and Hillier.—-He
understood from some of the members that
there was a place in the Borough where they
might learn the use of the musket; that he
knew two persons of the name of Higgins
and Goodwin who were members of the Con-
stitutional Society; that Goodwin told him
of the place: and that he had heard at his
division something of the association by
Franklow, called the Lambeth Association—
he saw Franklow, in a blue coat and red
collar, with white waistcoat and breeches, at
the dinner at the Globe tavern, on the 20th
of January, 1794.

He says, that the division, number twenty-
two, met at the Three Tuns, Snow Hill, one
evening, there were about sixteen of them, he
‘was one (this was before the anniversary din-
ner); it had been proposed to the members
to meet there to form an association like the
Lambeth Association, but that no person
agreed to it.

He says, he understood that there was a
secret committee, for the management of
some affairs of this society; that this had
been dissolved.—He says, it was suspected
that come person had given information who
it was that had been chosen of this commit-
tee, and that Lynam was the person who was
suspected; and the committee which was
dissolved had power to elect a new one; that
Martin, Thelwall, Baxter, Moore, Hodgson,
or Lovett, were elected the secret committee ;
that they received letters, and every thin
-was left to them what they should do wit!
them, it was kept a secret from the society—
sometimes they read letters at the division.

The witness says, he was some time a dele-
‘gate; he attended the general committee of

lelegates about six times; the delegates re-
turned all the new members; that they had
met dt Compton street, they were removed
afterwards to Beaufort Buildings, to Thel-
wall’s.—The Corrésponding Society deputed
five persons to attend the Constitutional So-
ciety, who pg six persons; afterwards
they met ; that there was a debate about the
wwitness’s age at the general committee of de-
legates, Thelwall and Baxter spoke upon that
debate ; there was a debate, also, about the
medals which were to be presented to the jury
who had acquitted Eaton.

He says he was present at the theeting at
Chalk-farm; that the meeting was to have
been held in Store-street, Tottenham-court-


[isig

road, but they went from thence to Chalk.
farm; the witness had a card, or ticket, fx
his admissien, which he procured from the
committee of the Corresponding Societs,
Compton-street, on the Thursday night pre
ceding the meeting at Chalk- farm; that Mr.
Addington, a justice of the peace, prevented
their meeting in Store-street; he supposes
there were two thousand persons, or upwards,
at Chalk-farm ; a person stoud at the doer to
take the tickets; he tore the tickets in half;
he kept one half, the other half was put in
their hats.—There was a kind of trap-ball
ground they met in, which was connected
with the long room; they found some of the
members of the Corresponding Societs ther ;
he particularly mentioned Moore, Hodgson,
Thelwall, Lovett, and Richter — Lovett was
called to the chair—He does not recollect
whether Mr. Hardy was there or no.—He
says, there were two ladies there he was sr-
quainted with, he went up with them into the
long room, and they were locked in, therefor
he could not see so well—he could give no
report of the proceedings at Chalk-farm—he
dves not recollect ever hearing the proceedings
at Chalk-farm reported to the committee, or
any of the societies, because most of the mem-
bers heard it there. |

He says, he knows Robins’s Coffee-house,
that is where the division number twenty-nive
met; he was formerly a member of that div+
sion.—He says he received about this time of
the meeting at Chalk-farm a paper from
Baxter, about the size of the paper pro-
duced, and he believes it to be the same as
the paper produced.—That paper must be
read.

[See p. 682.]

This is undoubtedly a most infamous ani
detestable paper; what it points at is to
plain to be mistaken; and how it is possibk
it should have happened that a man who pre-
fesses to have an object which he thinks lavud-
able, and other people may agree that be
may think it laudable, should have disgrace?
himself by the publication of such a paper ss
this, is hard to say: but whether it fairly cen-
nects with the subject of the present Indict-
ment, soas fairly to heinterwoven into the cun-
spiracy with which this pri8oner is charged,
is another consideration, which you will weg":
fully,and give it that weight which it deserves,
and not give it more, enormous and scae-
dalous as it is, and deserving every punish-
ment which the law can inflict.-—The witness
says, he thinks he received it in October o
November; if so, probably what he received
was not dated the 1st of April, as this paper
is, hut was dated the 30th of January; thst
date agrees with the subject you see, and 5
not unlikely to have been the real date of
this paper; whether he is correct im saying
he received it in the month of October or Ne
vember will depend upon his recollectioa.

He says, that from Chalk-farm they west

: -to Conspton-street, where his division used to
meet; they supped, and staid there till eleven
o'clock; Thelwall was there.—He says, that
there was a meeting upon the 2d of May,
1794, at the Crown and Archer-tavern, at
which he was present, having a ticket given
him by Mr. Joyce for the anniversary dinner;
that the address from the Globe-tavern was
read before dinner at that meeting, and dis-
tributett afterwards; the paper which he
spoke of, he received at the Three Tuns on
‘Snow-hill, which was after the 20th of Ja-
nuary: therefore, I apport that paper was
the address from the Globe-tavern, according
‘to his former evidence.~-he says, he has been

. at Thelwall’s lectures—that a a of pikes
was to bea shilling for each blade. d

He was asked as to Gosling and Hillier—
he says, he knows them; they came to his

. father’s house on the Monday, he mentioned

. ‘before there having been a meeting appointed
in Green Arbour-court, to lay down money
for the pikes ;_ the meeting was postponed to
the following Friday.-While Costing and
Hillier were with him they heard that Hardy
was apprehended (that accounts for their not
having the pikes); he did understand they
meant to have attended the meeting on the
Friday—that fir was recommended for shafts
to these pikes—he had a pike made himself:

_ be destroyed the blade upon the Wednesday
after he heard Hardy was in custody, being

' afraid it should be found. He was asked if
he had a magic lanthorn? he said he had
one—that it had nothing but the destruction
-of the Bastile and the beheading the governor

‘ painted on it.—He says he knows Hillier;

* that he had a pike, but not of the same con-
struction as his.

' Upon his cross-examination he says, he
became a member of the Corresponding So-

: peg July was twelve month; that he

5 lea pike for himself in March, 1794—he

' says he heard Yorke at Robins's Coffee-house

* say, that they had pikes at Sheffield; and he
says, he understood that severat members had

: furnished themselves with arms—he says, it

i was just about the time the Hessian troops

: had been landed without the consent of par-
liament; but he says, he had no intention to

‘ use these arms against the government of the

: country—he meant to get pikes for some who

: might want them for the same purpose as, he
: says, he did, to defend himself in case there
should be any illegal dispersions of the meet-
| ings, not against any legal power, but only
against illegal attacks upon them; that a
great deal of opposition had been shown to
their meetings when they proposed to asso-
Clate.

He says, Hardy was always very quiet in
the division; he never used any improper
expressions; that Hardy made no proposi-
tions for arms or pikes; that he told Hardy,
he had made a pike. He says that Baxter
gave that bill, La Guillotine, to two or three
persons; and he, wishing for one, got that


i


which he produced ; he says, he does not know
that Har. fascial that; he does not think
he would have approved of it; the first bill
was of another edition. He understood Har-
dy knew who the persuns were to whom he
was to send for pikes; he says that the pikes
were made at the time the Hessian troops
were landed. He had notice that there were
some spirited Resolutions by the Sheffield
Society; he learnt it from a bouk he pur-
ch at Eaton’s shop.—He says that his
society met without the use of any weapons
for two years previous to that time; but he
heard that a division in Bunhill-row had been
often interrupted by the police officers.

Now, the material fact upon this young
man’s evidence with regard to the prisoner, is,
that it adduces pretty strong provt that the
letter had been received by Hardy from Davi-
son, and that he had, in some sort, acted upon
it; whether he had proposed it publicly at the
division, or no, yet that he had such a letter,
and could tell them where those pikes were to
be got; in consequence of that, he madean ap-
plication to Hardy; and in consequence of
that applicatiun, there was to have been a
meeting at the Parrot in Green Arbour court,
where as many as chose to have pikes were
to pay the money; which certainly connects
Hardy with these pikes, so far as that transac-
tion goes.

The neat witness is Samuel Williams;—he
says, he is a gun engraver; that he was a
member of the Londun Corresponding Society;
he knew Franklow; he saw hinyin his own
house ; he was also a member of the Corres-
ponding Society; that Franklow had applied
to him to make some arms tor him; he saw
the feast advertised, and went to Hardy fora
ticket ; Hardy said, it was not usual to give
tickets to those who were not me.nbers ; he

ave him one of the addresses, and said,
it was for a reform in parliament. The
witness says, he gave Hardy an order forsome
shoes, which Hardy made; and then he told
Hardy, he was in a line for selling guns;
Hardy desired him the next time he came, to
bring a gun with him; he broaght him one;
Hardy sold it, he then gave Hardy «n order for
a pair of boots; Hardy bid him bring two
or three guns, which he sold likewise; and
one gun was in the house, which was not
sold, when the prisoner was apprehended.

He says, he Draws Spence, of Little Turn-
stile; he had seen Franklow there; he went
to Spence’s to instruct persons in the manuat
exercise, at the request of Mr. Frankluw; that
they exercised in a one or two pair of stairs
room, between eight and ten in the evening;
and he thinks that the curtains of the room
were down; they used to mcet on Thursday
night. He says, he became a member by
Mr. Hardy’s recommendation, ahout a fort-
night or three weeks after his first seeing
him, He says, he knew a society called the
Loyal Lambeth Association ; that was the as-
sociation to which these people belonged ;

conversation; it seems to end im nothing;
and I do not think you can connect it so as ®
make any thing out of it; therefore I do ont
mean to state it as a circumstance upon whxb
you can raise any thing.

The next witness is George Sanderson, who
says that he was at Shelmerdine’s, in the Bo-
rough, upon the second of April; he says, be
went there to decide a bet; that he saw there,
about seven or eight stand of arms, and some
men exercising, who belonged to an armed so-
ciety; that they were members of the Londua
Corresponding Society ; that their numbers
were about twenly-six or twenty-seven; be
says he might have seen about twenty-icur
or twenty-five together at Shelmerdine’s; he
says they objected to him because he was not
amember of the London Corresponding Se
ciety, but they admitted him upon his pro-
mising to become a member ; he understood
that they were to obtain a reform of pariz-
ment at the point of the bayonet ; be does not
mention who said that, nor what the particular
expressions of the conyersation were from
which he collects that, but that he collected
it from their general conversation.

He says that they adjourned to the house
of one Day, in Worcester-street, where there
was a private committee, who had settled
certain places where they were to assemble,
he says that one of the meetings was at
Spence’s, another at a shed in Westminster,
near Tothill Fields Bridewell; he attended

sometimes in Westminster, from the eleventh
of April to about the first of May ; they were

fe say8 that Shelmerdine was a hatter, that
he frequently changed his men; and be end
one reqson for removing from Shelmerdine’s,

alarmed with apprehensions of an invasion
and civil commotion; that therefore they
Meant to associate ; that part of them met at
the Borough; that a condition of the asso-
ciation was. not to go beyond the parish of
Lambeth ; that they proposed to divide into
ten divisions. He says their conversatiqn was
about a parliamentary reform ; but, from con-
Versation with Franklaw, he understood, that,
if they did not get a reform in parliament, they
would have it ly force of arms; that none but
members of the London Corresponding So-
ciety attended this Lambeth Association.

You sce, this man speaks of guns, which
he supplied to Hardy and to Franklow, for
this Lambeth Association ; with regard to
what he supplied to Hardy, I think you can
hardly raise much implication from that upon
Hardy; it isa mutual concern in trade; this
man begun it by buying shvues of Mardy ; and
he intimated to Hardy that he was in the
gun line; in consequence of which, Hardy
gave him an order, and he gave Hardy ano-
ther order; and then Hardy gave him ano-
ther order, and he disposed of muskets for
him, which he might do, for all that I see
from that part of the case, very innocently ;
Lut it has somewhat of a different complexion
with respect to Franklow’s Association ; for,
if any thing is to be objected to that associa-
tion, there Is something to object to Hardy,
for having given this man a card to Franklow,
gad mentioning his association.

Now, that this association was to be ob-
jected to, is evident from the circumstances
of the case; for, you see, this is an associa-
tion carried on in a private and clandestine
manner; they meet in small parties, exer-
cising in a room, ata late hour, the curtains
down, and circumstances of concealment, and
a concealment, very contrary to what might
be expected in the ordinary case of an associa-
tion, where people are proud of their arms,
and of appearing in their uniform ; so that
nothing seems to account for their proceeding
in that clandestine manner; therefure the
Lambeth Association seems an assumed name,
and not warranted by the real circumstances


was, that they thought some of his men
might not be staunch to the cause; that was
his expression. » 3

- He says he was one night at a meeting of
the division in Shire-lane, a member men-
tioned a circumstance which was: mot pro-
eeeded upon, and therefore does not seem to
‘amount to much; that Mr. Pitt was to go
over one of the bridges at twelve ofclock at
night; somebody pe) it was very improper
to make any comment upon that, and nothing
more passed upon it; he says there had been
news of a defeat of the British army, which
they of this society treated as good news; he
says that one of them said he had the pleasure
to inform the society that one of the king’s
messengers had been killed in the country ;
another said if it had been his own son
should have been glad; he savs there were
frequent intimations to take care of spies;
that there was a proposition that ten should
meet at one house—that is; nine of them to
meet at the house of the tenth; they talked
of blowing a spy’s brains out. The witness
was asked what he was, if he was not a spy—
he says he was; that they were talking of a
reform of parliament at the point of the
Dayonet ; that that appeared to be the inten-
tion of this armed society from the general
conversation.

Now the circumstance mentioned by this
witness of the manner in which these people
‘were shifting about under the direction of a
Secret Committee, to be exercised in small
numbers at different places, with the observa-
tion that was made in regard to Shelmerdine’s
frequently changing his men, with the appre-
hension that his men might not be staunch
to the cause, certainly warrants very great
suspicion that this armed society was forming
for no good purposes, and that this is, there-
fore, a circumstance which does make part of
atie case which is now under consideration;
{pr it is, [ think, if this evidence be true, im-
possible to suppose that this was a regular
volunteer society, who were only arming
themselves for these ostensible purposes ex-
alti in these articles; they state strange

language to have been used by these people,

you will judge what credit is due to that evi-
dence ; if they did use such language, it shows
that their minds, at least, must have been in
2 state of very creat irritation, and that they
had designs not fit for honest men to enter-
tain, and which must create real apprehen-
sions in the minds of all those who know
that such designs were conceived by such
men.

Edward Gosling, who was also a member
of the Correspwnding Society, says that upon
the fifteenth of Anril, 1794, he was admitted
a member; that Mr. Wickham, a magistrate,
had desired him to he proposed; that he
went to Hillier to inquire after a man he hap-
pened to know that was a member of that
society ; he says what led him to go to Hillier
was, that having seen seditious pamphlets


there, he thought he might be able to leartt
frorh him where this man was; he says
that he concluded ftom the circumstance of
these pamphlets being sold there that he
was a member of the Corresponding Society.
—that led him to inquite of Hiller after thts
tan; he sdys, he was proposed without any
communication with the magistrate; but he
attended afterwards in order to discover whe-
ther they really had atty intention to arm.

He says that the division he belonged to
was number eleven, meeting in Northampton-
street, Clerkenwell, he did not recollect: the
sigh, but the man that kept the house was
named Holt; he says that there was some
conversation about the meeting at Chalk
Farm, which had been on the day before §
that it was said to be necessary to arm for
the purpose of defending the Convention as
they had done in France.

If this was a fact well established, it would
be a very strong faet indeed in the case,
because wheri you once stippose the idea to
be that the Convention was to meet without
arms, to act peaceably and in order, and that
the others were to defend them with arms,
that would give that Convention a complexion
to be sure of a very dangerous nature indeed,
and would go @ great way to warrant every
thing that has been said of it. But you wilt
remember that this very strong fact 1s stated
by a man of Gosling’s description, to whom
some exceptions in point of credit lay, the
weight of which you will weigh in your
minds.

He says that the Convention was to be
called in about six weeks; that they talked
of repelling force by force, if Mr. Dundas
should bring his Scotch laws into England;
that the expression used was, “ The infamous
and ever to be detested Court of Justiciary
in Scotland; he says that there were one or
two hundred thousand copies of the proceeds
ings and resolutions of that day ordered to be
printed.

On the Monday after this, he says he was
at another division mecting at one Mortis’s,
a jack-maker’s, in Brick-lane; that division,
he believes, was called number sixteen and
twenty-five; doctor Hodgson was recom-
mended by the committee to be relieved; he
says that he and Hillier went to see this
doctor Hodgson, who, I take it, was at that
time in Newgate; they found Lloyd, Roussel,
and a captain Williams, an Amcrican, with
Hodgson; there was a conversation with
doctor Hodgson, he asked the witness if he
had seen a copy of the new constitution, by
which this Corresponding Suciety was to be
divided into small divisions to learn the use
of arms at one another’s houses; that it was
almost ready—that they were to be called
tythings —that their object was, to keep spies -
from getting into the society ; their numbers’
were tncreasing, and they would soon be
irresistible. The witness observed that there
were ne mén of property among them, to

which Roussel made this reply, that as soon
as they were organized, money should not be
wanting. That will also be a very strong cir-
cumstance in the case, if you should be of
opinion that this witness is deserving of
credit. He says that Lloyd gave a toast—
“ The world a republic or a desart.” Doctor
Hodgson said he hoped soon to see a Revolu-
tionary Tribunal established in this country, for
he hated all others; Roussel said he was going
fram thence to Thelwall’s, and he should set
off next day. Hillier asked if he was going
to France, he said, yes.

The witness says he was that evening at the
division he belonged to, the eleventh division,
that one Wright, a delegate, was there; that
when he was coming away, Wright asked
him if he had got any arms? he said no;
Wright told him it would be necessary that
all should have arms, as possibly we might
very soon be compelled to use them ; he says
Gordon was their secretary, that Gordon said
he was going to America, that he was very
sorry to Teave the society just as they were
going to act as well as tu think, and to rege-
Derate their country; that he should take
some copies of their spirited resolutions to be
delivered to the popular societies in America,
Hillier mentioned his not having got a mus-
ket, but he said he had got a pike.

He says on the twenty fifth of April he
was at Hillier's house, number eighty or
eighty-one, in Bishopsgate street; that there
‘was a person there whose name he was told
was Wicksly, and there was a drunken man
there, and a man of the name of Bennet;
Wicksly said he had received a letter from
Shetheld, stating that there had been a nume-
rous meeting there, and that they had deter-
mined to petition no more fura parliamentary
reform ; that there were some knives making
of a particular construction at Sheffield; that
the letier contained a drawing of the knives,
that they were to be fixed to poles, and they
talked of their use being to cut the reins of
the horses; that the principal dependance of
the society consisted in securing the royal
family and both houses of parliament. Hil-
lier said if they could resist the first shock
from the army, there would be no danger
afterwards: the king being secured, the army
would have no head to look up to, and would
be gine to accept the additional vay that
would be offered them; that men would not
fight for six pence a day if they could have a
larger sum; he says that nobudy objected to
all this. He says when he was going away,
Bennet went out with him into the street;
that his conversation was so violent, and he
spoke su luud, that he the witness checked
him, for that persons walking by would take
Dotice of what he said.

He says he knows Baxter, that on the ninth
af May he had a material conversation with
Baxter at Hillier’s house; he says Baxter
stated that he had been with Mr. Joyce, who
was secretary to earl Stanhope; that Baxter,


; why do not you blow them all up

(1320

Bennet, and Hillier were at Hillier’s, and some
other persons at a part of this conversation;
Baxter said there was no danger to be appre-
hended for Stone, that is the appre-
hended for high treason, for he too much
firmness to let them get any thas out of
him: he said that the mittee of Corres-
pondence and Co-operation were preparing
an address to the army, with some fe
solutions, and he said that prudent and dete.
mined men were wanted to 2 the
opinions contained in those resolutions; be
said that one Moore had been
active and successful in getting over the
army; that they had most to fear from the
young recruits, they had succeeded best with
the old soldiers; that if one-third of the army
were got over, the others would not do mach.
Then the fact was mentioned of Baxter's hav.
ing an interview with some officers; that
Baxter said one of the officers said to him,
together.
He says, that Baxter asked him if he knew
who would buy a pike, the witness said, he
should have no objection to purchase cee,
but it would be of no service unless he knew
how to use it; he says. Baxter said, if be
would go the Thursday or Friday following,
to the Parrot in Green Arbour Court, in tbe
Old Bailey, and ask for one Edwards, be

; would be called out to him, that he was to

tell Edwards that Baxter had sent him, thea
he was to have a pike, and that he would be
introduced to others with whom he might
learn the use of them, that Edwards was a
very clever fellow, and could teach him, that
pikes were much cheaper than muskets, that
muskets could not be supplied on account ef
their expense —and that people might do
mischief if they did not know how to use

‘ them. .

‘The witness says, he observed they might
have a parliamentary reform without coming
to blows, upon which Baxter said; ‘* Is there
a man in the society, that believes a parlia-
mentary reform is all we want? No, not one”
—he said that many men of property bad hi-
therto kept back on account of the sanguinary
conduct of the French, but that they were
now willing to come forward, as they were
convinced a revolution might be effected ina
few hours—that he, Baxter, did not wish the
king or any of his family to lose their own
lives, he thought they might go to Hanover,
but that it must be expected that some blood
must be shed, for some poreuler persons bad
offered such insults to the people that human
nature could not overlook.

He says the conversation afterwards turned
upon Thelwall’s having been indicted, in
which there was nothing very material —He
said he attended most to Baxter’s conversa-
tion, because he was informed he was one of
the Committee of Correspondence and Co-
operation. Baxter said many thousand pikes
were making at Sheffield, that the heads were
only to come from thence, and that they were

*- to be stecked in town; -he recommended that
? pothing of that should be mentioned at any
*. of the divisions, till the new constitution
>» should be adopted, for there were spies in the
- society; that it would be adviseable to let the
: French prisoners out, if the emigrants resisted,
* that the emigrants should share the fate of
» the Swiss at Paris. He mentioned the names
: of Mr. Pitt, Mr. Dundas, Mr. Reeves, and
<. other persons who had offered such insults
nto the poorle that human nature could not
- everluok.
He says, in going home with Baxter, he
oe tood from. conversation he had with
« him, that the address to the army, was to set
~ the troops and the emigrants, to be embodied,
-. at variance, and they were to say to the army,
that they had sworn to fight for the king and
; country, and if they were at variance, the
+: might choose which side they pleased; that it
, would be proper to enlarge upon the severity
.- of their usage, and the smallness of their pay,
. ba they must first sound their principles, and
. if they found the soldiers were Aristocrats,
. thea they must not go on. He saysthat with
. Tespect to all these circumstances, he com-
_ Municated them from time to time to Mr.
_ Wickham, that be gave him intelligence of

woat .
ro On his cross-examination, he is asked what
“ situation he was in, he said he kept a broker’s
shop—he is asked if he did not deal in king’s
; Stores, he said he did say to a man to whom
he was unwilling to give his name, that he
: dealt in naval stores, thinking that would
put the man off from any farther inquiry—he
_ says that he is employed by a magistrate, in
. Worship-street, which occasioned him to say
. that—he denies that he lived by smuggling,
, and cheating the king io his stores.
"He was asked if he ever went by the name
_ Of Douglas; he says he did for six years,
while he carried on the business of a hair-
’ dresser, which is ten years since, in Petty
France, at No. 3. He says his father |
hada shop of business in the city, that he |
wisbed to go out for improvement, and did '
notlike to appear as a journeyman, when his |
’ father kept four or five men in his own
house ; that his taking the name of Douglas, |
was a mere accidental circumstance.

He was asked if he knowsa Mr. Lincoln,
whocollects rents for Mr. Macnamara; he says |
he does, and that he borrowed from Mr, Lin-
cola, four or five years ago, ten pound, or
ten guineas, and gave him a note for it, in
the name of Douglas, while he bore that
name, which has been since paid. He says
Mr. Macnamara caine to him to the coffee-
house, where he and the other witnesses
were; that he behaved so ill to him, that he
was much flurried, and did not know what he
said; that Mr. Macnainara came to the coffee-
house to him, and said that the note would
appear against him if it was not paid.

He was asked whether he not by in-
flammatory expressions, excited these people


to say the things which he had stated—he
says that he may have appeared to have ap-
proved of what was doing, but he never did
approve of it — particularly that he never
said, “ why don’t the society learn the use of
arms.”

He is then asked as to a Mrs. Coleman,
who had lived with him, and died in his
house; he says he made her will, and that -
no partofher property was left to her relations
—he is asked if a brother of a former husband
had not made some charge agaiust him—~he
says he never heard any complaint, or an
charge against his conduct respecting the will,
but that a brother had come up to make a
claim. He is asked if he knows one Cox,
cheesemonger—he says hehas dealt with him,
and he did not use him very well, but nothing
turns upon that, for he is not called. '

Then there was a print produced, which
was found upon Roussel, it is an engraving
of the manual exercise of soldiers, with caps
upon their heads, intended to be painted red
—you understand that it is the cap of libert
now worn in France, and is a sort of signal,
by which men who entertain these opinions
may be known.

Gentlemen, I stated to you before, that this
witness has given very important evidence,
tending to show the determined purpose of
this Convention to use force against the king,
his family, and the government—If this man’s
evidence can be depended upon, he certainly
states Baxter to use very strong language, so
indiscreet, that one could hardly have thought
that a man would have ventured to use—and
on the other band, the observation made
upon this, is certainly founded, that this man
is not contradicted with regard to the testi-
mony that he gives, and that all they rely
upon to shake his credit, is what turns out
upon his cross-examination—the account he
gives of himself, of bis having told a man
that he dealt in naval stores, for a vile pur-

ose—having borne the name of Douglas—
fering acted about in that sort of way, and
going there for the purpose of firing infor-
mation to government. Gentlemen, it is
your province to judge what degree of credit
you think fit to give to this man’s evidence.

The next witness, is Joha Groves—he is
another man, whose credit is more directly
impeached than Gosling’s has been, who
also speaks materially, it his evidence is true.
He says he was at the Globe tavern, on the
twentieth of January, 1794; he became a
member early in the month of February, he
was desired to become a member, in order to
make a discovery; he says there was a very
large assembly, he believes Mr. Martin was
called to the chair, who read an address, and
Mr. Richter read it over again; he does not
recollect any particular toast which was drank,
but a great many were read; and by a paper
that was printed, he should be able to refresh
his memory—he says in general, the conver-
sation was universal suffrage, and annual par-

liaments+that their object was to enlighten
men’s minds, to embrace opportunities of
instruction, to learn the natural freedom of
ali mankind, that-he heard nothing about
arms. .

He says, he was present at Thelwall’s lec-
ture ; that it was a general abuse of the ad-
ministration, and the branches of the legisla:
ture : he spoke of the king in terms of con-
tempt; he used the word Solomon, ironi-
cally;. he said, that the House of Lords was
an eristocratic branch, which swallowed up
almost all other functions of the government;
that he recommended a convention, in order
to procure annual parliaments and universal
suffrage; and that he recommended a new
modelling of the House of Commons.

. He says, he was at Chalk-farm; Hardy
was there; that Lovett was in the chair; that
there were printed papers dispersed; there
was a letter trom the Corresponding Society
to the Friends of the People, earnestly solicit-
ing the concurrence and assistance of that so-
ciety, in assembling a convention of the
friends of freedom, for the purpose of obtain-
ing, ina legal and constitutional method, a
full and effectual representation ; he says, the
answer was read from the Friends of the Peo-
ple to the Corresponding Society, dated April
the eleventh, 1794, and then their letter; a
number of resolutions were put, and two hun-
dred thousand copies ordered to be published.

Groves says, he went to a house in Store-
street, Tottenham Court Road, where the
meeting was to be held; he went part of the
way with Thelwall; he says there was a writ-
ten paper upon the dour of the house, in
Store-strect, stating that the mecting was to
be held at Chalk-farm; he says, Lovett was
in the chair; the principal persons who spoke
and acted at that mecting, were Lovett, Rich-
ter, Thelwall, and Hodgson; that Thelwall
made two or three speeches; he says, there
was aclamour went round that there were
spies and informers there; Mr. Thelwall
said, he was for admitting all spies and in-
formers there, because the number of the
members of the London Corresponding So-
ciety could be no agreeable news to the mi-
nister ; he says Richter read the resolutions ;
that Richter stopt reading to make some ob-
servation of his own; upon which Hardy
said “ read, sir, without comment ;” this was
when Richter was reading the address.

The witness says, he returned to the divi-
sion room, in Compton-street ; that ‘Thelwall
was in the chair; that Thelwall, taking a pot
of porter in his hand, he blew off the head of
the porter, and said, this is the way I would
have all kings served, or this is the way I
would serve all kings. Being asked, if an
particular toast was given, he says that Thel-
wall gave—The lantern, or Jamp-iron at the
end of Parliament-street; he called for some
one to cover it; to give another toast I sup-
pose ; and somebody cried out,—The ‘trea-
sury-bench; he thinks there was mo visitor


there, at this time; ‘he says, that Green was
a member, and that he liad a private conver-
sation with hia in the coffee-room ; that be
talked of annual parliaments and universal
suffrage ; but he said, these were only to be
considered as ladders to obtain their ends.

He says, there was a kind of shed at Chalk-
farm, in which they were eating bread and
cheese, and drinking porter; that séveral
people there pulled out a cutting instrumest,
corresponding with each other; a sort of
French knife, which when the elasp was
opened, iLprevene its joint working, so that
it was fixed straight forward ; that Pearce had
one; somebody said, they were bread end
cheese knives; upon that observation there
was a smile; he says, he looked upon them
as harmless instruments, certainly ; be asked,
where they were to be had; they said he
might have some of Green; he asked, where
Green was to be found; they ‘said, he wass
perfumer and hair-dresser, in Orange-strec,
Leicester- fields.

He says he went to Greent’s for one of these
knives; Green said, he had sold between twe
and three hundred; that Green teld him te
speak very low; the parlour door was oper,
which was adjoining the shep, and he smied,
and said, for my wite is a damned aristocrat:
that he attended the meetings regularly; tht
Pearce, wheh they were at Chalk-farm, sad,
if you strike with them, speaking of these
knives, they wil not fly back, or words to
that purpose; he says a man, from Sheffic’d,
found fault with the construction of these
knives ; he said they might be made better;
that they were not equal to those at Sheikeld.

He says, he was at a mecting, when a sub-
scription was proposed for Dr. Hodeson,
which application was rejected, on the ground
of the violence of his conduct; and there was
another reason, if the witness's memory wz
right, that he was not considered as a mem-
ber; he said he was present at the Crown
and Anchor tavern, upon the second ef
May; that there was a division meetinz in
February, when an address from Stockpert,
was read ; that was division namber two an4
number three, in Compton-street ; this beisz
so late as the fifth of January, 1794, it will
be proper to read that paper.

[See p. 745.]

Gentlemen, the whole of the paper, in point
of general inflammation, is very bad: but &
is the last passage which is materiully con-
nected with the present case, and the date ss
material, the fifth of January 1794.

Jobin Groves went on to say, that the prise-
ner came to his house, in Crown-court, Co
vent-garden, and brought him a ticket for the
dinner, on the second of May, at the Crcwn
and Anchor; he said he paid nothing for it: ®
was the annual dinnér of the Constitetivnal
Society, and there was a eertain number of
the Corresponding ‘Society invited, about
twenty in all + he said there was some news

came, while they were there, of some public
event; he understood it was very bad news ;
that it seemed to give universal satisfaction ;
that there was a song, called “‘lhe Free
Constitution,” delivered out before dinner,
and there was a paper on each plate, but he
does not recollect what it was; he belicves
Mr. Wharton was in the chair; that Mr.
Horne ‘Tooke was. there, and the prisoner
Hardy, was there; that when the company
came into the room, the French popular tunes
were struck up, and encored, and thev played
ulmost the whole of the dinner, the Marsel-
lois march, Ca ira, and the Carmagnol, and
that it was a continual scene of clapping.

He says, that after dinner Mr. Horne Tooke
addressed himself to the company; he pre-
faced his address by an observation, that he
supposed one out of fifty, in the room, might
be considered as a government spy, and to
them in particular he wished to address him-
self; and the witness says, in consequence of
his addressing himself to government spies,
he did attend to what he said; he begged
the company to take netice, that he was not
inebriated, for, having something to say to the
company, he teek oare to refrain trom his
pass and for fear of being mistaken, and

eing taken to be in a state of intoxication,
he begged every body present to take particu-
Jar notice of what he said ; he called the par-
liament a scoundrel sink of corruption; and
the opposition he called a scoundrel sink of
opposition ; that a juaction betwen these two
scoundrel parties was formed, for the purpose of
destroying the rights and liberties of the coun-
try. He spoke about the House of Lords, the
hereditary nobilzy ; he asked if that skip-
jack, naming a particular lord, could be con-
sidered as one of the hereditary nobility; he
said the same of the House of Lords as of the
House of Commons, he said the junto be-
tween the two parties was in order to amuse
or abuse that poor man, the king; he said, that
the junction of partics in the House of
Commons, was in order to abuse and deceive
the people of this country, He says, Mr.
Tooke's speech was received with great ap-
plause ; that there was a song sung, to the
tune of “ God save the king,” but not those
words: he says, that Mr. Horne Tooke sung
an additional verse of the song; he had fur-
got what that was.

Upon his cross-examination, he says he
follows the business of a conveyancer, and
has done so two and twenty years; he is not
an attorney; he was asked, whether he was
a solicitor; he said be did not understand
what was meant by the question; at last he
admitted, that he was a solicitor, in this
Place; a solicitor for prosecutions and pri-
soners; he said, when Thelwall and he con-
versed, that Thelwall rather fixed himsclf upon
him, than he upon Thelwall; he said there
were a number of very respectable gentlemen,
at the Crown and Anchor; that Mr. Tooke
spoke highly of the hereditary nobility of the


country; -he said, they .had lest their weight
in the state, by the introduction of the new
nobility, who had been introduced into the
House of Lords, by means of their conduct ia
the House of Commons; he said he spoke .
highly of the office of the king, in the consti-
tution ; he said, that the new made peers, or
those lately introduced into the House of
Lords, either had combined, or were com~
bining, for the purpose of amusing that poor
man, the king; that the king had lost his
true weight in the constitution, by means of
this corruption; he says the object ofall his
conversation was, that improper people were
brought into the House of Commons, and
that thereby the evil complained of arose.
They then read a song, which was found
at Hardy’s house, in a letter addressed to
Hardy, without date ; that song must be read.

[See p.761.]

Gentlemen, I would observe to you, upon
this song, what perhaps may occur upon some
other parts of the evidence. It was fairly ob-
served, on the part of the prisoner, that there
is a great deal of difference between this sort
of loose paper, found at his house, in the si-
tuation he was in, as secretary to this popu
society, to whom, therefore, all sorts of things
would of course be addressed, which, perhaps,
it would be prudent to destroy ; but every mam
is not, in that respect, quite prudent; that
there isa vast difference between this sort of
thing, and a paper which bad been commus
nicated, and acted upon, and made thereby
the act of the party himself, by his own con
duct upon it; the evidence could not be re-
jected, because the keeping such papers is
some reproach to a prudent man, and affords
some evidence of the improper connexions he
forms, in consequence ot which all these sort
of licentious things come to him.

The next witness is John Thompson, whe
proved the finding a pike at Hillier’s. .

William Camage is then examined again;
he says, that he saw Margarotin the Tolbooth,
at Edinburgh; that he had a spring knife
upon his table; that it was hard to shut, and
hy his description, something like these Shef-
field knives; he says he never saw one at
Sheftield; that this knife lay publicly for him
to get his dinner with; there were six or
seven peuple present; and it was showed te
him as a curious knife. .

George Lynam says he became a member
of the Corresponding Society, in October,
1792, of the division number twelve, at the
sign of the Mansion House, opposite to the
Mansion House; he says he received the
rules of the society, and the address of the
suciety, in March, 1792; having received
these papers he intimated to the master of
the house, that he thought it would be dan-
gerous for him to permit the division to come
to his house; that he, therefore, declined to
let them come to his house; he says the di-
vision adjourned to the Crown in Newgate

‘street, and he was accepted. as a member of
this society, upon the twenty-ninth of Octo-
der; he says he was at the Unicorn, Covent-
rden, at the division number two; that I
take to be Hardy’s division; that there was
@ large meeting; the room was full; there
might he seventy or eighty people there;
Hardy appeared as secretary ; he says Paine’s
Address tu the French nation, was voted to
‘be published, and delivered out to all the di-
visions; that a paper called the Rights and
duties of Man, was to be continued weekly ;
that the delegates had received addresses,
approving of the society’s address to the Na-
tional Convention ; that the delegate of the
division reports to the division what is done
at the committee of delegates.
Tt will be proper here just to observe how
tbat stands.—By the constitution of this so-
ciety it is divided into a great number of sub-
divisions, us many as they have opportunity
‘to make, consisting of not less than thirt
‘members in a sub-division ; each of these di-
visions choose a delegate to represent them in
‘@ general committee of these delegates;
-which general committee of delegates act for
the society at large; and all such matters as
are thought proper to be communicated te
the divisions, are brought back to each divi-
Sion by the delegate of that division, and
communicated there.—That is the way in
which this machine is framed and carried on.
The witness says, upon
October he was at the division, number
‘twelve, at the Crown in Newgate-street, when
the Address to the French Convention was
read, it having been brought forward before
at a committee of delegates. On the second
of November, at the Rainbow, in Fleet street,
there was a meeting of division, number
eleven. There was a report that the society
at Stockport had written to Sheffield, that
they approved of the different meetings.
There was a letter, which was a pretty long
one, in which it was said, that it would be a
god thing to send, as he understood it, the
ndon delegates down to teach the farmers
pl this letter was by the editors of the
heffield paper, intituled the Patriot, and this
was written to the delegates; this is after-
wards produced, and it corresponds with the
witness’s note; it is much fuller than his
note, but as far as his note does go, it corres-
ponds Hstiy much to the paper; only instead
of sending delegates from London to teach
the farmers politics, the proposition was, that
_ the societies should send delegates from their
respective societies into the country in order
to enlighten the minds of the people-—He
says, there were six honorary members of
the London Corresponding Society admitted
to the society at the Crown and Anchor.
. A certificate of Hardy’s election to be a de-
legate was then produced; it was a paper
found in his possession.
Lynam then went on with his evidence :—
he gays, he-was ata meeting upon the twelfth


the thirty-first of

[1928

of November, at the Unicorn, of division

number two; there were very loud plaady

at the reading a letter from Barlow to the az-

vention of See ool says, it was either

Barrére or Barlow; he seems to give buts

blundering account of that, it certainly w=

quite another sort of thing).—lIle says, the

nuniber of the suciety in London was stated

to be six thousand ; it was observed, that the
divisions in Spitalfields were increasing, sad
soon would be equal to all the uther divisions
of the society.—There was a letter from
major Johnson, from Edinburgh, disapprov-
iegat the address to the Convention sw son
—he says, that the address which they had

ordered to be sent to the Nationa! Conventsa
in France, had been ordered to be published
in France, and sent to the eighty three de-
partments in France.—The society at Shef
field had sent up their address to the com
mittee of delegates, who had forwarded it
the National Convention of France. The
next meeting was on the twenty-first of No-
vember, of the division number twelve, at the
Crown, in Newgate-street; there was a talk
of a congress to be held in Scotland—A
charge, which had been delivered by Mr.
Justice Ashhurst to the grand jury, was read.
—It was reported that the society at Nor-
wich wanted to know if they meant to come
into the duke of Richmond’s plan, or to np
up monarchy; they suspected this was to
draw them into some unguarded expressions,
and declined answering.

Gentlemen, you recollect, that letter was
read, and that when they did answer it, the
answer was more guarded than some of the
letters of the society ; it was. such an answer
as might naturally lead one to think that
there was some suspicion ; it is a curious ai-
cumstance, that in the notes of this man, who
attended the divisions regularly, and took
notes as being a delegate, it should be noted
that they suspected that letter from Norwich
did not come from a friend, and that it was
meant to draw them into some scrape.

He then speaks of the branching of of s
new division, number twenty-three, from
number twelve; and this new division met
at the Ship, in Moorfields, on the tweaty-se-
venth of November—he says, he was chosen
a delegate of this new division he was recom-
mended by his division; and it was pees
at that time that the public should be it
ed that they were not levellers, and that they
wished to avoid all riots and all resistence:
that this arose from the magistrates having
interfered with their meeting—that the con-
versation was, that the first cnaracters at
Edinburgh belonged to the cause, had
themselves into a society, and called them
selves a Convention of delegates.

Upon the twenty-ninth of November, be
says, he attended a meeting of delegates 2
the Sun, in Windmill-street; there were
twenty-two delegates present.—His notes sre.

that division eleven had received twenty wis'-
s


tors from Islington; that a society was in-
tended to be formed there. The sub-commit-
tee brought forward their answer to the Crown
and Anchor Society, which was referred back,
and another answer was offered, drawn by a
fe of the name of Vaughan, “couusel-

lor Vaughan, who was a visitor then from the
Constitutional Society, and this was approved
with some alterations; the words “ dying in
the cause” were struck out; it was directed
to be put in the Sunday’s paper; and that
five hundred bills should be pasted up, ‘that
they were not levellers—and if their funds
were low, Mr. Vaughan said, the Constitu-
tional Society would print for them.—They
understood that enemies were getting into the
society ; that five divisions tal been scouted,
ashe called it (that is, driven from the places
where they met)—that -Margarot proposed to
write to Mr. Pitt and the attorney-general,
that if their meetings were illegal, he would
be ready to surrender himself, but this was
over-ruled; and it was resolved to support all
prosecuted members :—he said, he wrote this
‘minute at the time.

He was then shown a note, which he says,
he received from Hardy; itis in these words
—(addressed, Mr. Lynam, No. 31, Wal-
brooke; dated December the 4th, 1792)—
“Citizen Lynam; you are requested to meet
the Special Committee this evening, at seven
o'clock, at the Nag’s Head, Orange Street,
Leicester Fields. Iam, your fellow citizen,

“THomas Harpy.”

“Please to inform any of the delegates
near you, that you know, but no one else.”

This is a circumstance, in some degree, con-
firmatory of Lynam’s general evideace.—tle
says, he went, but he has no memorandum of
any thing that passed.—On the eleventh of De-
cember lhe was at the division, number twenty-
three ; it was reported there, that the London
Corresponding Societies’ rules had been intro-
duced among thesoldiers.—It wasreported that
the Irish had been scouted as we had | been, and
that they had applied to the council, who had
declared their meetings to be legal; that he
understood by that, the privy council._—He
says, their funds were low, and the divisions
were recommended to subscribe to the publi-
cation of the Address; three of this division
offered to stick the Address up about the town.
~-It was reported, that Baxter, who was a de-
legate of the division, number sixteen, was at
the meeting at Shoreditch church, and that
he opposed that meeting, and that he was laid
hold of; and in consequence of that, seeing
that he could not resist, he threw some of the
Societies’ Addresses among the people assem-
bled there; and he complained he was very
ill-used, his coat torn, and he was struck se-
veral times in the church-yard; he said, it
was a meeting to support the constitution.

Upon the thirteenth of December the dele-
legates inet in Round-court, in the Strand;
cighteen persons were present; Hardy was



one.—It was reported, that the magistrates
were after Littlejohn.—One Field was chosen
assistant secretary. —There was a motion from
the division, number four, that a letter should
be wrote to the Common Council. He says,
that Ridgway was to publish Margarot’s letter
to Mr. Secretary Dundas: the project was,
that this letter was to be written and carried
to the post office hy Margarot and two others.
—The letter was dated the fourth of Decem-
ber, 1792; and that they might be sure it was
sent, they took a receipt from the post office.
The letter to Mr. Secretary Dundas was read,
recommending areform, and to protect them
fom all interruption.—That letter must be
read,

[See p. 771.]

Lynam says, his note goes on to state—
That division, number one, recommends that
it be represented to the public, that confusion
may he expected, but that if riots ensue, our
societies will aid the magistrates, and that
copies shall be sent to the magistrates; but
take care that we say, that no disposition ap-
pears of committing any riot, and that we will
persevere in a parliamentary reform > but if
prosecuted persons were not found to be rash
in words or violence, that it is proper for the
society to protect them—he says, I do not
know whether any thing was done upon that;
there were many things agitated in the com-
mittee.—The delegates of the division, num-
ber two, Hardy’s division, proposed to brin
forward new-shaped cards of admission.—.
letter from Norwich, signed Cosens, was read,
Mentioning meetings being held there, as
well as in other places, to support the go-
vernment; and asked whether the London
Society had signed to support government.—
Margarot proposed, that should not be com-
municated to the divisions: what the reason
for that was, is not clear. There wasa letter,
dated the fifteenth, from Paisley, expressin
their willingness to correspond with us, an
mentioning twelve societies formed in August
for a parliamentary reform. There was a let-
ter from Edinburgh, of the eleventh of De-
cember, to call a convention of all Scotland,
to be of the same opinion, and the title of the
Society was—“ The Friends of the People”—
Archibald East Hodge, president; William
Read, secretary. < .

He says, that division, number thirty-three,
mct at Crown Street, upon the eightcenth of
December; nothing passed there. Upon the
twentieth of December, the delegates met at
number thirty-one, Compton Street; Hardy
was present; two members were deputed
from the Constitutional Whigs to know if the
Corresponding Socicty would concur in an Ad-
dress to the Friends of the People. Division,
number twelve, recommended to petition a
liament before Mr. Grey brings in his bill for
parliamentary reform—Martin recommended
not to publish any thing ; that the times would
not do; that they cculd not stand against the

4Q

treasury. Number sixteen moves for the de-
legates to determine if they should sign the
Address at the Crown and Anchor: and this
was left to every man’s discretion; that is the
address that had been formed there, by ano-
ther party, in support of government; the
question was, whether they should sign that
Address; and this was left to every man’s
discretion, but to avoid it, if possible. Marga-
rot wrote to Cozens, that we will not sign at
any of the meetings.

There is a communication from Norwich,
that five guineas had been sent up, in order
to have Mr. Fox's speech on a parliamentary
reform, sent down to the persons from whom
the money came; and they were to publish
some hand-bills, to express a determination to
persevere. Five hundred copies of Mr. Fox’s
speech were sent accordingly. Division num-
ber sixteen proposed to give tickets to soldiers,
to admit them gratis, if they chose to enter ;
but that they shall be warned of their danger:
this was not agreed to. Division number
twenty-four moved to publish our determina-
tion to support the magistrates, and persevere
ina parliamentary reform: this was agreed
to; and Margarot was desired to draw it up.
A petition trom Carter, who was employed to
stick bills up; that he lost a place of twelve
shillings a week. Martin had been directed
to defend him ; and there was a subscription
to detray the expense. Ridgway had com-
municated, that he was ready to publish any
thing the society chose to send him. It was
observed by Margarot, respecting Mr. Fox,
that he had gone as far as could be expected ;
but that they were not obliged to him; for he
- ‘was forced to avow what he had done. Mar-
tin reported that Gay had employed Carter
to stick up bills; and that he had stuck them
up in the morning, instead of the evening, as
he was directed; in consequence of which, he
was taken up. The next is number thirty-
one, Compton-street, a meeting of the dele-
gaics on the twenty-seventh of December.
The prisoner was there. Each delegate was
to take the sense of his division, on the pro-
priecty of admitting soldiers, aud on what
terms. ’

IIe says, upon the third of January, 1793,
there was a meeting of delegates, at number
thirty-one, Compton-street; Margarot was
chosen president; Hardy, secretary ; Field,
sub-secretary. ‘Lhe distresses of one Thomp-
son’s wife were laid before the meeting; he
was a member, but had gone away to France ;
twelveshillings and sixpence was collected for
her. There was a motioncame forward, for
a declaration to the public; two divisions ob-
jected to it; the declaration was proposed to
be published ; the objection was, because the
declaration said, rather have a constitution
without a king, than a king without a constitu-
tion: it was observed, that this would be a
thing proper to be said, if they were republi-
cans. Margarot reported that he had received
a letter. Notice was given of five delegates


from the Roman Catholics in Ireland, who
were of the same mind with themselves; and
the application was to them, to see whethera
communication could be opened with them
Hardy was present. ;

The next is a meeting at the division num-
ber twenty-three, January the eighth, m
Crown-street, Moorfields. He says, I have
got down here, that the declaration—I° sy
pose the declaration mentioned before—it s
the opinion of this division, that it should be
rejected ; it was agreed likewise, not to ad-
dress the king at all. It was said, Mr. Grey
would not bring forward his motion fora re-
form, unless petitions were sent to parliament;
agreed to petition parliament by all means,
and not to address them.

‘The nextis a meeting on the tenth of Ja-
nuary, 1793, at number thirty-one, Old-Comp-
ton-street ; seventeen delegates attended, of
whom Hardy was one; the declaration was
ordered to lie upon the table ; then it was
agreed upon, that no written paper be brought
in, but by a delegate, or throug the treasurer
or secretary. Margarotreported, that the cous
try correspondence did not shine ; there were
very few letters; he reported that he had
sent a letter to the Friends of the People, at
Free Masons’ tavern: the answer was read;
that they expected to obtain an effectual re
form ; they were desired not to mix fore’
politics with home politics, and to avoid fo-
reign correspondence. It was remarked, that
this society, that is, the socicty at Free Ma-
sons’ tavern, never brought forward their prin
ciples ; and it was determined not to corres-
pond with them. Bell observed, that the ad-
dress to the National Convention of France,
proves that we mean their laws here; to
which, according to this minute, Margarot
said, no doubt; others said nothing.

That, you see, is the most material of all
these papers I have hitherto read to vou;
that, in the course of the conversation at this
meeting of delegates, respecting their address
to the National Convention of France, Bell
said, it proved that they meant the French
laws should be established here ; to which
Margarot said, no doubt; the others said no-
thing; Hardy was then present.

He says, it was observed, that a plau which
had been proposed, of the addition of a hun-
dred members to the House of Commons, will
not do; it will give them more advan!
and keep us from a proper reform. It was re-
ported that one of the Irish delegates had
agreed to correspond. Ata meeting on the
14th of January, at Hardy's, Hardy said, he
had dispersed fifty of our addresses, and
twelve of Keirsant’s speech.

The nextis a meeting of delegates, on the
17th of January, at number thirty-one, Comp-
ton-street. It was reported that nineteen of
the divisions were kept up. It was
that they were to debate, and consider whether
the age of eighteen, or twenty-one, was the
proper age for voting for a member of parlia-

ment: it was argued, it should be eighteen,
because, at that age, they are liable to be
militia-men. Division number twelve re-
commended to consider of a public meeting,
to discuss parliamentary reform ; that was re-
ferred back again, for further consideration.
Number four proposed thanks to the mayor of
Glasgow, and to the society of Durham and
Dundee, for uniting with the society. . There
were sixteen delegates present. A petition
from Carter was presented, who had reccived
sentence for sticking up a bill, supposed to be
a libel. A special committee appointed to
examine how his defence had been conducted.
A motion was made for all the delegates to
meet on a Saturday evening, to discuss politi-
cal subjects. A letter was received from Nor-
wich; the Friends of the People want to pro-
pose a mild reformation ; and this society of
Norwich want to know whether they are
friends. One Hobhouse had formed a society
at Bath, and proposed a correspondence. Then
it was proposed to correspond with the Nor-
wich Society, through the means of the Bell
Society.

He says, on January the 24th, there was a
meetingat number thirty-one, in Compton-
street. Two gentlemen came with a petition
from Thompson's wite. Martin thought it
should be rejected. There was a conversation
about the defence of the bill-sticker, and also
an account of what counsel had been applied
to, and who did undertake the defence ; there
was an anxiety about the manuscript of this
bill which had been stuck up, which had got
into the hand of Grant. A letter from
Richter, that he did not dare attend. The
delegate number five is going to France, with
some copics of Paine’s works; he had private
notice that they would all be taken up.

Upon the 31st of January, Baxter, the de-
Jegate from number sixteen, proposed that, in
future, of the quarterage money six-pence
should go to the society, and the other seven-
pence to go towards the expense of the room ;
at was agreed that this might be a very proper
measure to be adopted for the poor divisions,
but not for the rest. It was remarked, and
assented to by all, that, supposing there should
be an opposition, and the two parties should
come to an open rupture, it would be proper
to encourage the two divisions, number six-
teen, and number twenty-five, in Spital-fields,
because they were very numerous, and it is
necessary to keep them together. ‘hese are
the divisions before mentioned to be as large
as all the other divisions put together. This
last remark, he says, he makes from his re-
collection. Number seven proposed to pub-
lish a letter, which had been written by a
Mr. Law to Mr. Reeves respecting the busi-
ness of an association ; but this was rejected;
and another publication was proposed. The
reply to the answer of the Friends of the
People, objects that they were not explicit ;
and they want to know how far they mean to
go with their design ; and Lynam’s note is,


that they were apprehensive of a breach. The
general sense of the Friends of the People
did not go as faras the London Corresponding
Society, or Constitutional Society, who thought
that it must come to a struggle : this, he said
also was recollection. Margarot said, they
were getting on fast again ; a petition is not
the mode. Then comes a material passage
—but yet, it was agreed a petition should be
presented, to keep the public mind ayitated
upon the subject of reform.

He says, upon the fitth of February, the di-
vision number twenty-three, met in Crown-
street. It was reported, there were sixty
friends to the cause, who declined, at present,
meeting the society; but they are ood
friends, and wish them success; that there
were certain religious socicties in the king-
dom, whose sentiments led strictly to repub-
licanism ; they were numerous in several of
the great towns; naming them; and particu-
larly in London: and that the societies in
London were just now beginning to organize
themselves agreeably to the principles in
France, and that they were to meet on Mon-
days and Thursdays. It was said that Paine’s
works had been published in Sweden.

The next meeting wason the 7th of Fe-
bruary, of the delegates, at number eight,
Queen-street, Seven Dials. ‘The prisoner,
Hardy, wasthere. ‘They were anxious to pre-
serve the divisions, sixteen, and twenty-five,
as poor divisions; these were Baxter's divi-
sions; that they would be of great service, if
we should go to war; this was an observation
of Margarot’s. Many said, it was eventually
expected that there would bea rising in
the country. A letter, sent to Bath, has been
gone fourteen days, and no answer, though
two letters have a sent. A Sheftield letter,
of the 16th of January, by order of the Con-
stitutional Society, had been conveyed to alk
the societies, reljuesting to know how far
they mean to go; and all were of one opinion
not to petition this year. Hardy was present,
and proposed that there should be a delezate
from each division of the society, to agree
how to proceed. Mr. Fox has observed, in
the House of Commons, that the people have
aright to alter the government when they
please ; the Scotch and the Irish have done
it. The London Corresponding Society were
first formed to send a delegate to all the other
societies, to determine the best way of reform.
The Friends of the People, in the Borough,
still exist, and were determined to communi-
cate with this, and other societies, and in-

uire into their intentions. It was agreed
that a circular letter should be sent to all the
societies in London, to meet, two or three
from each, and come to some determination.
The question to be debated at each division,
What is the best way of proceeding ?—and
that mceting to be advertised. It_ was deter-
mined to write to Sheftield, to inform them,
that we will answer them very shortly, how we
mean to proceed. ‘

Upon the 14th of February, 1793, the
division, number twelve, chose Mr. Godfrey
as a delegate, who was rejected, being lord
George Gordon's attorney. My note is, that
there was another man in the division, con-
nected with lord George Gordon, who was
rejected, To be determined at the next meet-
ing, whether they were to petition parliament;
and the observation is, that it will engage the
public attention for the present. Agreed to
demand a conference with the Constitutional
Society: they are drawing up the state of the
representation, and are going as far as us.
The Friends of the People do not go so far.
The Borough Society dues not go so far.
Holborn Society say, they are for Republica:

-nism. The Aldgate Society is Lroken up;
and most of the members have joined the

Corresponding Society. ‘There were about
six socicties in London to confer with. A
letter sent to the Constitutional Whigs at
Sheflicld, saying, there will be a conference
about this matter, and that they will write to
them. Three questions would be proposed
for consideration—whether to petition the
king—to petition parliament—or to call a
convention. It was remarked that it would
be well to decline coming to any resolution
till the whole nation are agreed. Margarot
says, they should neither petition nor remon-
Strate; it would be unconstitutional. Re-
ported that the Aldgate Society had thanked

Ir. Fox for his speech, saying, that the people
might alter the constitution, without giving
their reasons.

, The next is a meeting of division number
twenty-three, held on the 19th of February,
in Crown-street. The question was agitated,
which was the right age for election, eighteen,
or twenty-one; which was put to the vote.

ame to a determination to petition parlia-
ment.

On the 21st of February, the delegates met
at Compton-street. Godfrey, who had been
Tejected and re-chosen, was rejected again,
but insisted he would not quit the place;
therefore they had no other way of getting rid

_of him, but by adjourning to Charles -street.

On Saturday evening, the 23rd, it was re-
ported that a great number of delegates were
in town from different societies in Scotland,
upon a reform.

_.The Constitutional Society have adjourned
till the 15th of March, to see what Mr. Grey
would do in parliament. Agreed to write to
all the societies, to present a petition to par-
liament ; that their’s was to be prepared im-
mediately; and it was expected they should
have twenty thousand names to this petition.
If this petition was rejected, they would write
to their friends to continue, and then will be
the time for all to unite, and to petition the
king. The Fricnds of the People approve of
Mr. Grey’s remonstrance. Reported that the
bank's refusing to discount would assist the
cause, by creating insolvency. A man pro+
posed to them, to subscribe to a book against

t


(1336

imprisonment for debt; they refused to sub-
scribe; but they agreed they would take ex
tracts from it, that were worth publishing.
There was a letter signed Jeremiah Carter, ar
Curteis, the 15th of February, in answer tos
letter of the first; and there.was an answer to
the Norwich Society, that they think the
Friends of the People are friends to the cause.

On the 28th of February, there was a meet
ing of the delegates, at Mr. Stiff’s, in Pater-
noster Row. Margarot proposed thanks to
Mr. Fox and the minority, and to lord Lav-
derdale, and that this should be advertised in
the newspapers. Letters trom Sheffield, in-
closing their resolutions passed on the 13h
of February, by order of the committee.
The witness gives Extracts of the letter;
agreed to write to the Shetiield Society, that a
petition to parliament, though it wun't suc
ceed, at this time it will answer a gacd par-
pose. The London Corresponding Suciety are
going to petition, and write to all the societies
m this kingdom, to do so; it will cance the
subject to be agitated every weck; nu time w
be lost ; and say, we equally lament the war;
Gerrald proposes a petition from the London
Corresponding Society to be sent by Margarot
to Mr. Fox to be presented.

On the 7th of March fourteen delegates
met, Hardy was there; a petition to parla
ment produced, read, and referred to the div
sions; on the 28th of March new delegates
are to be chosen ; Mr. Freind’s pamphlet ea
the war to be reprinted, and each division to
have one; a petition to be drawn out on ralls
of parchment, each delegate to have one, and
to try what coffee-houses will take it ia to lie
to receive signatures. Upon the @tst of
March, Baxter reported that there had been
constables at his division ; a letter dated the
15th of March, from the Birmingham Society
to Hardy, of which he gives extracts beginnin
Citizen Hardy; reported that the Friends
the People had received two letters from the
Friends of Freedom; Grant and Littlejohn
were dismissed from their situation as hono-,
rary members of the Constitutional Scciety~
that society wrote to this society for other
honorary members; Grant was discharged
because he refused to give up the manuscnpt,
Margarot made a motion to print a thousand
of Freind’s address to Republicans and Ant
Republicans, to make extracts and strong
remarks by Margarot. Upon the 28th of
March there were seven hundred and eighteea
signatures, and five skins are not yet brought
in; a select committee chosen to make new
laws and to form divisions; a select committee
to consider of future regulations for the suciet:
at large, and for the constitution of gene:

rinciples. On the 11th of April two thousand
nad signed this petition; wrote to the Friends
of the People, thanking them for their ia
partial state of the representation ; small bills
were to be stuck up in the night, inferming
the people where the petitions hay tor signa-
tures. ‘


On the 29th of April there was the anniver-
sary dinner of the Constitutional Society, at
the Crown and Anchor tavern, lord Sempill in
the chair. The witness says they talked very
Boldly, and laughed at the fears of the public,
and were sure a revolution would take place
in this country. Then come the toasts—the
Rights of Man—may Despotism be trampled
under the hoofs of the Swinish multitude, &c.
- On the 2nd of May, a delegate mecting,
number thirty-one, Compton-street, eleven
delegates present ;—Mr. Fox wrote to Hardy
that the petition which had been brought to
him went toa radical reform, by which would
be understood universal suffrage, which he
was not a friend to, but he would present the
petition if we desired it; they then desired
Mr. Francis to present it; two of the Shettield
delegates that brought their petition were
made honorary members; Mr. Fox’s note was
produced, but nothing turns upon that.

At a meeting on the 16th of May, number
seven proposed to draw up a remonstrance
against the war. It was said Hardy had
received an anonymous letter.

Atameeting on the 23rd of May, twelve
delegates present. It was proposed to call a
pore meeting; there was a letter from

ittlejohn on the 18th of May—proposed to
have a committee to prepare an address—
notice was taken of Le Brun’s letter to lord
Grenville; this might be thought to have
come from some communication with France,
and they waited to see what notice would be
taken of that letter. On the 30th of May,
Hardy moved to break up for three months,
which was not carried.

Upon the 6th of June a public meeting was
advertised five for six; thanks were voted to
Mr. Wharton for his speech—agreed to be
printed, and comments to be made upon it;
Margarot to get a thousand copies of Mr.
Wharton’s speech. ‘The witness says he
ceased to be a delegate from the 15th of June.

He says he attended division twenty-three
on the 25th of September—reported that
there was a new society at Coventry, which
was increasing, and that there was a new
division of the Corresponding Society that
met at the Grove, in Bandy Leg Walk. It
was stated that Cruden, of Walworth, had
written that offensive paper called La Guillo-
tine; it was remarked that he was supposed
to be employed ” the Convention in France.
It was reported that there was a petition to
the king brought forward at the last meeting
of delegates, but it was declared by Mr.
Vaughan to be treasonable; in consequence
of which another was prepared; eighteen
new members were made that week; Bell
was going to Ireland, and would establish a
correspondence there ; a petition was brought
forward azainst the war; Hodgson was chosen
President, and Hardy continued secretary.

_ On the 24th of October there was a meeting
in Hackney-road to elect two delegates to be
sent to the convention in Scotland, Margarot


and Gerrald were elected. On the 5th of Nov.
it was reported that Hodgson had resigned,
and that Baxter was chosen chairman; that
Margarot and Gerrald went to Scotland on the
30th of October ; that the funds were low, the
subscriptions not equal to the expenses; that
another delegate be chosen fom each division,
to form a sub-committee to revise the consti-
tution; report of a new society formed at
Bristol; that colonel Macleod and Sinclair
were gone as delegates to Edinburgh from the
Constitutional Society.

_ Then, gentlemen, you heard of an associa-
tion at Lambeth, to learn the manual exer-
cise; the plan was not matured; these were
members of the Corresponding Society, who
were desirous of learning the exercise. That
memorandum respecting the association at
Lambeth is so far material, that it speaks of
that association as a thing that had been only
then heard of for the first time, and had not
originally proceeded from the committee of
delegates. :

On the 12th of November a division meet.
ing, number twenty-three. Read a letter from
Norwich approving the convention at Edin-
burgh; that the finances are very low, and a
second subscription is wanted to support the
delezates in Scotland. There is a kind of me-
morandum, or sort of instruction for the dele-
gates; a letter is sent to the delegates re-
questing them to visit all the societies in
Scotland. The witness says, that at first he
thought that what was said of the finances re-
lated to the Norwich Society; but lookin;
again he rather thinks that it relates to his
own society; reported that there was to be a
second general meeting to he held at Edin-
burgh, but afterwards it w2s altered and in-
tended to be held at Glasgow: there was a
letter read, dated the 8th of November, from
Hardy to the delegates in Scotland.

On the 2nd of January, the witness attends
again as a delegate; they resolved to remove
the committee room to number three, in New
Compton-street; that no person who had not
belonged three months to the society to be
elected a delegate ; agreed to draw up a hand-
bill approving of the conduct of the delegates
in Scotland, and censuring the justices; to
distribute a thousand in Edinburgh; a letter
was read from Sheffield, signed William
Broomhead, chairman, recommending them
to come to some spirited resolutions to be
adopted for the support of the delegates im-
mediately; it was said that at this meeting
there were about two thousand.

The next meeting is the 9th of January;
he has not got Hardy’s name down at pre-
sent, but believes he was there ; there was to
be a general meeting on the 20th for dinner
at the Globe; a sub-committee was appointed
for the management of this meeting, the
names put down for stewards were, Thelwall,
Franklow, Agar, Kydd, Lovett, Hurrison,
Stiff, Peacock, Harris, Sinclair, Powel, Wil-
liams, Mitchel, Pearce, Moore, Moffatt, Mar«.

tin; those who dined were to pay 5s. 6d., and
those who did not dine only paid 6d. for their
tickets; another sub-committee to be ap-
jointed to write to the societies to unite in an
address to the public on their invaded rights,
by the procecdings of the magistrates at Edin-
burgh, and to discuss the conduct of Mr. Dun-
das; the witness Lynam was reported to be a
spy; he was tricd by the committee of dele-
gates, and acquitted by a great majority.

The witness says he was at the meeting on
the 20th of January at the Globe-tavern, Mar-
tin was president; when they were assembled
the floor gave way; he was there before the
business began; they went to a room above
stairs, there were Martin, Ramsay, Richter,
Thelwall, and Hardy there. The short-hand
writer reported Margarot’s trial; an address
to the nation was carried, and then they ad-
journed to dinner, Thelwall was chairman;
the witness dined in an adjoining room; the
witness came again into the large room soon
after he had dined.

There was a meeting of delegates at num-
ber three, New Compton-street, on the 23rd
of January; the prisoner was there—agreed
that hand-bills be stuck up, saying what
grievances we wish to redress, The next
thing that came forward was a box for the
subscription for the support of the delegates
in Scotland; it was opened that night, the
amount was 13/. 4s. 5d. and nine bad shil-
lings; it was pet to publish the names
of those who had given evidence against the
patriots; this was objected to by Thelwall, as
it might produce massacres. It was proposed
at that time to choose two sub-delegates to
attend the perpetual committee to watch the
parliament every night; this proposal was
Not carried; it was proposed that the com-
mittee should be made perpetual.

Upon the 30th of January, a meeting of
delegates, Hardy being present, division num-
ber eleven recommended to divide the metro-
polis into divisions; number thirteen moved
to recommend it to those who are not mem-
bers to subscribe; number eight wished to
know if they should remove into the Borough,
that press-gangs were about, and they had
lost their business ; Thelwall moved to a
point a permanent committee of delegates to
consider of the measures to be pursued during
the present posture of affairs, and to be a se-
cret one; those of the general committee of
delegates already chosen to be filled up by
other delegates, to be invested with discre-
tionary power to report to the committee
of delegates, but the committee of delegates
have power to dissolve them when they
please; the secret committee were Martin,

axter, Williams, Thelwall, and Moore. This
secret committee were to consider what mea-
sures were to be adopted, and to call a general
committee of delegates when they thought
proper; a sub-committee of three proposed
to consider of raising subscriptions for the
delegates in Scotland, referred to the secret


committee with full powers; Thelwall peo
posed a committee of two as a committee
exigence, to report to the general committee,
but not to publish any thing—but this was
withdrawn ; a letter stated from Bristol from
old friends new revived.

On the 6th of February, at a meeting of
delegates, Hardy being present, a mobca
from the permanent committee to appoint
others who are not to be known. The wit-
ness’s memorandum is, that as it was dan
gerous, they were to be dissolved, 2nd to
name others, and their names not to be men-
tioned.

Gentlemen, this shows you the progres: of
this appointment of a committee; it had zone
to the appointment of a secret committee, to
act in the then posture of affairs; that the
secret committee were afterwards dissolved 9
this extraordinary way, but they were to name
another secret committee, whose names were
Not to be known; so the business was to be
conducted by a secret committee, who mizbt
probably be the same persons, but could uot
be known by any one to be the same persons,
and the ground of it is, thatit was thought to
be dangerous. What the secret committee
were to do is matter of observation upon this
extraordinary proceeding. A letter was re
ceived in a parcel from Sheffield from Mar-
garot, dated the 11th of January, and a letter
was received from Gerrald for a short-hand
writer to be sent down to take his trial.

At a meeting on the 20th of February,
number eighteen moved to reprint the Rights
of Swine; a committee of seven are to revise
the new constitution of the society ; resolved
that 50,000 hand-bills of lord Stanhope’s
speech respecting the foreign troops be priut-
ed, and to return him thanks. After this
time the witness says he ceased to be a dele-
gate. He was then asked who and what be
was; he describes himself to be an ion-
monger, and to be in the commission hne;
that he was first among this society by acci-
dent at the sign of the Mansion House, where
he saw some of the resolutions of the society ;
he told the landlord that this appeared to him
to be a meeting to overturn the constitution,
and advised him not to let them meet there
any more, for if he did that he would have
his licence taken from him. He says he went
into the room and conversed with Watson;
he refers to a paper which the landlord sbow-
ed him which was the resolutions and address
of the society. ,

Upon his cross-examination, he says far-
ther, that he is in the commission line, and
has done business -from Birmingham and
Sheffield; he says he is now epelying ie
business in the East Indialine; he has
seven years in this way in a small d
however he did a great deal of business lat
season; he had a warehouse in Wood-street,
he removed from one house in Wood-street to
another, and from thence to Walbrook, where
he has been ever since; he has not been in

ee

theretail way since he left Alexander Shrimp-
ton and Company; that the resolutions and
addresses were first published upon the twenty-
fourth of May 1792; he says that when he
was tried for being a spy, there was nothing
Particular brought forward against him. In
that month, he says, he went into Stafford-
shire and Yorkshire for some time; that he
consulted with a friend, who recommended to
him to makea reportot these transactions, and
he has done so from time to time; he thinks
the first report he made was on the first of}
October, 1792; he made his reports to one
whom he was certain would communicate
those reports toa proper channel, but that
Rerson was not a magistrate ; he says he put
own every thing he could; that it was his

duty to do so, for he was to report to his own
division, and he gave the same reports to his
division, according to his notes, as he had
given into thatchannel by which he meant to
make a discovery of all that had passed.

Gentlemen, it has been a fatiguing work to
go through these broken accounts of the
transactions of the society from this man’s
Motes, and the accounts must necessarily
be somewhat imperfect; but upon the
whole they carry with them very great
marks of authenticity; and with respect to
those facts which can be clearly collected
from them, they scem to be very weightily
proved, and I cannot imagine that the evi-
dence of this man is shaken in any particular
whatever, from the mere circumstance of a
man, otherwise of credit, choosing to give in-
formation of proceedings which he conceived
to be dangerous to the constitution of the
country ;—to say that thatis to affect his credit,
1s not a thing to be asserted in a court of jus-
tice, nor fit to be encouraged by a jury.
Wherever men of this description give evi-
dence, and they give their evidence ina way
which is fairly open to observation, the cir-
cumstance of their coming to give their evi-
dence in this manner will have its weight, but
if their evidence in other respects is uniformly
consistent and probable, and is not impeached,
it is not cnough to say that this man went inte
this society on purpose to inform the magis-
trate of what was passing. It is extremely
necessary that should be done; it is the duty
of magistrates to watch over the public peace,
if any thing material is going forward by
which the public peace of the country may be
affected; it is the duty of the magistrate to
use all proper means to bring these proceed- |
ings to light, in order that they may be brought
to the test of the law; and he would be
criminal if he did not use those means.

The next witness is Maclean; he produces
a letter found upon Adams, the secretary of
the Constitutional Society, dated the thir-
teenth of October, 1792, from the editor of ;
the Patriot at Sheffield, directed to John An- |
drews, secretary to the Society of the Friends
of Universal Peace and the Rights of Man, at
Stockport.


This letter, though of a pretty old date,
seems to have deserved attention; it shows
the extraordinary diligence and attention with
which the making prosclytes to this cause,
was pursued in that part of the country, as
well as in many others. That letter and the
answer to it must be read.

[See pages 825 & 829.]

Gentlemen, the next witness is John
Coates ; he says he is an apprentice to Frank-
low, who lived at number one, China Walk,
Lambeth; he says he was bound apprentice
in November last; that Franklow used to be
out late of nights; that there used to be ex-
ercising with tire arms up stairs twice a week,
about eight o’clock in the evening; that
Shelmerdine and Williams were two of the
persons who used to be there, there were
about eight or nine of them; he supposes
them to be the same persons, the window
shutters were shut; his master used to go to
Worcester-street, in the Borough, he does not
know what he did there; he says the arms
they used at his master’s house were kept on
the first floor, he did not know where they
were put after his master was apprehended ;
he remembers seeing cartouch boxes in the
cutting room, they ‘lay upon the board; he
once saw his master in regimentals, and that
Williams had a uniform, he saw his master
in regimentals one Sunday morning in the
house.

James Walsh was at Chalk-farm when
Richter read the resolutions; he heard the
word convention mentioned by him, and that
they had formed a correspondence with dif-
ferent societies in different towns; that was
all he could speak to, except that two hun-
dred thousand copiesof the resolutions were to
printed; and he says that Thelwall spoke
very violently.

Thomas Green was the next witness; he
says he isa perfumer, that he also deals in
knives and cutlery ware; he says it is cus-
tomary for perfumers to deal in such articles ;
he says he had knives with a catch in the
back, he had three dozen of them from Shef-
field, packed in small parcels, he sold four-
teen of them, he can name three or four per-
sons who bought single knives, one was the
prisoner at the bar, and that he sent him six
others ina package; that he was to make
choice of one, and if he could dispose of the
rest he might; he did not book them, and
four of them were returned after Hardy was
apprehended, he had not called on him before ;
he said he sold one to one Mr. Billington, and
one to Groves; he had them from Scotheld
and Company, at Sheftield; that he had
dealt with another person in Sheffield; they
have riders; one happened to bring patterns
of this kind of knife, which before he had
seen in shops in the Strand, and other places,
and so he ordered a parcel; he says ho docs
not know how Hardy came to know that he
had them; he says that in Compton-street

he ate his supper with one of these knives, |
Pearce had another which was rather better
Gnished, and which he had not bought of the
witness.

Upon his cruss-exanination, he says he
used such a kuife as this seven years ago ;
that he has tweuty of the three dozen he
bought left now; most cutler’s shops have .

them ; that he sold them in the common !

course of his trade. As to Groves, he says
he came to purchase a knife, and he remarked
the utility of the knife; he did not tell Groves
that he had suld two or three hundred of
them, but Groves asked him if le had sold
many, he told him yes, he not liking to dis-
courage the sale of his own goods; he says
he did not desire Groves to speak low, be-
cause the parlour door was open, and his wife
was a damned aristocrat, he did not use such
ao expression; he did nut desire Groves to
speak low; that the knives lay openly in the
glass case for sale; he says he did not keep
them to scll to mischievous people, and he
does not recollect saying a word about his
wife, or using the word aristocrat, and that he
never wished to conceal from his wife that he
sold these knives.

Now here, undoubtedly, there is a flat con-
tradiction between him and Groves; they are
both witnesses called on the part of the

crown; they certainly put you under a di-{

lemma, and make it difficult for you to be sa-
tisfied that Groves is a person who is entitled
to credit for what he has said; at the same
time though Groves is contradicted in this
particular by this witness, he is contradicted
in no other particular where witnesses might
have been called to contradict him, that is a

circumstance for your consideration, upon j : ,
i ' members the fact of their dispersion—he says

which you will exercise your judgment, I am
not not at all pressing you to incline to give
more credit to a witness who has been con-

tenor of his evidence upon the whole entitles
him to.
The next witness, is Edward Hodson, a

printer; he declined answering whether he ‘

printed a particular paper which was shown
to him, but he admits that one Hodgson ap-
plicd to him to print it, and brought the ma-
nuscript. It is a hand-bill respecting the
Ins and Outs, that we are in danger from the
French, and from the Hessians and Hanove-
rians, in cither case we should get arms, and
learn how to use them—you recollect the
paver,” -He says, that from all he observed,
¢ has no reason to suppose that they had
any thing but areform ot parliament in view,
that it was no part of their plan to attack the
king, he never heard any such thing, or to
displace the Lords—he would not-have con-
tinued a moment longer in ihe society, if he
had supposed any such thing.
He says, that upon Hardy and Adams being
taken up, and reports being in circulation,

that under pretence of reform, they bad
other objects in view, he left them—be sis
he understuod the Convention was a th.sz

: not determined upon—that they were to take

the advice of the societies in the country,
whether they were to assemble a conven
—he says there was no idea of their makmng
laws, or introducing the anarchy of Frauce
into England—he became a member im the
month of February—he says he has read
printed copy of the resolutions at Chalk-tarm,

e has seen a printed copy of the pirceedings
on the twentieth of January; he DO
thing of their having any thing to d with
the works of Paine—that several peorie ap-
plied to him to priat the proceedinz at

; Chalk-farm.

The next witness, is George Ross, of Ecm-
burgh; he says he became a member of the
Society of the Friends of the People in Ed:0-
burgh, about the end of the year 1793 ; that
he was a member of the British Conventwa;
he says he made a mistake at first, as to the
year, it was in 1792, thathe was made a
member; that at the end of November, «
the beginning of December, 1793, the dele-
gates from other socicties in Scotland attend-
ed, and some from England; he says he re
ceived some letters from one Stock, in Edm
burgh, who was a member of another socet:
of the same nature; he says he sent several
of thenrinto the country; onetoa 0 of
the name of Miller, at Perth, which is now
produced; he sent one to Strathaven, and
one to Paisley; he is not certain whether be
sent one to Dundee; he cannot be certain
whether he was present at the vote of unto
that they came to in the Convention, whes
they extended their hands; he says he re-

is the

the circular letter produced

€ | which was sent by him, to diffarent parts of
tradicted in one particular, than the whole '

Scotland.

Upon his cross-examination he says, that
his only object was, a reform in the House of
Commons, he never thought there was an
intention to attack the king’s person, or his
prerogatives; they did not at all consider
themselves as the parliament of Great Ba
tain, but they meant to consider of proper
means of petitioning; he says he perceived
nothing of any other intent; nothing was
said against the king, that he heard; he says
it would have been foolish enough to attempt
to make laws to bind the people—he says the
British Convention consisted of about two
hundred persons—they had no arms to at
tack the magistrates ; there was no prepara
tion of the means for resistance : he said they
had nothing illega] in their thoughts ; if they
had thought it illegal, they would not have
done it, or if they hal thought it dangerous
to the king, they would not have done it
He says the Convention consisted of le of
all ranks, smpstly people of good character,
people of sober lives and good morals;
says he does not recollect being present ata

patculer resolution inquired after ;—he says,
thinks he was present when the resolu-
tion was come to about the Habeas Corpus
Act, to meet at a place to be appointed by the |
secret committee. He says, Downie was a
member of the society; he understood the |
Convention of Emergency to be called to pe- ,
tition parliament; that he would not have
agreed te a convention upon any other terms;
that he understood they were to specify a par-
ticular refurm in their petition.

Arthur M’Ewan says, he lives at the Water
of Leith, he remembers the dispersion ef the ;
convention by the magistrates; that a large
committee of union met in consequence of it,
of which Watt was a member; there was
another committee, a sub-committee, called -
a committee of Ways and Means; that Stock,
Bourke, Aitcheson, Bonthron, Downie, Watt,
and hiinself, were of that coinmittee, to look
into the affairs of Skirving ; he never saw the |
letter inquired after.

He says, that Watt read to them a plan to
seize the lord justice Clerk, and the rest of |
the lords of council and session, and the lord |
provost of Edinburgh; to kindle a fire at the ;
Excise-office, in the New Town, and that par- |
ties should be stationed in the street, to in-
tercept the soldiersas they came down from !
the castle; the fire was todraw the military
from the castle; coming down to a point, ;
they were to be inclosed by two parties; that -
different parties were to seize the banking .
houses in Edinburgh, and commissioners |
were to be appointed to demand the cash ,
from the banks; he did not know who were '
to execute this, only the sub-committee were j
present when this was disclosed ; the witness |
said, he objected to all this, he would not!
agree to any thing that should disturb the
peace, or shed the blood of his countrymen;
that Bonthron agreed with him, and no far-
ther communication was made at that time. |

He says, atanother meeting Watt produced
a copy of a proclamation, prohibiting the re-
moval of corn, grain, hay, and meal; that '
persons were not to remove the same from !
their respective places of abode; there was a
copy of an address to the king, ordering him |
to dismiss his present ministers, and to put |
anend to this bloody war, or else he might
expect bad consequences to ensue—this was
to be sent to the king, on the morning after |
the attack. The witness said, these things -
did not belong to the cause of a reform, and |
he would have nothing to do with it.

He says, he went with Watt, to Robert ;
Orrock’s, to bespeak pikes; Orrock sketched
out one, Watt said, he had four thousand to
send to Perth, besides what he had to distri-
bute about Edinburgh; Stock was of the
committee, he said he was going to London,
or Bristol, and would wait on Hardy by the
desire of Watt, who proposed to send a [etter
to Hardy; Stock undertook to take this let-


pondence was to be conducted, something wag
to signify, that the aristocrats were doing so
and so, and the democrats so and so; Stock
was to call again upon Watt; the witness saw
him no more,

Upon his cross-examination he says, that
parliamentary reform was the object of the
society; that the society to which he be-
longed, consisted of about twenty; that he
attended the convention about half, a dozen:

nights ; that they meant to obtain a parlia-
: mentary retorm, by a petition, and that it was

to have come under consideration, the night
they were dispersed. You see there was a
scroll of a petition brought forward, and &
negative put upon it, in a certain way, by
calling for the order of the day; but in that
story of his he must be mistaken; he says it
was to come under consideration the night of
the dispersion; that there were near two
hundred members; that they had no arms >
he never heard of an intention to use force ;
that the rctorm most of them spoke of, was
universal suffrage, and annual parliaments,
and some were for triennial parliaments; he
says, there was nothing said, touching the
King, or the Lords; he cannot undertake to
say, what that committee of union was for,
he did not hear that it was for the purpose of
establishing a new convention ; he says Skirv-
ing’s letter was read at a meeting, and a sube
committee appointed. He says, he heard the
delegates were to lave another convention, of
the time, and place of meeting of which, they
were to get information ; he could not say as
to the purposes of the new convention.

William Middleton says, he searched the’
house of Watt, on the fifteenth of May, but
nothing turns upon that.

Gentlemen, this was the evidence they gave
of a conspiracy breaking out in Scotland,
after the dispersion of the cunvention, which
it is insisted upon by the attorney-general,
makes a part of this general plan, in this
country; that by possibility, Hardy's circular
letter, or some other of Hardy’s publications,
or the publication of the Sheffield committee,
or of the Constitutional Society might have
excited this, is certainly true, and therefore
the evidence could not be rejected ; but as to
the bringing home to the prisoner, Hardy,
that he was implicated directly in this con-
spiracy, the evidence docs not appear to me
to go that length, for all the conversation
ahout a letter to be carried by Stock to
Hardy, comes to nothing, for Stock never did
deliver that letter; Muargarot and Gerrald,.
who were delegates with Hardy’s participation
‘ from the Corresponding Society, do not ap-
' pear to have been involved in this conspiracy
| —they were, I believe, in custody at the time,
| and upon the whole, therefore, that does ra-
ther seem to have been something that broke
out in consequence of the general irritation
| which had been so improperly produced by

ter. Stock took a slip of paper, and gave | the pains that had been taken throughout the
him some token by which this same corres- | country to irritate it; but I do not see any

thing that makes it probable, that Hardy,
personally, was concerned in this part of the
conspiracy, or that he knew any thiag at all
about it.

Gentlemen, the next witness, Schaw, pro-
duces a paper, found upon Thelwall, and Nost
produces a paper, fount! upon Martin; these
two papers are proved to have been Martin’s
hasdaecliivng they were found after Hardy’s
apprehension; but they become evidence
even in this ease, against Hardy, from the
éircumstance of their having been proved, by
two witnesses, to have been in Martin's pos-
session, before Hardy was apprehended ; they
were, therefore, papers that existed before
that time.

Now this paper purports to be projected
fesolutions for the meeting at Chalk-farm ;
they differ essentially from the resolutions
that were agreed to, and appear to be of a
more direct and violent east than those reso-
lutions were, because they point immediately
to the person of the king; it will be proper
that you should hear that paper now’read,

‘ [See page 870.]

- Gentlemen, what is conveyed by that last
rosolution? That itis the bounden duty of the
people to punish all traitors against the na-
tion, and that the following words are now not
a part of the oath of allegiance—‘ That it is
not lawful to take arms against the king ;”
a more dangerous and more treasonable pa-
er, one has hardly ever scen: of this paper
have to remark, that there is no evidence
which directly brings it home {o the prisoner,
Hardy, but the evidence stands thus—This
has been manifestly a draught of a resolution
which, in the mind of the drawer, was in-
tended for a meeting of the London Corres-
ding Society, about that time ; the date to

Wt is the fourteenth of April; upon that four-
teenth of April the Chalk-farm resolutions
were proposed; the paper was found upon
Thelwall, who was present at the Chalk-farm
Meeting, aud taking an active part there;
suoh a paper, therefore, found upon Thelwall
and Martin, two members of this society,
seems bubtco manifestly to prove what the
ideas were that were floating in the minds of
these people, at the time of those resolutions;
and they certainly show, that very dangerous
designs were coneeived by some of those
people, to be brought forward, at that time,
In some shape er other: how it was settled—
in what consultation—by what persons—there
is no direct evidence; that you can only
gaess at; they are persens that usually trans-
acted the business for this Corresponding
Society; you know who they were; Hardy
was a principal one.—Whether that is suffi-
cient to convince you, that he had any thing
to do with it, or whether you have reason to
think, that, bad as it is, it has nothing to do
with ang body, but these upen whom it was
found, that is matter fer your consideration;
but it certainly shows, that, in the minds of


(iss

these persons, there was danger, of the ma
alarming degree: of violence, that one as
hardly ventute to contemplates it leads to:
Gegree of wickedness, that one could hardy
suppose to be possible.—With this evideaa
the case on the part of the prosecution closes,
and now I have to read to you, therefore, the
evidence on the part of the prisoner.

The first witness is Florimond Geddy;
he says, he is 2 member of the London Ca-
responding Society; he was of the same &
vision as Hardy, number two; he says, bex-
tended very regularly; he dves net keor
that he missed ange for two years; hess.
that he ceased to be a member when Hatr
was taken us that Hardy was very nny
absent; that he was perfectly well acquaint
with him; that he hardly ever miss i

that it was no part of his view ta make ay

was very peaceable; that there were soxé
resolutions in print, and that the paper co
tained a cprrect account of what passed; be
thought that all that was transacted, at bob
places, was agreeable to the law of the land.

He says, it is true, that the society sent de
legates to the Scotch Convention; that bis-
self was notin office; he has heard ofa secret
committee ; he never heard who thcy were;
he ducs not think that the body knew who
the secret committee were ; he knew nothing
of their proceedings, and he did not choose 1
attend after Hardy was taken up.—te sas,
Margarot and Gerrald were their delegates;
he may have seen the address of the sisth of
August, 1792; he heard of a circular letter,
which was sent to Scotland to call a conves-
tion; he does not know how it got there, but
he heard of it at his division, that this was
call a convention: he says, that the proce
ings at the Globe Tavern, on the twentieth
of} anuary, and the proceedings at Chalk
Farm, were peaceable and consti ;
that there might be songs after dinner, bat
ey were not in general introdaced ; he 93

wail's songs; he ‘thought ttiere was pp ham


in them; there was one very long one; he
eanneot recollect the title of its three of these
songs were printed in one sheet of paper; he
eaanot recollect the title of them.

The only observation that occurs to me,
upon this man’s evidence is, the distance at
which he seems to have been kept from all
knowledge of what was doing; there was a
secret committee, which seem to have ma-
naged all the material concerns of the society;
end it is remarkable, that this person whe
was connected with Hardy, did noteven know
ery thing with regard to the cireumstance of
the pikes; whetier Hardy’s not communicat-
tug it happened mercly by accident, which I
think most probable, or whether there was
any reason tor not letting this man into the
business of the pikes, is a goed deal uncertain,
wpon this state of the evidence; but, if other
people were let into it, why this man was not
as not easy to see.

Francis Dowling says, he was a member of
this suciety, and belonged to Hardy’s division;
their only object was, a reform in the House
of Commons; they had no thoughts against
the King or the House of Lords; they had no
idea of opposing the government by force.
The object of the convention, he says, was, to

the sense of the delevates, from different
ivisions, to obtain a reform in the House of
Commons, and that there was no intention of
proceeding by feree in any meraler of the so-
ciety ; he says, that he was two years and a
half ia the division, and never saw or heard of
a letter, from Sheftield, about pikes; he was
a member of this society from the commence-
ment ef it: he says, be dined at the Crown
and Anchor, on the second of May; there was
some music, buthe dees not know what it
was. He says, he was at Chalk Farm; he
saw the resolutions at the Globe-tavern, but
lee does not recollect what they were; he was
once delegate, tor six months; he ceased to
be se, five or six months ago.

He says, he knew Speuce’s shop ; he bought
pamphicts there; he has scen Franklow
there, but never heard of any exercising there,
till he heard of it now ; hesays, he hus heard of
@ committee of correspondence; if there was
one, it was voted by ballot; he knows Hodg-
son the hatter; he knows nothing of any se-
eret committee being appointed, after the ap-
prehension of tardy; that he has never been
in Academy-court, Chancery-lane; he never
heard of the Shefield letter, till he saw it in
the report ef the secret committee; he never
heard of the order to stick the bills up in the
aight; Carter, who stuck up the bills, receiv-
ed the money ; whether the bill was criminal
he eapnet tell; he did not hear all the con-
_ of ae resolutions ; the fee conduct

sokstions, without hearing them distinctly,
but that others attended to them; that he

which the majority in these essemblics, I
@are say, was very often obtained. f


Alexander Wills edys, he was between two
atid three years a member of the Correspond-.
ing Society; he says, the object of the society
was a parliamentary reform in the House of
Commons ; that they were full of respect, ho-
nour, and fidelity, to the king; he never had
reason to think others intended otherwise ;
never to his knowledge, was it intended to do
any thing by force; thathe would! not have
continued in the society, if there had been
eny istention of doing any thing by force ; he
has not been 8 member of the society since
the king of France suffered ; that the prisoner
is of an amiable charaeter, and a good mem-
ber of society.

The witness says, he id 2 dancing-master ;
he is also a member of the Constitutional 80-
ciety; he was introduced by Heleroft, after
he became a member of the Constitutional
Societys he wished to hear speakers that
were clever men; he took his rule of polities
from news-pepers, from public report, and
from debates in both Houses of Parliament ;
he was but little acquainted with the proceed-
ings; he did not see the books at the meet-
ings; he never knew any of their transac-
tions, which might bring the people or those
they ethployed, into any difficulties; he may,
he says, have given a shilling, or five shil-
lings, a guinea, two guineas, or five guineas,
te assist Carter ; he says, he often gives five
guineas, and he does not know whom he
gives it to; then, when pressed a little, he
says, he might have given some shillings, if
not guineas; at last he said, he did not give
guineas, but he did give a few shillings; he
says, he was asked, in one of the societies, to
contribute, in Compton-street ; he says, he is
not sure he gave more thaa that. He never
heard of a seeret committee, or committee of
correspondence, and never saw any letter
that been written to the prisoner. I
think, notwithstanding that strange Hourish
of his, about the five guineas, one may sately
conclude that there was no harm in this wite

ness.

Archibald Hunter was a member of the
London Corresponding Society about twenty
months; he knows the prisoner; he belong-
ed to the same division with Hardy ; he says,
the object of the society was, to obtain a par-
liamentary reform; he never understuod any
thing else but a reform in the Commons
House of Parliament; the King, and the
House of Lords, to remain as they were; he

Rights of Man; he remembers their writing
to the Cunstitutional Society, to have mem-
bers associated; he met with them at the

Bell, in Exeter-street, before the society was |

formed ; he was no delegate; he does not re-
collect who was the fitst chairman ; Margarot
might be for any thing he knew; he believes
Hardy to be one of the first that met; and a
person of the name of Black, and a Mr. Gow,
who is since dead; that there was no clergy-
man or physician among them; that there
were thirty or forty, or more, when they met
the greatest number; the first time he came,
perhaps, there might be twenty; he believes
Margarot was the principal man in forming
the original laws, but he cannot recollect who
assisted.

Alexander Gordon, a shoe-maker, says, he
has known the prisoner twenty years; that
he fsa sober, honest, industrious, peaceable
man.

John Bogue, a carpenterand cabinet-maker,
says be has known the prisoner near ten
years; that he is an industrious, honest,
christian man.

Mathew Dickey, a Scotch factor, says, he
has known the prisoner upwards of five ycars;
that he is a strictly honest, upright man;
their intercourse was entirely upon business,

Jatnes Hardy says, he is not related to the
prisoner; he lives in Smithfield; he has
known him from 1779, or 1780; he gives
him the best of characters.

They then call Mr. King, and the purpose
for which they call Mr. King was, to show,
that a letter, which was enclosed to Hardy, in
Davison’s letter, which Davison’s letter, you
recollect, propused to Hardy a plan for fur-
nishing the society, or any one that wanted
them, with pikes, from Sheflicld; in that let-
ter, a letter to a society at Norwich was sent
enclosed; Mr. King is not able to speak ex-
actly to it, but he says, he does recollect the
circumstance of a letter being found, unopened
at the time, but he cannot take upon him to
say, whether that was the Norwich letter or
no.
David Martin, of Sheffield, says, he is a
member of a society there, for a reform in
the Commons House of parliament, by legal
and constitutional means; he says, that-he
had no reason to believe that the object of
’ -any other person, was different from his; . he

e has been a mem- !


had not the most distant idea of doing any
thing by force; he says, they sent delegates

| to Scotland, to co-operate with other dele-

gates, to obtain a reform, by a petition to par-
lament; he says, they hoped the effect of a
general co-operation, would be sufficient to
induce the parliament to grant the petition ;
that it was not their design to compel by
force; he says, he would not have remained
in the society, if it had; he had no intention
to attack the King, nor to attack the Lords;
he says, he knows a person of the name of
Gale, he was an.active man in the society, he
believes he is not row at Sheffield, he has
no house there; the witness was made an
associated memLer of the Constitutional So-
ciety, in 1792; he has heard of the proceed-
ings of the Scotch Convention, he saw an
account of them in the Gazetteer of Edin-
burgh, he did not approve of that part relat-
ing to a secret committee—he says, being at
the outside of the people, on the Castle-hill,
he did not hear the lution to petition the
House of Commons no more—he says, Yorke
and he had not exactly the same opinion, as
toa plan of reform in parliament; he does
not know who are the editors uf the Patriot,
but has heard that Brown was one, which
Brown was a delegate to the Scotch Conven-
tion; he thought him a peaceable, and well-

| disposed man ; he says, there were letters be-

tween their society, and the Stockport Society,
and he thought they also were peaceably dis-
posed.—He says, he was not in the secret,
that the motion for a petition to parliament,
which Broomhead made at the Sheffield
meeting, was made to be negatived; he says,
whatever Mr. Brown might write or think, or
whatever he migit do, the society gave him
no authority to act for them at Edinburgh,
except in a legal, and constitutional manner :
he admits that he had read Yorke’s speech.
Edward Oakes, a plater at Sheffield, says,
he has been a member of the society, from
1791 to the present time; he says, he at-
tended the meeting, that his object was, to
procure, by lawful and constitutional means,
in co-operation with the rest of the societies,
a reform in parliament; they expected their
petitions would be heard, when made by large
bodies, that it would be more likely to im-
press the parliament; that it was never their
object to use force; he says, he would not
have remained in the society if that had been
their object; they had no object, but a reform
in the House of Commons, and that by peti-
tion. He says, he was upon the Castle-hill,
that he dues not know the terms of the reso-
lution; he was in the society when a dele-
gate was sent to Scotland, he does not recol-
Tect whether the proposition came from Scot-
land, or from themselves; he says, the object
was, to have proper measures considered of, to
obtain a parliamentary reform; he says,
Brown was to express the sense of their so-
ciety; they were to point out the proper way
of addressing parliament, which might. not

de altogether thought of by them, these per-
eons appeared to ii to be more capable of
judging; he thought petitioning from so
tee a body would have weight with parlia-
ment; they had nothing in contemplation
against the king, his title, office, or life; he
says he does not particularly recollect whe-
ther apy thing was said about the House of
Lords; he does not believe the object of the
society extended farther than the representa-
tion of the people in the House of Commons.

He says, he remembers hearing about pikes,
that their society had great apprehensions of
danger from the opposite party, that they had
been threatened and ill used by the opposite
party, and by individuals, who took upon
themselves an authority that they had no
right tu; this was complained of in the so-
ciety ; he says, that it never was designed or
agitated to arm, as a body, to attack the

vernment; if it had been, he should

we known it.—He says, he was a member of
the committee ; he does not know that there
were any of their members in any ways as-
sociated with the Corresponding Society, any
farther than by correspondence ; he did not
constantly attend the committee, and the
committee did not regularly enter their pro-
ceedings ; they were kept by William Broom-
head ; he says he knows Samuel Ashton;
that he corresponded with the society in Lon-
don, tor their society; he has seen Ashton
write, but he did not attend to his writing ;
he says that the letters that were sent were
not altogether known to the society at large;
the body trusted to the committee ; that the
committee sometimes reported, but had no
fixed time for doing it; he says, Paine’s Rights
of Man had been introduced into the society,
hefore they were declared to be a libel; he
does not know whether a letter of the 14th of
March, to Adams, was sent; he speaks of
writing to Mr. Horne Tooke, and to the Con-
Stitutional Society ; two letters were read ;
one of them was enclosed to Hardy, in answer
to a letter from him, to know what it was they
were doing; the other was a letter, of the
same date, found upon Adams.

The witness admitted the letters to be
Ashton’s hand-writing, and signed by him ;
it says they were resolved to obtain a. radical
zeferm of the country, as soon as prudence
nd discretion weill Pormutt 3 and they request
that the villages and towns may unite in the
sentiments expressed by Paine.—The witness
says, he never read that letter at all; he does
not know that it was ever communicated to
him ; he does net know whether it might be
communicated to the eocicty, because he did
Rot attead all their meetings ; he says there

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Mr. Stuart sys
he never heard of this letter of the 26th
May, to the Constitutional Society, and
thinks he did not know at the time of any
their members having been associated
the Constitutional Society ; he was ssted #
to some gentlemen having left the Sead
the Friends of the People, and he says bee
had, and that other members bave bem
added to that society ; he was asked lee whe
ther lord Daer, a member of the Bdebugh
Convention, had been expelled from the #
ciety, he says he is still a member.

William Dewsnap, a ragor-maker, st oa
field, sayshe was a member of the Shed
Society; that their object was, 3 reforenaino
in the Commons House of parliameat by
titioning; that they went vm the plan of!

that Brown hed ne other author)

them; he savs, he has heard people speak of
itl-treating the society; that there were in-
Hammatory letters in the Sheffield papers
from one Russell ; he says, however, he is al-
mosta stranger to the pike business, as to the
general object, ifit had been to have armed,
it roust have been known to him, he must
have heard of it, the question was never agi-
tated in the committee, or in the society ; he
never heard of any intention to resist, or to
attack government, he had no such object
himself, and he has reasonable hope that the
society had not; he says, the society pub-
lished the duke of Richmond’s letter toinform
the societies at large of the principles they
meant to go upon, and they adhered strictly to
those principles.

Upon his cross-examination he says, the
object was, all along, to obtain a reform by pe-
tition; that that was negatived on the Castle-
hill, he heard no voice in the affirmative; he
says he remained a member of the society,
after that; he has some recollection of a vote
of approbation of the proceedings of the
Scotch Convention, but he was not then pre-
sent; he says, he did not know of the contriv-
ance to have the vote for the petition nega-
tived, neither from Broomhead nor Camage,
and he has had correspondence with Broom-
head for fifteen years; he says, he did not
know that any petition to his majesty was
prepared ; he says he can form no belief as
to the hand-writing of Ashton. ‘

Edward Smith, a cutler in Sheffield, says,
he was a member of the society in 1791;
that their object was, to obtain a parliamen-
tary reform upon the duke of Richmond's
plan, io his letter tocolonel Sharman ; he un-
derstood by the expression Rights of Man in
their letters, equal re prereaIAUOn in parlia-
ment in the House of Commons; he never
heard any thing in the society that they
wished to attack the king's title or his pre-
rogative, but much the other way, nor to
to touch the dignity of the House of Lords ;
he meantto have, as he strangely expressed it
the glorious advantages obtained In 1688;
that he heard nothing of force, he heard no-
thing of arms ’till the hand-bill that threat-
ened them; that upon any good news they
used to fire
there was nothing to provoke this conduct ;
that there wis no regular arming ; he says if
they had determined to arm, Sheffield could
in one day have furnished ten thousand pikes ;
that it never was his wish or object in be-
coming a member of that society, to touch or
aifect his sovereign.

Upon his cross-examination, he says, that
he thought it necessary to provide arms for
his own defence; he does not know how
many did; he says, as to himself, he made
ho application to any magistrate, he says it
jvas put into the Register, a public newspaper
at Sheffield, that they advised people to arm
to assist the magistrates, the advice was to

istols into their houses; that |


invasion, that being the substance of the
hand-bill, which they understood to be
against them, they adopted similar words;
he says, that by equal representation, he
means that every man was to have his vote;
he had read both editions of the Rights of
Man by Mr. Paine; he obtained them bya
subscription of a few friends; that there were
many that had them; that they thought well
of them; that they seldom read them at the
society, but they read them at their own
houses ; they also had other cheap publica-
tions; he says, he was not at the meeting
when they approved of Paine’s works; that
he never took into consideration Paine’s no-
tions of monarchy; that the society did not
adopt that, but they made no protest against
it; that they did not wish to destroy mo-
narchy; he understood the author to be
expressing disaffection; he says, he knew
Yorke at Shefficld, he was at the Castle-hill,
they voted by holding up hands; he never
heard of the address from the society to
France.

His grace the duke of Richmond is then
called, in order to identify a paper which is
represented to be his grace’s plan for a re-
form of parliament; he could not identify
that paper, but produced a paper purporting
to be a letter to a colonel Sharman, containing
a plan fora reform of parliament, and that
letter was read. ‘The plan was for universal
suffrage and annual election, and it stated
that the remedy—that the “nf to obtain it
would be by the people : he did not expressly
name a convention of the people, but, how-
ever, he certainly said enough to put that
expedient into the heads of those who were
eager for such a plan.

Mr. Stuart is then called again; he says,
that he has heard Mardy state his plan to be
universal suffrage and annual parliaments ;
the witness always objected to it, but that
was Hardy's opinion, he always adhered to
the duke of Richmond's plan—he said, that
was the whole object of his society; he was
once in company with him at supper, he
found him a sincere, simple, honest man; he
says he did not know that he had been an
associated member of the Constitutional So-
ciety.

Mr. Sterling produced the minutes of 3
Scotch borough convention, but they could
not be read.

Joseph Strutt of Derby, says, he belonged
to a society there; that a reform in the Com-
mons House of Parliament was their object,
they had no design against the King, or the
House of Lords, and they had no intention te
bring about that reform by force; that upon
their petition being rejected, their society
never met again.

Mr. Sheridan was then called; he says, ke
once saw the prisoner, that it was in the b
ginning of March, 1793; be had given notice
of an intention to bring forward an inquiry in

[1358

atm against domestic enemies and forei arliament into the cause of the alarms at
5 gn |?

that time ;* -that upon that occasion he sent
to Hardy, who, he understood, could give
him information; he came to him, and he
conversed with him; Hardy stated his whole
object to be obtainin,
reform on the duke of Richmund’s plan, and
that he was reddy to give him a sight of his
whole correspondence, to produce all his
papers to him, that he might lay them before
parliament in any manner that he should
think fit; he was asked whether he was or
not an original member of the Constitutional
Society, he said he was, but he had not at-
tended since 1783; there were some questions
whether Mr. Sheridan had said any thing of
books, as well as papers, whether Hardy
offered him books as well as papers; after-
wards he said he could not take upon him
to be sure that Hardy mentioned books ; that
his offer was, to put him in possession of all
the papers.

r. Francis was then called; he saw Mr.
Hardy twice, firstat his own house, and after-
wards at Mr. Francis’s house; the Corres-
ponding Society had thanked Mr. Francis for
a speech he had made in parliament in the
year 1793, and had expressed a desire that it
should be printed ; upon that occasion he saw
Mr. Hardy: he says, before that time Hardy had
been sent to hi. to desire him to present a po-
tition on the subject of a reform in parliament;
that they wished their delegates might be ad-
mitted to come to his house, accordingly
they were admitted, and they brought a
petition—there were four of them; he told
them he objected to the prayer of their peti-
tion, which was for universal representation
according to the duke of Richmond’s plan;
he says, that Hardy seemed a remarkably rea-
sonable, quiet man; that they were very
ready at the argument in support of universal
suffrage, they said they only followed the
opinions of the duke of Richmond ; he says,
he told them they should have left the re-
medy in general terms to the wisdom of the
house; they said they were sorry they had
not known that sooner, but that now they
could not alter it, as the petition was signed
by a great number of people, and must be
presented that day, because Mr. Grey was
that day to make his motion.

- Mr. Francis says, they did not declare that
they would accept nothing else, but they ap-
peared to him to adhere to universal represen-
tation, There isa little puzzle about a letter
which had been written to Mr. Francis, and
his answer ; they had in that letter thanked
him for what he had said about a radical
reform on a broad basis; he says that was not
exactly the tenor of his speech, but he did
not think it right to enter into rnuch alterca-
tion upon the subject, he gave them a civil
answer, and there it ended.

The Earl of Lauderdale-says, he receiveds
letter from the Society of the Friends s
the People at Portsburg, near Edinburgh;
that he saw Skirving upon that occas,
and he supposes the application was mx
to him in consequence of a conversatxa
with Skirving ; Skirving represented that ther
wished to have men of education, that thes
might be prevented from falling into absr-
ditics, which they should otherwise be lable
to fall into; he says, he had no reason ta
suspect that any thing more was meant than
to obtain Universal Suffrage and Annual Par-
liaments; he heard nothing of force, and has
No reason to think there was any intertwa of
force. He was asked if he had beard wy
thing of Skirving’s letter to Hardy in Jak,
1793, which is a remarkable letter, his lord
ship says he had not ;—this, I think, is the
evidence on the part of the defendant.

Gentlemen, I would, if the day were not s
far spent, and my own strength too much e-
hausted, now go on and finish what I haves
say upon this subject, but I foresee it mast
necessarily run into an inconvenient length,
both to myself and to you; and, therefore, 1
believe I must trouble you to attend to-morrow
morning, and then I shall hope in a tew hous
to release you.

It being now thirty-five minutes pastelevet
o’clock at night, the Court adjourned to Wed-
nesday morning, nine o'clock.

Session House in the Old Bailey, Wednesda,
November 5th, 1794.

PRESENT,

Lord Chief Justice Eyre, Lord Chief Bareo
Macdonald, Mr. Baron Hotham, Mr. Jus
tice Buller, Mr. Justice Grose, and others
his Majesty’s Justices, &c.

Thomas Hardy set to the bar.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—Gentlemen of
the Jury ; Last night, at a late hour, I finished
the summing up of the parol evidence, and
some parts of the written evidence, which
seemed to be more immediately connected
with the parol evidence on both sides, except
that I aid not state to you the protest in the
House of Lords, which was read to you, by
the consent of the attorney-general, on the
part of the prisoner. I did not state it to you
at that time, because it did not appear to me
to be in its mature evidence. It is something
that has passed in the Parliamentary History
of this country, from whence arguments
might be drawn, on the part of the prisoner,
to evidence the purity honesty of bis in-
tentions, and, in my judgment, it is in thet
lew nay that itcan be made use of in hs

ehalf.

Having thus finished the summing up of
the evidence, I may say to you, that this
cause, this great and momentous caus be

tween the king and the prisoner at the bar,
is at length brought to the point of conclu-
sion; and it must be a satisfaction to the
mind of every honest man that this cause has
been so conducted, has been proceeded upon,
and has been attended to by you with so much
patience and temper, that there is reason to
expect that your minds have been sufficiently
intourmed on the subject to enable you to dis-
cover its true merits, and to pronounce a ver-
dict, which in the first place will be satis-
factory to your own consciences, and as such,
cannot but be satisfactory lo the cominu-
nity.

Gentlemen, it is as great a satisfaction to
me, as I can feel in the exercise of so paintul
aduty as that which has been cast upon me,
to reflect that upon this occasion there is, I
think, no possible chance of our being en-
tangled in any difficulties in point of law.
The verdict in this case, will not proceed, and

ou will receive no directions from me that
it ought to proceed, on any narrow or technical

rounds. The overt-act charged in this in-
dictment, is in substance, that the prisoner
at the bar, and those who have been con-
cerned with him, have cunspired to depose
the king, and to subvert the monarchy of this
country; and this is charged, and always has
been considered, as an overt-act of the treason
of compassing the death of the king. Itis
indeed a known presumption of law, acknow-
ledged by the best writers upon the law, and
particularly by every one of those writers who
have been referred to by the counsel on both
sides, that he who conspires to depose the
king, compasses and imagines the death of
the king; and it never has been made a ques-
tion, whether the compassing and imagining
the death of the king was the primary intent
conceived in the mind, and was prior to the
conspiracy to depose him, or whether the
conspiracy to depose the king, must necessa-
ily, from the nature of the charge, be subse-
a to the compassing and imagining the

eath of the king; I say it isnot to be put
to you that the compassing and imagining the
death of the king is to be proved a conception
in the mind, prior to the conception of de-
posing the king. The conspiracy to depose
the king is evidence of compassing and ima-
gining the death of the king, conclusive in its
Nature, so conclusive that it is beconte a pre-
sumption of law, which is in truth nothing
more than a necessary and violent presump-
tion of fact, admitting of no contradiction.
Who can doubt that the natural person of the
king is immediately attacked and attempted
by him who attempts to depose him.

Gentlemen, I shall employ no more time in

discussing such a question; many, many
hours were spent at the bar, in this discus-
sion; but, on the part of the prisoner, it was
manifest, that, after the discussion, the argu-
ment broke down under the case, and it be-
came impossible. for either of the gentlemen
to set himself distinctly to maintain this pro-


position, that an honest man could fairly
doubt whether he who conspires to depose
the king, has compassed or imagined his
death.

Gentlemen, you will therefore proceed to
the examination of the fact, and I am most
cordially disposed to agree with the counsel
for the prisoner, that, if he is this day to be
convicted, he ought to be proveablement at~
taint; i.e. the proof ought to be clear and
convincing. I avoid using the word direct,
lest I should entangle you in a difficulty, as to
the nature of the proof; it may consist of a
train of circumstances, provided the result is
such as shall leave no doubt in your minds.
The law of the land is perfectly clear, that
such proof is as legal, and therefore ought to
be as satisfactory, as the most positive and
direct proof that can be offered

Gentlemen, the question of fact may bé
shortly stated thus :—Whether the prisoner,
and the other persons, have conspired to sub-
vert the monarchy, and whether they have
set on foot a project of a convention of the
people, in order to effect it?

Gentlemen, I have employed a part of that
time since the Court broke up, which it was
necessary enough for me to have devoted to
sleep, in endeavouring to take such a review
of the evidence in this cause, as might enable
me to lay the questions of fact between the
king, and the prisoner at the bar, with some
tolerable distinctness, before you, that you
might see where the matter hinged, and that
you might be the better enabled to apply your
attention and consideration to the different
points of the case. I do not know whether I
shall succeed, or not, but I do hope I shall be
able tw point out to you the leading features
of this case, in a way that may be of some
use to you in forming your judgment.

I begin with stating to you, that I think it
ought to be conceded to this prisoner, upon
the whole result of this evidence, that he had
set out originally upon that which is called
the Duke of Richmond's Plan of a Reform in
Parliament; that is, upon a plan to obtaina
representation of the people in the Commons
House of Parliament, by Universal Suftrag
and Annual Election; and I think it will
incumbent on those who sustain the prose=
cution, to satisfy you that the prisoner, and
the other persons who have been concerned
with him, whether irritated by their own en-
thusiasm, or by the example of France, have
departed trom that plan, and have entered
into a criminal pursuit of another object ;—
another object, in the opinion of very wise
men, not very far removed from that which
was originally their object (and it is that
proximity which has made a laboured pro-
mulgation of this doctrine of universal suf-
frage and annual election, so dangerous to the
community); the object [ mean to point out
to you, is, the substituting, in the room of an
improvement of the representation in the
Commons House of Parliament, the establish-

45s

ment of a government by a representation of
the people only 3.@ pure democracy, which
may undoubtedly be comprehended under the
Lords, “ a fulland free Representation of the
People.”

Gentlemen, in the mass of the written evi-
dence which has been laid before you, there
are to be found passages, and those not ex-
tremely numerous, which will be fit to be
submitted to your consideration, as grounds
from whence the prosecutors have drawn
their conclusion, and by which they are to
support it; that this departure from the ori-
ginal plan has taken place, and that the pri-
soner at the bar has entered into the criminal
pursuit imputed to him; the passages in the
evidence to which I particularly refer you, are
those, in the first place, which mark the con-
duct of the popular societies, in which the
prisoner is implicated, in the course of the
year 1792, prior to their presenting their ad-
dresses to the National Convention of France:
when you have considered this evidence, you
will have then to consider those addresses to
the National Convention, with the circum-
stances belonging to them. After you have
seen and considered those addresses, you will
then have to look at their subsequent con-
duct, to be collected from their written trans-
actions, down to the time of the dispersion of
the British Convention, in Scotland, in the
latter end of the year 1793; and then you will
have to consider, and to form your judgment
upon that project of a Convention, which was
tonceived and proceeded upon, to a certain ex-
tent, in the beginning of 1794.

Gentlemen, here I think you will find the
great outline of the charge, upon which, with
such explanations as the rest of the written
evidence will afford, and the additional cir-
cumstances disclosed by the parol testimony,
you are to decide.

I think I may state to you, without troub-
ling you with particular evidence, that it is

lear, from the whole mass of the evidence
which you have heard, that these popular so-
cieties had, in the beginning of the year 1792,
80 conducted ihemeclres as to raise a question
upon themselves, and their conduct, some
time before the addresses to the National Con-
vention took place; you will recollect that it
appeared, from some of the papers which were
read, that there was a society, calling them-
selves, “The Friends of the People,” con-
sisting of men of rank and property, and of
distinctior in the country, who had refused to
correspond with the Constitutional Society,
You will recullect, that the same set of men
had exhorted the Sheffield Society, with whom
they were in correspondence that year, and
had exhorted them in vain, to make an ex-
Plicit declaration of their attachment to the

vernment, as by law established. Some of
these popular societies had gone so far, that a
society, at Stockport, put the question, di-
‘rectly, to the London Corresponding Society,


[1564

by a letter, addressed to the precner ow at
the bar, to know what it was they meant, and
particularly to know, whether Meant to
go on with the House of Lords? That society
intimated their doubts, whether, with the
House of Lords, they could effectuate ther
plan of reform; or, whether with the arpa
who made a part of the House of

liberty of conscience, as they understood it,
could ever be sacetacinny established.

Another society, in the same year, from
Norwich, put the question still more distinctly,
and in a way which could not possibly be mis-
understood ; for they put this direct question
to the prisoner, Hardy, as secretary to the
London Corresponding Society :—Do you m-
tend to rip up the monarchy by the roots? It
is in evidence, they suspected that this hs
letter was a snare, intended for them;
will recollect Lynam’s evidence to that
and that they were on their guard. The pr-
soner, Hardy, for the society, answered both
these letters. To be sure, one might reason
ably have expected that men, who adopted
the duke of Richmond’s plan, with sincerity
of heart, and who meant not to go beyond his
plan, would, when called upon, have most dis-
tinctly avowed the extent of their plan, m
terms which could admit of no equivocatioz,
or exception; that they would have avowed
their dutiful attachment to the king; that
they would have avowed their adherence te
the constitution of the Fovemment, as by law
established, in King, Lords, and Commons;
that they would have left no man to doubt,
and particularly those persons who put the
question to them, what their opinion was
upon these points, on which their opin
was to govern the conduct of others. With
respect to the-present letter, the move reasoa
they had to suspect that letter to be a snare,
laid for them, the more reason they had te
speak out.

What the opinion was that they really en-
tertained, the answers to these two requisi-
tions are supposed to be sufficient to enable
you to discover; the letters and the answers
shall now be read to you; before they are
read, I would observe, once for all, that ma
case of this nature, much stress t net to
be laid on particular expressions. forbid
that men’s lives should depend on nice inter
pretations and constructions of words. I am
against even a very strict interpretation of
actions, to the prejudice of any prisoner; but
sometimes expressions are too strong, some-
times transactions too explicit, to admit of a
doubt as to their real interpretation
meaning.

Gentlemen, hear the answers to these two
reinors sead 3 attend to foo a and se
what it is they do import, ticularly
whether they do import any satisinctony sal
explicit avowal of attachment to the constita-

tion of the country, as by nwcsyabliahed,
King, Lords, aml Chcaesten, ‘

Cae ee A


Gentlemen, all the observations that are to
be made on the particular expressions in these
two answers, have been already made to you
by the counsel, and you will judge of their

roper force. I have no occasion to repeat
tan, Such of them as strike your minds,
clearly and distinctly, are probably well
founded. If it requires much niceness of cri-
tical inguiry to fix the meaning imputed to
the words, I should advise you not to emplo:
yourselves in that sort of criticism. I thin
you would only entangle yourselves, and you
would not see the case in its great outlines,
which I believe is the only way in which it
can be seen truly. One observation only I
shall make on their answer, because it is im-
mediately connected with the history of this
transaction, namely, that, in their answer
they inform the society at Stockport, that they
have resolved on addressing the French Na-
tional Convention, and then follows this ex-
traordinary passage: ‘“ Without entering into
the probable effects of such a measure, effects
which your society will not fail to discover, we
invite you to join us.” What were to be the
probable effects of this measure, which these
persons were to discover? And why did not
oy epaealy avow to this society the whole
of their project, in terms that could admit of
no yosaile equivocation, or doubt? These are
Le only observations which I make on this

tter.

Gentlemen, they state that they had re-
solved to address the National Convention,
and they did, in fact, address it; and it is very
apparent in the evidence, that the society to
which Hardy belonged took the lead in that
measure. ‘They notify it not only to the
Stockport Society, but also to the other socie-
tiea, with whom they were then in correspon-
dence. They transmitted their resolution to
address the Convention to the Society for Con-
Stitutional Information; that society having
declared their approbation of the intention,
the London Corresponding Society transmitted
to them the address, which they meant to
send; the result was, that the Society for
Constitutional Information did not think fit
to join them ia that particular address, but
they also resolved to present an address of
their own to the Convention of France, and
they, in fact, did so. What their objects were
in presenting these addresses, are only darkly
alluded to in the letter of the Corresponding

jiety to the Society at Stockport; but
whatever their objects might be, itis an obser-

vation which arises upon their conduct to- | t J
‘act, there- was little to be doue here, with

wards those two societies to whom they sent
these two letters, and upon their conduct in
thus presenting these addresses, that if, in
order to account for, and to explain the letters,
iv could suppose that they had measures to

p with those societies, the violence of some
to check, the moderation of others to animate,


for them to keep measures with those socie-
ties, and to answer every man in his own
way, so‘as to lose none, and to increase the
number of their followers ; and if you were
disposed, therefore, to attribute the particular
language of these answers to some such ne-
cessity, or policy, yet in respect of their con-
duct to the National Convention of France,
they appear to be perfectly volunteers; to
have no measures to keep with any body,
and to be therefore directly responsible for
all the consequences that might follow from
such addresses. ‘

Gentlemen, it will be necessary to trouble
you with the reading of thése addresses;

ause they, on the part of the prosecution,
insist, that they admit of no explanation
whatever; that they are the measures of
determined Republicans, going out of their
way to express their zeal in the cause of
Republicanism.— You will hear these addresses
read, and you will judge for yourselves, how
far they merit that imputation.

[See pages 522 and 526.)

Such was the language of these addresses,
which were presented to the National Con-
very a France. ; ee

entlemen, it appears from the evidence,
that these addresses were presented by pers
sons appointed from hence. The name of
one of them is J. Frost. The language in
which Frost presented them, you are in pos-
session of; it has been laid before you, in the
course of the evidence, but it may be proper
that you should now hear it read again.

[See page 529.]

I forbear, at this time, to remark on the
conduct of the persons employed to present
these addresses, except so far as that conduct
is connected with the case of the prisoner at
the bar, because, in any other view of it, it is
not before you. The language used by Frost
is connected with the case of the prisoner;
for though not held by the prisoner himself,
nor by the persons who deputed Frost to
deliver the addresses, yet it is brought home
to them, because the language of the presen-
tation of the address is transmitted by Frost
to the societies; and you will find, that, after
they had been informed in what language it
had been presented, an unqualified approba-
tion of the conduct of Frost was given by the
Society for Constitutional Information, of
which Hardy was an associated member.

An observation has been made upon one of
these addresses, which declares, that till the
National Convention of France had begun to

respect to the views of these popular societies,
What connexion the views of these popular
societies could have with the National Con-
vention of France, unless they had begun to
entertain a new idea, or a new interpretation
of the phrase, “ Representation of the people

or any other objects, which made it necessary | by Universal Suffrage and Apnual Electons,”

arising out of the proceedings of the National
Convention of France, or it not arising out of
them, yet to be now adopted, in consequence
of the National Convention of France having
exhibited that great scene on the theatre of
the world, and to be now attempted to be
carried into execution, is for your judgment.
The presenter of these addresses has expressed
an expectation, that felicitations might soon
come over to a National Assembly here.
What that National Assembly was to be,
which was to be established here in Fugland,
and which was to be felicitated by France,
will be a subject for your serious considera-
tion, and must deserve and demand the
deepest investigation.

Gentlemen, I have stated to you, that the
only effect, in this case, which the language
of the delegate, who presented this address,
can have, is in respect of the adoption of it by
the prisoner, and by the persons concerned
with him. It was truly observed, that, if an
agent be employed, it would be cruel to bind
his principal to any thing in which he went
beyond the bounds of his agency. It would

- be cruel to impute the acts of an agent to his
Principal, when that principal never approved
of them ; but, if the principal does approve of
them, there is no hardship in such imputa-
tion; there is no cruelly or hardship whatever
in niaking the principal accountable for the
conduct of the agent, in construing the lan-
guage of the agent to be the language of the
principal.

Gentlemen, you will judge, whether those
concerned to support this prosecution have,
upon solid grounds, or otherwise, branded
these proceedings with rank Republicanism,
and with being a distinct avowal, that every
one of those people was embarked in the
cause of Republicanism: it is an extremely
important point to settle; for, on your review
of the subsequent transactions in this cause,
they will undoubtedly have, and must have a
very different complexion, as they are under-
stood to be the proceedings of determined re-
publicans, or as they are understood to be the
Proceedings of dutiful and loyal subjects to
the king, zealously affected to the constitution
of the country, as established in a King, Lords,
and Commons. Men of the one description
are entitled to a large, liberal, and candid in-
terpretation of all their words and actions.
Men of those other principles must expect to
have their language, sentiments, and conduct
referred to those principles.

Gentlemen, the next head of inquiry for
you will be, the transactions of these societies,
subsequent to the presenting of those ad-
dresses, and prior to the conception of the

resent design of a National Convention in

ngland, which is the immediate subject of
this prosecution; and you will examine,
whether the persons who had taken this ex-
traordinary stepiwtuch seems to have been un-
called for, and to have for its principal object
a public demonstration, that


[188

thus addressed the National Convention.
were actuated by the same principle of &-
mocracy which governed the Convention.) ;1
say, whether the authors of it, and the perscas
concerned in it, have in any manner redeemed
themselves, by their subsequent conduc,
from the imputation which the presenting
these addresses has brought upon them. I
stated to you, that, as far as voting an unqu-
litied approbation goes, they immediately
adopted the comment upon their own condut,
by their own agent, that probably a felicita-
tion would come from France to a Natenal
Assembly in England. There is nehng
done by these societies to discourage the e-
pectation of a National Convention in Ene.
land; you will judge whether they have net
taken very active steps to prepare the way
for it. The acts of these societies, more im
mediately referable to this subject, which
have been laid before you, on the part of the
prosecution, consist chiefly of resolutions, m-
porting warm and unqualified approbation of
the works of two celebrated writers, Thomzs
Paine and Joel Barlow ; the first writing ‘Ipoa
the Rights of Man, and the last on what was
called the Privileged Orders, Parts of these
works have been read to you, and they area
most direct attack on the establishmentot the
monarchy of this country ; and they doatlck
more or less pointedly and directly the esta-
blishment of that order in this country—the
House of Lords. The societies not only ap-
proved of these works, but they dispervd
them all over the country, with a wondcrul
anxiety, and ata great expense. The pros-
cutors, in this case, have asked the question,
why was this done? They say it is acting
consistently, if it is done by Republicans,
who wish to subvert the monarchy, and
overturn the established orders; but, if it 8
done by dutiful subjects of the king, and per-
sons attached to the constitution of the cum
try, what explanation can they give of it? In
the defence that was made for the prisoner, it
was observed, that there were parts of these
works that went only, in general, to defend
the Rights of Man in society, without gory
to the establishments of this country; that to
such parts of these works, there could be no
reasonable objection ; and that those parts
might, therefore, be disseminated by honest
men and good subjects. Admit that the ob-
servation is fair; was it not the duty of
honest men, and good subjects, who were dis
seminating such parts of these works as mizht
serve to enlighten mankind, on subjects 00
which they ought to be enlightened, to bare
taken some pains to have separated the bad
parts from the good, or at least to have ziven
the public some caution, that, in reading
those works, they should make a separation
of themselves, that when they were read
of the general Rights of Man, and fcam
passages striking at the monarchy of thts
country, they should be careful! not to imbibe

persons who | prejudices against the monarchy? ‘That whes


reading observations on Privileged Orders,
they should take care to remember, this was
not intended to strike at the orders of this
country, to which the public had a devoted
attachment?

Such, gentlemen, would have been the con-
duct of good subjects, That this was not the
conduct of these persons is most apparent;
and that these publications must have had
the eftect of doing a great deal of mischief,
by alienating the minds of the king’s sub-
jects from his person and government, and
trom the constitution, is perfectly clear. How
much of this effect these persons intended, I
shall leave entirely fur your consideration ;
thus much I think is clear, that there is no-
thing in those publications which can serve to
remove any prejudices which arise against the
prisoner, and the persons concerned with him,

irom the addresses which was presented to
the Convention of France.

Gentlemen, another general feature in the
transactions of those men, at this peried, is
their numerous publications, complaining of
grievances supposed to exist in this country,
and the abundance of licentious observations
scattered throughout these publications, all
tending to produce the same effect—the aliena-
tion of the affections of the country from the
king and government. Grievances may and
will exist in all governments,and that they may
exist in a greater or less degree, in this govern-
ment, may be true; but dutiful and good sub-
jects, who honestly mean the reform of these
grievances, will take care, in their endeavours
to procure this reform, not to hazard the over-
turning the government itself.

These are the transactions in the early part
of the year 1793, upon which the prosecutors
rely, as manifesting a spirit of disaffection
and republicanism by which these men were
actuated, and as evidence of their having
taken measures to prepare men’s minds for
what they call a radical reform; in effect, a
change in the whole government of the coun-
try.

It appears, that in the course of the sum-
mer of that year the project of a National
Convention, to be held in Scotland, origin-
ated ; and they say, on the part of the prose-
cntion, and certainly not without colour (how
far it is distinctly proved you will judge),
that it originated with the prisoner at the bar.
‘They refer you to a letter, written by the pri-
Soner to Skirving in Edinburgh.

[See p. 407.]

Now you will hear the answer read which
Skirving sent to that letter, and you will af-
tend to it, because that answer is charged on
the part of the prosecution to have a great
deal of matter in it, tending to explain the me-
chanism of a National Convention, and also
what was to be its great object.

[Sec p. 408.]
Gentlemen, every part of this letter de-

1


serves the most serious attention, in that
view of it, which I pointed out to you just
before the reading of the letter. I think there
are some paragraphs in it which may require
to be restated to you. ‘This letter says,—‘ 1
have not a_ higher wish in the present exer-
tions for reform, than to see the people uni-
versally and regularly associated; because I
am persuaded that the present disastrous en-
gagemenis will issue in ruin, and the peo-
ple then must provide for themselves.” What
do these mysterious words mean ?—disastrous
engagements to end in ruin! If we under-
stand this to relate to any political engage-
ments into which this country had entered,
and which might end ill, the people would
not have to provide for themselves; that
would not dissuive the government. What
does he mean, therefore, when he talks of.
these disastrous engagements, which are to
issue in ruin, when the people are to provide
for themselves?

“ And it would be unhappy (says the writer
of this letter) when we should be ready to act
with unanimity, to be occupied about organi-
zation, without which, however, anarchy must
ensue.” Orgauization of what? It is true,
that if the country was to be brought to such a
state, that the government was to be destroyed
and another form of government to take its

lace, it would be unhappy when we should
= ready to act with unanimity to be occu-
pied about organization of the new powers of
government, without which anarchy must

| ensue.—Does the writer mean: this, or what

does he mean? He gues on—* We will not
need but to be prepared for the event, to
stand and see the salvation of the Lord.
Let us, therefore, take the hint given us
by our oppressors ; let us begin, in earnest,
to make up our minds relative to the extent
of reform which we ought to seek.”

The extent of reform which they ought to
seek, according to the defence was distinct,
and well known, and had been so a great
while, for it was the duke of Richmond’s plan
of reform,

He adds—* Be prepared to justify it, and
to controvert objections ; let us model the
whole in the public mind; let us provide
every stake and stay of the tabernacle which
we would erect : so that when the tabernacles
of oppression, in the palaces of ambition, are
broken down, under the madness and folly of
their supporters, we may then, without anar-
chy and all dangerous delay, erect at once our
tabernacle of righteousness, and may the Lord
himself be in it.”

What docs this mysterious man mean?
What is this tabernacle of rightcousness
to be erected at once, without anarchy
and dangerous delay? are they right on the
part of the prosecution when they say, that
he means that it is probable there may soon
be a revolution in the government of this
country, and that, in that case, it would be fit
some body of men should be ready to take

upon themselves the powers of government,
and to act upon them P or does he only mean
that a reform in parliament would be found
to be necessary; that people ought to know
what it is they mean to ask, and in what man-
ner they mean to ask it.

Gentlemen, this is an exposition of this
doctrine of a Convention coming from a Bri-
ton, and immediately communicated to
the prisoner at the bar; and, rin that re-
spect, has a direct application to him; and it
is of importance, as it tends to satisfy you that
he has not been surprised into any thing, but
that having had this communication with
Skirving on the subject, he had an opportunity
of weighing it.

There is in the evidence another exposition
of a national convention, it may be pro
that I should mention it, but I shall not state
it with great particularity, because, under the
circumstances of this case, I do not think it
ought to press much against the prisoner.—I
maean the speech of Barrére on the subject of
a national convention; in which he takes a
great deal of pains to show, that it isa thing
perfectly consistent with an established go-
vernment.—That a national convention was
the authority of the A seg at large, which
might consist with the established govern-
ments of all countries. The use that might
be made of this doctrine, by those who wished
to reconcile the people to a national conven-
tion as a constitutional measure, is apparent,
and the probable consequences of ouch a con-
vention not less apparent. And here it is fit
that I should take some notice to you of a cir-
cumstance not wholly unconnected with this
pat of the subject: It was observed to you

y the leading counsel on the part of the pri-
soner (to whom I am always desirous of pay-
ing attention), and the observation was re-
peated, that a people had a right to alter their
government. That proposition, under certain
circumstances, may be true; but it ought not
to have been introduced into a court of justice,
bound to administer the law of the existing
government, and to suffer no innovation upon
it, I did not interrupt the learned counsel
when he stated this proposition, because I did
not wish to stop him, or to disconcert the
chain of his argument; but having passed it
by upon that occasion, I feel it my duty to no-
tice it now, because it can have no relation
to the business before us, because it tends to
unsettle men’s minds, to bring on a thirst for
innovations, and to shake all the foundations
of ppemanpent,

proceed to take notice why Barrére’s ex-
position of a convention ought not to press the
risoner; it came over to this country in the
oniteur, and though it was ordered to be en-
tered in the books of the Constitutional So-
ciety, yet it does not appear that it ever was
translated into English, and therefore it was
extremely probable the prisoner never had an
opportunity of knowing Barrére’s sentiments
on that subject, But it is otherwise with re-


[sre

spect to the letter that was sent to himself; he
had a full opportunity of weighing it; of ask-
ing for explanation; or of correcting the ideas
that were in it: and it gave him warning to
take care that if such a convention was sct op
foot, it might not lead to the consequences
which seem to be pointed out in that letter.
Gentlemen, on the fifth of October of that
year the prisoner wrote a letter to Skirving, in
answer to a letter of Skirving’s dated October
the second; which last letter is not in evi
dence. In this letter the prisoner mentiuns
his having communicated to Margarot ca/y,
Skirving’s project of a convention in Scot-
land; he recommends it to Skirving to write
an official letter to his (Hardy’s) society, »
propose to them to send delegates to that con-
vention; and, in that letter, he desires Skirv-
ing vot to take notice that he had any com
Tounication with him. Here the prisoner,
Hardy, appears quite in a new character. He
was certainly not an inactive member of the
society, independent of his being secretary to
the society. Had he acted only as secretary,
it might be said, he might have been misled
in a great many things; he might have writ-
ten many things which he did not understand,
or which he had not time to weigh, as a man
might write whole sheets without having any
idea of the sense after he had written them: it
was, therefore, very much in his favour to
consider the prisoner only as a secretary. But
here he certainly is a principal, and most ex-
traordinarily so; a princi i with a
great share of the spirit of intrigue and dupli-
city, which totally changes the character of
the man, as it might have been collected
from all the rest of the evidence in the cause.
A letter is written accordingly by Skirving,
and the delegates are appointed; they were
two very able men, viz. Margarot and Gerrald.
The Scottish Convention is held. They sat
for fourteen days, and were then dispersed ty
authority. What would have happened it
that Scottish Convention had not dis-
persed, one can only conjecture ; but in order
to form any rational conjecture, it is
to attend to the general conduct of that con-
vention. It is fit you should call back to ycur
memory just the leading features of it. It is
pressed on you, on behalf of the prisoner, that
the meeting of the delegates of these bodies
was for this single object—to consider what
was the best way of appealing to parliament,
in order to procure a returm in the Commons
House of Parliament. As to that, you will
recollect the transactions of that year respect-
ing an application to parliament. There had
been an application to parliament, and the
principal mover was Mr. Grey. Of the since-
rity of the honourable mover, in his applica-
tion for a parliamentary reform, I suppose no
man will doubt; but of the sincerity of the
application of these popular societies to par
liament, on the evidence before you, every
man must doubt. They express themselves,
upon more than one occasion, as disposed to

consent to it only because it would prepare
men for what was to follow, and serve to
keep the public mind in agitation upon that
subject. Considering this convention as as-
sembled, in order to procure a reform in par-
liament, it would be fit to compare the means
with the end, and then judge whether this os-
tensible purpose was the only purpose of this
convention. :

When there was a motion made, that a
scroll ofa petition to parliament should be
prepared, they negatived it, and therefore, if
that was their only object, the aed of their
meeting was atan end; but, laying that ob-
ject aside, view this conventionas it was ; yon
find it closely imitating the manners of the
National Convention of France; you hear
of primary assemblies and sections; you per-
ceive this National Convention assuming. to
itself a formality of proceeding which is very
becoming where it is subject to no just excep-
tion, but in the place in which it appears, cer-

inly very alarming. We findthe convention
is constituted every day by solemn prayer ; it
is closed every day by solemn praver. They
had their committee of finances ; their patrio-
tic donations, with honourable mention; their
order of the day; their appellation of citizen ;
and the tenth day they assumed this
date, The first year of the British Convention :
recollect, how all this follows the poe, of
the National Convention of France. Who
shall say what would have happened if that
convention had not been dispersed at the end
of fourteen days? Whoshall say that if they

continued to assume in the manner in
which they had begun, and some interval had
been Pracied to them, and that in that time
they had happened to gain the public opinion
in their favour, judging by what happened in
France, who shall say that this body of men
‘would not have been the government of this
country? This convention was, however, dis-
persed; the consequence of which has been,
that legal proceedings have taken place against
some of the members, upon which it would
mot become me in this place to make any ob-
servations, except that occasion has been
taken to complain of these proceedings as a
grievance, and most certainly the prisoner,
and those who are connected with him in
these societies, did take occasion from thence
to irritate the public mind to as great a de-
gree as it was possible to do, by the reflections
that were made on these proceedings.

Gentlemen, there immediately followed
upon the reflections which were dispersed on
the subject ofthese proceedings, the plan of a
British Convention to be held in England ;
which leads us to the pointto which the whole
of the present inquiry is to have its relation,
-mmore or less. Now it deserves serious atten-
tion on your parts to the circumstances with
which this new plan of a convention was in-
troduced to the public notice, and by which
it was recommended to the public attention ;
in order to enable you to Tue, whether the

t



object of it was that peaceable ebject which
is insisted on for the prisoner; whether a re-
form in the Commons House of Parliament
wasreally the bottom of the whole; or whe-
ther the object of it must have been to alter
the constitution of our government, to obtain
indeed a full and perfect representation of the
prople, but not in the Commons House of

‘arliament.

One should have apprehended that under
any provocation which these people professed
to have felt, or which they might really feel,
they would have pursued a very different
course from that which they did pursue, as
they were acquainted with the circumstances
of the dispersion of the former convention,
and with all the objections that were made
to that convention. As they were determin-
ed to have another convention, it was to be
expected that, at least, they would have taken
care so to their language and proceed-
ings, that it should be impossible they could
be misunderstood ; to have expressed them-
selves clearly and distinctly on all occasions;
to have explained the grounds of this conven-
tion; to have conducted themselves with a
decent moderatiun towards the government
of the country, and towards its proceedings,
It might reasonably have been expected that
they would have made an express avowal
of loyal sentiments, and an express disa-
vowal of going any lengths which could be
justly objected to; an express disavowal of

oing beyond the original object of pe

amentary reform, as stated by the duke
of Richmond. Every thing that was inflam-
matory ought-to have been most carefully
avoided, in order to prevent their purpose be-
ing misunderstood; and what was more ma-
terial, in order to ensure success to the mea-
sure itself. What was done you will see, and
from that you will form your own conclusions.
They published a paper, which you will hear
rent. and you will attend to it. I do not con-
sider it as my business to make particular
comments on it, let it make its own impres-
sion on your minds. The paper I refer to
(there are many which are connected with it)
is the address of the 20th of January, 1794, of
the London Corresponding Society, at a gene-
ra] meeting held at the Globe-tavern.

[See page 441.]

Gentlemen, you have heard this paper read,
it expressly refers to a convention; and it was
certainly published ata time when an idea of
a convention was in the minds of the people.
Now you are to judge between the king and
the prisoner upon the evidence which this
paper affords, whether the object of that con-
vention was merely to procure a free and full
representation of the people in the Commons
House of Parliament, and in the due course of
law, and according to the constitution of the
country, or whether that paper is to be under-
stood as a manifesto to excite the people to
overturn the government, and to direct the

people's minds to the use that should be made
of a convention for the purpose of overturning
the government. :

Gentlemen, this happened on the 20th of
January, 1794; soon afterwards they began
in these two societies to consider how this
convention was to be brought about. The
London Correspunding Society had come to a
resolution upon it in terms which upon the
face of it were open to some observations. A
communication took place between the Cor-
responding Society and the Society for Con-
Stitutional Infermation. The two societies
appointed a joint committee, who came to a
resolution expressed in more guarded language,
which you will hear read.

[See page 564.]

You see that this is a dry resolution to call
@ convention for the purpose of taking into
consideration the proper method of obtaining
a fair and full representation of the people.
This is their object, as they think fit to express
themselves upon consideration; and it ¢er-
tainly was not too late for them to have re-
tracted any part of the rashness and violence
of any former measure which they might have
taken. If they, thinking they had been too
violent in their expressions, or extravagant in
their sentiments had come to this resvlution,
with a view to remedy the fault of their former
proceedings, and confine the objects of the
convention within its just limits, that con-
sideration would, no doubt, have its due
weight; but even in this resolution we find
nodeclaration that they sought only a refurm
in the Commons House of Parliament, and
that no attempt was meant against the King,
and the jurisdiction and authority of the House
of Lords.
*_ There was a joint committee of correspon-
dence and co-operation appointed by these
societies to consider of the means for carrying
this resolution into execution, and it appears
that they entered into a very extensive cor-
respondence both in England and in Scotland
for that purpose ; while that correspondence
was going on, upon the 14th of April last, the
London Corresponding Society held a general
meeting ; it seems to have been originally in-
tended to have been held in a large room in
Store-street ; it was not held there probably
from an apprehension that the magistrates
might interfere, and therefore they adjourned
to a place inthe neighbourhood of London,
Chalk-farm, They there assembled to the
number of two thousand or more, and there
the resolutions, which will be read to you
presently, were voted. These resolutions are
as violent, or more so, than the former, and do
not in the least correspond with the idea of
applying to obtain a reform of parliament on
the duke of Richmond’s plan, but seem rather
calculated to prepare the minds of the people
for a violent crisis, acrisis upon which a Na-
tional Convention once assembled would im-
mediately act, and in the nature of things


[1576

would be called upon to act; this is the pro-
secutor’s construction of these resolutions.
You will attend to them, and see whether tua
is the proper construction to be. put upoa
them—why they assembled that mecting at
all is extremely difficult to comprehend. If
they thought the former resolutions had gone
too far, and would have been liable to creat
misconstruction, and possibly might do a
great deal of mischief, it might be necessary
to call another meeting for the purpose of cor-
recting what was extravagant in these reso-
lutions, and of bringing back things toa more
moderate tone ; to point out more disunctly
the lawful objects they had in view, and w-
tally to exclude all idea of their going beyond
those objects. Tobe sure such a meeting, in
their circumstances, might have been vers
proper ; but if it should appear that this se-
cond meeting was pursuing the same idea, and
giving a great deal of countenance to what
was done at the former meeting, that the as
sembling of two thousand people must bave
an effect to impress the public mind, that a
force was ready to act when called upon, and
they were determined to go on with that,
which on the 20th of January they had pro-
mulgated to the world, If instead of intend-
ing to bring things back, or to remedy the ef-
fects of their foriner violence, we tind them
advancing in the same carecr, and hastemag
by the same means to the accomplishasx at ot
their object, what must be the conclusiun? If
instead of coming forward with a declaration
of their loyalty to the throne, or their attacb-
ment to the constitution of parliament, as far
as respects the House of Lords, in order to do
away the impression of their former proceed-
ings, and remove all suspicion and ambiguity
with respect to their future intentions, we find
them coming forward with another minitesto;
this manifesto comes forward in a still more
questionable shape than the former, as it car-
nies along with it the appearance of great
force, and may be understood to notfy that
they are ready, if it shall be necessary, to sct
in support of their former resolutions. You
will fr these resolutions of Chalk-farm
read,and you will form your own judgment
on them.

[See p p. 735, 738.]

Gentlemen, one cannot hear this paper
read, without feeling astonishment that men
could be so blinded by enthusiasm, or by any
other affection of the human mind, as not to
see that in consequence of such a publication
ag this, independent of its particular applica
tion lo the subject of our present inquiry, the
sword of the law was hanging over their heads
by a single thread. They ap; to have
linaeticd that the meeting of a conventwa
could not be prevented but by act of parla
ment. Suppose it was possible for them %
have believed that, and suppose the publicity
of their proceedings to afford some argument
that these men thought them legal, was ¥

possible, if they attended to the subject, or if
they had taken any advice, not to see that it
‘was extremely criminal to publish those reso-
lutions to two hundred thousand people? and
as many more as might have an opportunity
of looking atthem. According to these reso-
Jutions, it was a probable case “ that they
would soon be in a state where the social
compact would be actually dissolved, and that
it-would be necessary to appeal to that prin-
ciple, that incontrovertible maxim of eternal
justice, that the safety of the people was the
supreme, and in cases of necessity, the only
law,” which admits but of one interpretation.
If the social compact is dissolved, there is an
end of the government, of course there must
be the establishment of another in its stead ;
another government must be framed ; this is
therefore expressly encouraging the people
to look out for the moment to arrive when
another government was to be framed, to be
erected on the ruins of the present establish-
ment.

Gentlemen, it is of importance, with respect
to the present question, that the eighth and
tenth resolutions glance, not in an indirect
manner, at the House of Lords, as a body in
the contitution, not entitled to the respect of
the people. Of what extreme consequence
this was in the present moment you will see,
because this was the moment in which, that
which was to be done in the National Conven-
tion, was to occupy the minds of all people.
And what was to 4 done? They say on the
part of the prisoner, that he, and those who
were associated with him, were in a dutiful,
constitutional, and regular course, to collect

sense of all people, and then present the
united wishes of the peuple, in a regular and
constitutional way, to parliament. Now was
that, or could that be the object of men who
had assumed so much of the republican cha-
racter, who afler addressing the National
Convention of France, had acted the part they

done, up to the present moment, who
were then talking of the social compact being
dissolved, and were then speaking contemp-
tuously of the other branch of the legislature.

To this question, what was meant to be
done in this convention, as resolved on, in
January, 1792,and as followed up by the reso-
lutions at Chalk-farm, on the 14th of April,
belongs a transaction of a society at Sheffield,
which has been a leading society in corres-
pondence with the two societies here in Lon-
don. ‘The society at Sheffield, had been arti-
ficially represented to be extremely numerous;
there was a meeting, in fact, of ten thousand,
on the 7th of April, on the Castle-hill, Seve-
ral resolutions were there passed ; they were
moved by a Mr. Yorke, not a native of that
place, but who found his way among them,
and made use of that opportunity. You have
heard of Mr. Yorke being a member of the
London Corresponding Society—under what
directions he went to Sheffield, does not ap-
pear; how these resolutions were obtained, I



do not think it material to observe upon, far-
ther than that it isa satisfaction to know; that
though multitudes are made parties to these
proceedings, there is every reason in the world
to belive, that but few are engaged in the
depth of the project. Of the ‘ten* thousand
people assembled on the Castle-hill, there is
no reason to suppose that two hundred knew
what was going forward. A trick for negativ-
ing a resolution to petition parliament, was
concerted between four people, and by their
mancuvring, and management, these resolu-
tions passed in such a way, that it was impos.
sible they could be understood by the greatest
part of the people; but however that was, the
promulgation of them to the world at this
juncture, appears tu have avery close con-
nexion with this plan of aconvention. It was
Proposed, and resolved, to petition parliament
no more. It was observed by. the counsel for
the prisoner, that oe cannot justly conclude,
because an individual society, or those who
conducted that society were of opinion that
they should petition parliament no more, that
therefore a body of men, more likely to com-
mand the attention of parliament, were not,
according to their apprehension to apply to
parliament, fora parliamentary reform.

It was fairly put, and it is right and fit to
see whether the observation is founded in
the truth of the case. When you come to ex-
amine the resolution with the context, it hardly
admits of that interpretation, because the rea-
son they assign for not petitioning is, that
they will not petition a body who are not their
representatives. Now that reason must apply
to the House of Commons for ever, accordin,
to their notion of it, and as it was underst
and adopted, by the Corresponding Society,
and other societies with whom they were in
correspondence. If it could not be the object of
this convention to petition parliament, where
shall we find the pie. but in the addresses
to the nation immediately preceding and
immediately following the promulgation
of the project, which appear totally incon-
sistent with the idea of a convention for
the purpose of an application to parliament,
and to be consistent with, and calculated to
give effect to aconvention for other purposes,
and particularly for the purpose of concerting
the means of establishing a representative go-
vernment of the people?—There is a piece of
parol evidence, which respects this point fit
to be stated—Lynam says, that at one of their
meetings, Bell observed that their address to
the National Convention in France, proved
that they meant to introduce their laws here
to which Mr. Margarot said, no doubt. The
other persons present said nothing, Hardy was
present and this passed at a mceting of the
delegates; if therefore he had no doubt, and
if the nature of the transactions countenances
that opinion, and if the transactions taken to-
gether should be irreconcileable to the other
opinion, then there is a weighty evidence for
your consideration, to prove the whole extent

47

of the proposition as it is stated on the part
of the prosecution.

The parol evidenceapplies both ways, many
of the witnesses for the crown expressly
disavow all force upon the government, and
évery othér object beyond a reform in the
€ommons House of Parliament; on the other
hand, individuals are charged with having
attempted to corrunt the soldiery, and to have
meditated a personal attack upon the king,
and direct force against his government ; but
this, however, I ought to observe, is not
brought home to the prisoner. There is also
parol evidence, though loose and unconmected,
of a preparation of arms in which the pri-
soner is in some degree implicated. One
witness, not of the best credit, said that they
were to furnish themselves with arms to
defend the National Convention when it
should be called. This evidence in its nature
is very important—this is clear, that in their
idea of a national convention, every thing was
therein to be conducted peaceably, and orderly,
the national convention must then be pro-
tected from without, because it is by such a
national convention being protected, and
being left at liberty to act, that it could exe-
eute its orders and decrees; it seems, there-
fore, not imconsistent with the idea of a
national convention which was to overturn
the government, to inculcate peace, and good
order; for the truth undoubtedly was, and
these persons saw it, that whatever this
national convention was to do, it must do by
means of having the voice of the public going
along with it. It was in that way only, that
it could execute its purposes; the taking arms,
therefore, to defend the national convention,
has an immediate connexion with the charge.
In the parol evidence it was also stated, that
these people expected there would be a
struggle before they obtained their object, and
that they had made a preparation for it;
several witnesses said, that their whole object,
in furnishing themselves with arms was, to
defend themselves against illegal attacks, and
negatively, that they did not mean to attack
the king, or the government. If they had no
object Bavond pure self-defence, they might
lawfully furnish themselves with arms.

If they meant to put themselves into a con-
dition to sustain their convention by force,
against any attack which might be made
upon it, or upon them in defence of it,
«defence becomes offence and treason.

Respecting the whole of this evidence as to |

arms, standing alone, I should have thought
No great reliance was to be had upon it; con-
nected, as it is, with the whole transactions
of these bodies, it certainly is evidence very
fit to be taken into consideration by the jury,


and is of some use towarcs marking what was -
in the minds of the people at the time they |
lished in the name of the duke of Richmond—

Proposed this conven'ion, and whether their
purpose was that which this prosecution

charges—a purpose of subverting the govern- | €
ment of the country, consequently deposing | cerned in this particular measure of a conven-

(120

the king, which is an overt ‘act of compatsmp
the king’s death.

Gentlemen, I have extracted from the evi-
dence such parts of it, as appear to me mate-
tially to bear upon the charge, in order that
you may be able to take a distinct view of it,
and to judge for yourselves, whether or not
they justify the charge to the extent in which
it is laid.

But, before you come to that consideration,
you are to attend, and to attend with favour,
to every thing that can be urged on the part
of A prisoner. " oe

entlemen, on the part le prisoner, he
part of the written Tiience has been cx-
troverted: it-could not well be controverted,
I do not think it has been very weightily urged
that the prisoner did not take such an active
share in these transactions, as te make ban,
not only in strictness of law, a principal, bat,
to the satisfaction of every man’s mind, 3
Principal in the whole of them. He was net
only secretary to one of these societies, but a
member of both, and an active member, and,
in one or two instances, si ly active.
He was the promoter, designer, and inventor
of some of the measures, with some degree of
mancuvring and management; and there
fore I did not think it necessary to trouble
you with separately stating the particular evi-
dence which affects him.

Gentlemen, they have made several fair
and weighty observations on the credit and
materiality of the parol testimony, in respect
of the situation of the witnesses, many of
them introducing themselves into these socie-
ties, for the purpose of erring saturation af
what was passing there, antl also in respect of
the subject matter of the testimony itvelf,
particularly that of arming, as having so
necessary connexion with this plan of a con-
vention, which had been projected; sad I
think there is a great deal of weight in thet
observation; and if it depended entirely upon
the circumstance of the arms, to manifest the
purpose of a convention, I should stste to
you, that, though it was a case of pret sus-
picion, yet that it hardly went to t!
to fix on the convention a wicked purpose of
that extraordinary extent which the proseca-
tion has imputed to it, upon all the grounds of
evidence, taken together, which the case
furnishes.

Gentlemen, they state the case of the pri-
soner thus :—That he isa plain man, of
simplicity of manners, peaceable and orderly
in his deportment, and a friend to the consti-
tution of his country; having one great
political object in his mind, namely, the
obtaining a radical reform in the Commoss
House oF Parliament, by the introduction of
universal suffrage and annual elections—Thet
he had taken this object from a plan pub-

They say, this has been the sole object ofall his
measures ; and that, as faras he has been cue

tion, his ideas on that subject were taken from
that book; and there is certainly a very plain
allusion in that book, to the people meeting
together for the purpose of considering of the
means to execute such parliamentary reform ;
that he had an expectation, highly encouraged
by the language of that book, that the united
sense of a great number of people by their
delegates in convention, expressed to parlia-
ment, might perhaps have better success than
petitions from individuals, whether they were
considered as individual men, or as individual
societies of men.

They farther insist for the prisoner, that
here is to be found no proof of a design to use
this convention to any other purpose; and
that, as to the horrible purpose of subverting
the government, they say, it is not only not
proved, but, in the nature of the thing, is
improbable, and even impossible, considering
how disproportioned the means are to the
' end—That, if it is to be considered as a pro-

Convention at Edinburgh, it ought not to be
held to be treasonable, because that was
' treated as a misdemeanor only—They say,
whatever violence there may be in the lan-
' guage of the resolutions, addresses, and other
‘papers to which the prisoner has been privy,
| there is in them no demonstration of the
treasonable designs now imputed to him,
They appeal to the testimony of a great
: umber of members of the different societies
with whom he has been connected, for the
soundness of their principles, and of his own;
! their dutiful attachment to the king, and their
reverence for the constitution of parliament,
' and for the Lord’s House of Parliament, as a
branch of it.
: And the prisoner also appeals to the cha-
racter given of him by acloud of respectable
witnesses, who represent him as a peaceable,
sedate, religious and moral man, aving as
many of them collect from his conversation,
* this one object a reform of parliament; and,
as @ particular manifestation of the conscious
; Annocence of his conduct, they refer you toa
proposition which he made to Mr. Sheridan,

when that gentleman proposed to bring the |

proceedings of these societies before parlia-
ment, in the spring of the year 1793 :—the
prisoner offered to show him his books,
papers, and, in short, all his correspondence,

that had any relation to the subject, and was }

ready to lay them before parliaient.—He is
also represented by Mr. Francis, as appearing
to him to be deeply engaged in this business
of a parliamentary reform, and sincerely desi-
rous of obtaining it, in the regular course, by
petition to the tlouse of Commons; and it ap-
pears that he hroughta petition to Mr. Francis,
as from the society to which he belonged, to
be by him presented to parliament.—This was
m May, 1793.—The petition, I should add,
was on the plan of the duke of Richmond;
and it may be true, that this plan may have
received countenance from the protest which


has been read to you from the Lord’s Journals,
made by a great number of the lords in par-
liament, and containing sentiments which, if
you suppose it to have fallen into the hands
of inferior men, who happen to be eager
enthusiasts, certainly might have great weight
with them.—But, gentlemen, you will observe
what the duke of Richmond’s plan and the
protest go to; if a question were to arise,
whether, in a clear case of a project, strictly
according to the duke of Richmond’s plan,
and strictly according to the protest, any
crime could be fastened upon the assembling
a convention for the purpose of promoting the
Project, these sentiments would have their

| weight :—Here the application fails ; nobody.
| can suppose that eit

| mond’s plan, or the language of the protest,
| goes in the smallest degree to countenance a
| convention for the purpose of introducing a

er the duke of Rich-

democracy into the country, which is the

| purpose now imputed to this prisoner.
ceeding of the same nature with the British }

T have already given it as my opinion, thag
it ought to be conceded to the prisoner, that
really, and truly, when he set out in this bu«
siness, he was sincerely attached to that re+
form, as expressed in the duke of Richmond’s
plan; and probably, at that time, he had no
idea of going beyond it; but the question
now befure you is, whether he has not gone
very far indeed beyond it.

Mr. Solicitor General, in his reply, bas im-
peached some of the testimony that has been
given for the prisoner, by implicating the
witnesses belonging to some of these sacie-
ties, in the violent measures which were
adopted by these societies, and the Sheffield
Socicty in particular, whose duplicity in their
correspondence with the Constitutional So-
ciety, and the Society of the Friends of the
Peuple, of which I have already taken notice,
is open to a great deal of observation.
Though men declare upon theiroaths that they
are peaceable and orderly, and sincerely at-
tached to the constitution of the country, and
to their king, yet, if they are found to be en
gaged in measures which imply directly the,
contrary, it does go very strongly to the cre-
dit of their testimony; for, in that case,
their testimony is “ Protestatio contra fac-
tum.”

Gentlemen, in the reply to that part of the
evidence given by Mr. Francis, where he
said the prisoner appeared to him to be per-
fectly sincere, it was observed, all this ap-
pears hy the evidence to have been mere pre-
tence and pvlicy to carry on the general
plan; the reply also observes on the evidence
to his character, that though he has establish-
ed by a cloud of witnesses, and in the most
satisfactory manner, that he is in his private
character a sedate, moral, religious, good
man, yet that his conduct in all these transac-
tions strongly marks, that he is so deeply
tinctured with enthusiasm that his moral
character may be but a neutral circumstance.
The counsel in reply mentioned the famous

\

case, when enthusiasm worked up to the ut-
mostheight produced the fifth Monarchy Men
aud that in their case the treason grew out of
their religion, .

They say on the part of the prosccution,
that the acts done by this man, as they appear
from all the evidence, are totally inconsis-
tent with the professions he has ‘made and
the opinions he says he has entertained,
namely, that his real object was only a reform
in the Commons House of Parliament.

Gentlemen, upon the whole of this state-
ment of the charge, the defence and reply
and upon the whule course of evidence before
you, you have now to exercise your judg-
ments. I desire, that in exercising your
judgments you will pay no more attention
to any thing I have said than that which is
necessary to lead you to the consideration of
those points which seem immediately to con-
stitute the particular charge against this man,
and to the evidence by which it is sup-
ponte to those points, and to that evidence

y which the defence may be supported, and
to the answer given to that defence. Every
verdict ought to be the jury’s own and ought
to proceed on clear grounds of fact—It
ought to do so in a case of this nature more
particularly, if possible, because one great
object of this prosecution must be that the
country ma.
that the public justice of it has taken its fair
course, and that you, the jury, have well and
truly tried and true deliverance made between
the gd and the prisoner at the bar, accord-
ing to the law of the land and the oath which
you have taken.

Iam very sorry to have occasion to remark,
that during the course of this trial the dignity
of a court of justice has but too often been vio-
lated by improper behaviour both within and
without doors; what it is men can mean by
such conduct who do not wish at once to dis-
solve all government and the bonds of all so-
ciety, I cannot imagine.—I trust I shall hear
no more of this.—You will now withdraw,
gentlemen, and consider of your verdict.

One of the Jury.—My lord, we wish to have

a copy of the indictment to take out with us.

Lord Chief Justice Eyre.—I suppose there
will be no objection to your taking out the
indictment; it is not strictly lar, but I
dare say it will be consented to on both sides.

Gentlemen, I must apprize you, that after
you have withdrawn there can be no refresh
ment given to you.—Do you wish to take
any moderate refreshment before you with
draw?

One of the Jury.—My lord, we thank you,
we shall not have occasion for any.

[The Jury withdrew at thirty minutes after
twelve o’clock at noon, and they returned
again into Court at thirty-five minutes afer
three o’clock.]

Thomas Hardy set to the bar.

Clerk of the Arraigns.—Thomas Hardy, ho'd
up your hand—Gentlemen of the jury, look
upon the prisoner—How say, you, 1s Thoms
Hardy guilty of the high treason whereof be
stands indicted, or not guilty?

Foreman.—Not Guilty.

Clerk of Arraigns.—Did he fly for it ?

Foreman.—Not that we know of.

Prisoner.—My fellow countrymen I return
you my thanks.

[The prisoner was immediately discharged.]

Lord Chief Justice Eyre——Gentlemen of
the Jury; I ought to take the firstopportunity,
after this laborious attendance, very sincerely
to thank you for the readiness with which
you have sacrificed so much of your personal
convenience, and with which you have under-
gone the fatigue of this trial.*

TO VOLUME XXIV.

TO HARDY’S CASE;

P. 211, 1.2. Note to the words “ October
the sixth.”

Hardy, the preliminary proceedings from
the sixth to the twenty-seventh of October
inclusive, are detailed at much greater
length than in the text. The following is
Sibly’s account :

Session-House, Clerkenwell—Monday, Oct. 6.

The Court met at ten o’clock, when the
grand jury bad not a bill ready to return.
About two o’clock the Lord Chief Baron ap-
peared on the bench, when a true bill was re-
turned against the following persons for high
treason :

Thomas Hardy,
John Horne Tooke,
Jn. Augustus Bonney,

Thomas Holcroft,
John Richter,
Matthew Moore,

Stewart Kydd, John Thelwall,
Jeremiah Joyce, Richard Hodgson, and
William Wardle, John Baxter.

The bill against John Lovett was not
found.

The jury thanked the chief justice for the
charge delivered to them the day on which
the commission opened, which, at their re-

uest, was ordered to be printed. The judge
thanked them in return for the compliment.
As he would not affect to say that he deli-
vered it without notes, he would chearfully
acquiesce in their request. His lordship ob-
served, that the jury had attended four days,
and wished to know if they should proceed
any farther that day? or if they meant to ad-
journ? After this conversation, they agreed
to adjourn to next day at ten o’clock.

The Attorney-General made the usual mo-
tions, that copies of the indictments be given
to the prisoners.

The Chief Justice wished to know of the
attorney-general, what time he would be in
readiness to deliver to the prisoners the panel
of the jury, &c. as ten days were required be-
fore the trials could commence.

The Attorney-General said, he should be
able to answer, and settle the business next

lay. ;
The Chief Justice next called upon the per-
sons who attended as agents, solicitors, and

a
others for the prisoners, and informed them,
that by the usual application they may have
access to the prisoners. He said, he would
not harass the prisoners by having them
brought up until their arraignment—to inform
them of these particulars, for that copies of
their indictments should be left with them,
and wished this information might be imme-
diately communicated.—And then the Court
adjourned,

Session House, Clerkenwell, Tuesday, Oct. 7th.

The Grand Jury being called, presented a
true bill against John Martin, for high treason.

The Chief Justice asked if there were any
more bills ready for the grand jury.

The Foreman said, the jury would be glad
to adjourn to some day, when there might be
Busitieas sufficient to engage them the whole

jay.

Mr. White, one of the solicitors to the trea-
sury, said, if the Court was adjourned till
Thursday, he thought they should be ready
with all the bills that were meant to be pre-
sented, if that day would be convenient for
the jury.

_ The Foreman said, the jury had no objec-
tion.

The Chief Justice said, he had no objection,
after the business of this day was over, to ad-
journ the court to Thursday, at 10 o'clock.

At this moment appeared in court Mr. Hol-
croft, who addressed the court to the follow-
ing efiect:

“ My Lord; —“ Being informed that
a bill for high treason has been preter-
-red against me, Thomas Holcroft, by his
majesty’s attorney-general, and returned
a true bill by a grand jury of these realms,
I come to surrender immysclf to this court,
and my country, to be put upon my trial;
that, if I am a guilty man, the whole ex-

Addendum to [1400

tent of my guilt may become notorious;
and, if innocent, that the rectitude of my
principles, and conduct may be no less public.
And I hope, my lord, there is no appearance
of vaunting in assuring your lordship, this
Court, and my country, that, after the mistor-
tune of having been suspected as an enemy to
the peace and happiness of mankind, there ts
nothing on earth, after which, as an indivi-
dual, I more ardently aspire than a full, far,
and public examination.

“J have further to request that your ford
ship will inform me, if it be not the practice,
in these cases, to assign counsel, and to suger
the accused to speak in his own detens?
Likewise, whether free egress and regress
not allowed for such persons, buoks, ard
papers, as the accused, or his counsel, shall
deem necessary for justification ?”

Chief Justice —“ With regard to the first,
Sir, it will be the duty of the Court to ass:
you counsel, and also to order that such cuun-
sel shall have free access to you at all proper
hours—with respect, Sir, to the liberty of
speaking for yourself, the accused will te
fully heard by himself, as well as by his coun
sel; but with regard to papers, books, and
other things of that kind, it is impossible for
me to say any thing precisely, with regard to
them, until the thing required be asked.
However, Sir, you may depend upon it, every
thing will be granted to the party accused, se
as to enable him to make his defence. If I
understand you rightly, you now admit that
you are the person standing indicted by the
name of ‘Thomas Holcroft?”

Mr. Holcroft.—* Yes, my lord.”

Chief Justice —“ You come here to surren-
der yourself, and I can only accept of that sur-
render on the supposition that you are the
person so indicted. You know the conse-
eerie Sir, of being indicted of high treasen.

shall be under the necessity of ordering you
into custody. I would not wish to take any
advantage of your coming forward in person,
indiscreetly, in this manner, without be.ng
called upon by the ordinary process of tbe
law. You should have a moment to conser
whether you surrender yourself as that per-
son.”

Mr. Holcroft.—“ It is certainly not my
wish, either to inflict upon myself unneces-
sary punishment, or to appear to put myself
forward on this occasion. I come only as
‘¥homas Holcroft, of Newman-street, in the
county of Middlesex, and I certainly do net
wish to stand more forward, than any other
man ought to stand.”

Chief Justice-—“ IT cannot enter into this
point. If you admit yourselt'to be the persoa
Indicted, the consequence must be, that I
must order you to be taken into custody to
answer this charge. Ido not know whetner
you are, or are not, Thomas Holcroft. I cs
not know you, and therefore it is imposscle
forme to know whether yap are the persou
stated in the indictment.”

beeen =
 1401) Hardy's Case.

Mr. Holcroft.— It is equally impossible
for me, my lord.”

Chief Justice —“ Why then, Sir, I think
you had better sit still——IJs there any thing
moved on the part of the crgwo with respect
to this gentleman?”

Solicitor General.—* My lord, as I consider
him to be the person against whom a true
bill is found, I move that he be committed.”

Chief Justice. —“ I do not know how many
persons there may be of the name of Thomas
Holcrutt; it would be rather extraordinary to

“commit a person on this charge, if we do not
know him.”

Mr. Knapp, one of the counsel for the
crown, contended, that from what the pri-
soner had said at first in court, he admitted
himself to be the person.”

Chief Justice.—“ That does not signify.
Does the counsel for the crown think fit that
this gentleman should be committed ?”

Solicitor General.—“ 1 move that he now
be taken into custody.” *

Chief Justice.—“ Sir, you must now stand
committed.”.

A sheriff's officer now took Mr. Holcroft
into custody.

Chief Justice to the prisoner.— Are you
prepared to name your counsel ?”

His solicitor immediately named Mr. Ers-
kine and Mr. Gibbs, whom the court assigned
in the usual form.

The same learned advocates were named
for Mr Thelwall and Mr. Baxter.

John Pearce stated to the Court, that he
was an articled clerk to Mr. Martin against
whom the grand jury had found a bill) He
requested that he might be permitted to at-
tend Mr. Martin, as, without his assistance,
he did not think Mr. Martin would be able to
proceed to his trial.

The Solicitor General objected to this ap-
plication, because there might be a charge
against Mr. Pearce himself.

The Judge observed, that until some
charge was preferred, he could not refuse this
application.

Mr. White, the solicitor, desired that the
order might be postponed until Friday, which
the judge consented to, on condition that a
copy of the indictment was not preferred till
that time. The chief justice then ordered the
officer to adjourn the Court.

Mr. Holcroft begged that his servant might
be permitted to have access to him.

The Chief Justice said, that was a sort of
thing that was quite new, and he did not
know that he could grant it, unless some-
thing was stated by Mr. Holcroft, with res-
pect to his health, to make it requisite.

Mr. Holcroft said, there was nothing of
that sort; that he did not know it to be un-
usual, or he should not have asked it. The
reason for his asking it, was, that his servant
was his amanuensis ;_ it had been his habit to
dictate to this man, and therefore it would be

“extremely convenient for him to be indulged


‘in this particular, if that wes not contrary to
custom.

The Chief Justice said, he was afraid it was,
and he thought it would be proper for Mr.
Holcroft to: apply to another quarter, which
could better grant indulgence than he could
sitting in that court.

Mr. Holcroft said, he wished to have no in-
dulgence ; he only wished for justice.

The Chief Justice said, “ Then, Sir, I can-
not make the order.”

The Court then immediately adjourned to
Thursday, at ten o’clock in the morning.

[The preceding account being that which ap-
peared in the public prints, there appeared
next day, in the same prints, the following
note from Mr. Holcroft.]

To the Eprror, &c. x

Sir ;—The predicament in which I stand is,
I presume a self-evi‘lent motive, why I should
be assidiously careful that the following
mistake, in your account of what passed yes-
terday at Hicks’s-hall, should be corrected.
You state, that, when asked by the chief jus-
tice whether I admitted myself to be the per-
son indicted by the name of Thomas Hol-
croft, I answered, “ Yes, my lord ;” far from
answering in this direct manner, the question
immediately awakened in me sone apprehen-
sion of having too implicitly credited the re-
ports I heard, from persons of various rank
and station, that a bill for high treason was
found against me; the purport of my answer
to his Tordship immediately was, that the
only knowledge I had of the event was that
which I derived from these reports. Such an
answer as you have been intormed I made,
might very innocently have escaped a very
innocent man, though the truth is, it did not
happen to escape me. It might perhaps too
very innocently, but mistakenly, have im-
plied, in the minds of some people, a consci-
ousness of my having deserved to be indicted ;
an innuendo which, from my heart and soul,
and with all the faculties I possess, of mind

memory, and truth, I repel.

Newgate, October 8, 1794.

Session House, Clerkenwell, Thursday, Oct. 9th.

The Court met again at ten o’clock, when
the grand jury presented a true bill for high
treason against John Hillier.

Another bill was then preferred by Mr.
White, solicitor of the treasury. With this
bill the jury retired to their own room; after
which the Court adjourned to Thursday, the
sixteenth of October.

Session- House, Clerkenwell, Thursday, Oct. 16th.

The Court sat as before. The grand jury
returned a true bill against John Piilip
Franklow for high treason.

Mr. White, solicitor of the treasury, then
preferred two other bills to the jury.

The Chief Justice observed, he should wish
to adjourn the Court for the accommodation of
the jury, and he thought Tuesday next might
be a proper day; in the mean time the jury
woul proceed on the bills now before them.
His lordship said, he hoped on Tuesday to
discharge the jury from a very long and la-
borious service; at least until further sum-
mons. His lordship asked if there was any
motion to be made ? To which, there heing no
answer, the court adjourned to Tuesday, the
‘lst of October.

Tuesday, October 21st.

A bill against John Ashley, for the same
crime was not found.

Adjourned to Saturday the 25th of October.

{At eight o’clock on Friday morning, the
24th of October, the prisoners, who were con-

guarded by constables, &c. but no military,
to Newgate.]

nard, Shoreditch, in the county of Middleser,

aforesaid, labourer.

The Court, immediately on their appes:-
ance, wished to know, whether the prisupery’
counsel attended in pursuance to their nomi.
nation and appointment?

Mr. Gurney replied, that in addition to bis
learned friends present, who had been r-
tained, be expected Mr. Erskine, Mr. Gibts,
and Mr. F. Vaughan, who bad been nomi
nated by the Court.

The Court condescended to wait a few nsi-
nutes.

The windows which are behind the bay,
where the prisoners were, having been pre-
viously let down by the Lord President's
ders, so as to admit a strong current of az,
the following observations were made by

Mr. Horne Tooke.—* My lord, I beg kare
to represent to the Court, that we have jas
come out of a very confined and close bole,
and the windows now opened at our hacks,
expose us to so much cold air, that our bealth,
particularly my own, will be considerably es-
dangered, and most probably we shall los
our voices betore we leave the place. I shali,
therefore, request of the Court to be dis
missed as soon as their convenience wil
permit.”

The Lord President of the Commission —
“ Tf you are pre| to plead, sir, you my
be dismissed almost immediately. We were
waiting for your counsel, that you might have
the benefit of their assistance.”

Mr. H. Tooke.—“ My lord, in a great mes
sure am I prevented from being now able »
say any thing on the subject of the indit-
ment, from the circumstance of our not having
had the ten clear days allowed by act of par-
liament, to persons in our situation. By the
change of custody a whole day has been com-
pletely lost to us; in consequence, we have
not bad an opportunity of conversing with
our counsel. Mr. Erskine and Mr. Gibbs
had engaged themselves to dine with me os
Friday, for the purpose of conferring together
on the business of this day. Notice was
given me as late as nine or ten on Thursdsy
night only, of my intended removal; 1 was
removed by eight o’clock the next morning:
it was perfectly impossible for me, therefore,
to take the advantage of my counsel's advice,
as our arrangements were thus compl
destroyed, and all my papers, which I
collected and arranged in the Tower, throws
into disorder and confusion. Your lurdship—
who never was a prisoner—can have bata
very imperfect idea of the change of am

tody.”

The Lord President.—“ The Court is ix
clined to make every allowance that can be
expected, and is willing to wait the arrivals!
your counsel.”

Mr. Tooke.—“ Rather than catch cold, I
should choose to plead at present. I ask 20
indulgence, but desire substantial justice.

| When I mentioned the circumstance of the
 1405) Hardy's Case.

day’s loss, I did not, by any means, wish to
cause delay. It is undoubtedly clear, that
the act, which says, that not /ess than ten
days should be allowed, by no means meant
to preclude the accused from having the
advantage of more than ten days, if neces-
sary for the preparation of materials requisite
for their defence. I hope that no inconve-
aience will arise to us from the shifting of
custody :—but we certainly have not had the
indulgence which that law intended us. I
am, however, ready to plead, Sous deprived
of the advantage of my papers, and the bene-
fit of advice. We have been six months in

Mr. Thelwatl—“ My lord, I think it my
duty, and an act of justice to myself and my
country, to mention, in this public manner,

the hardships which we have suffered. Not
to mention the loss of a day, I myself have
to complain of a circumstance very detri-
mental indeed to me. I have been deprived
of the benefit of my books and papers, which
I had collected together, and arranged in the
Tower. When we were removed from the
Tower, the sheriffs thought proper not to al-
low me time sufficient to take them with
me; I do not mean to attach any blame to
them, when I mention this, for with great
politeness they promised I should have them
sent me. Afterwards, when I had an oppor-
tunity of sending for them through the me-
dium of a friend who was sending to the
Tower for some things he wanted, I was re-
fused, and received an evasive answer. I
was informed, that they could not send what
I wanted, as I had a number of other things
there, and they must be sent for together, as
it would be necessary to have a separate coach
for them. This morning I received a second
evasive answer. I mention this circumstance
pot with any view of delay, for I am as
aaxious, as any man can be for any thing, to
meet the justice of my country.”

The indictment was then read by the clerk
of the Arraigns.

The prisoners were then severally asked the
usual questions, “ Guilty or not guilty ?”—
6¢ How will you be tried 2”

Mr. Hardy.— Not guilty..—“ By God
end my country.”

Mr. Tooke.—“ Not guilty.” On being ask-
ed how he would be tried, he eyed the Court
for some seconds with an air of significancy,
which few men are so well able to assume,
and, shaking his head, emphatically answered
—** Iwoutn be tried by God and my country.
But ”»

The others answered in the usual manner—
« Not guilty”—By God and my country.”

Mr. Bonney was about to make some re-
smmarks, when he was interrupted by

The Lord President, — Tooke haying com-

§

plained ‘of the coldness of the air, may with<
draw.” .

Mr. Tooke then withdrew.

_ John Auguitus Bonney. My lord, there
is an error in this indictment, which entitles
me to plead in abatement. I am described
late of the parish of 8%. Giles in the Fields,
whereas I ph t to have been described of
the parish of St. Pancras, I never did reside
in the parish of St. Giles. But, my lord, I
am also c by this indictment with hav-
ing committed treason in the parish of St.
Giles; and as my description is just as true
and correct as this assertion, lam content
to take my trial upon the indictment in its
present form; for I look forward with earnest
and anxious expectation for the day when a
jury of my country shall justify me from the
aliases thrown on my character by this
indictment: I therefore wave my objection,
and plead generally, that I am not guilty.”
Mr. Thelwall— There is a circumstance,
thy lord, which my counsel have info:
me would entirely quash this indictment as

far as s me, if I were inclined to take
advantage of it. My description is notright ¢
I am described as an inhabitant of West-

minster, whereas I reside in the Liberties of
the Duchy of Lancaster, Anxious as I atm
to have conduct examined into by m:
country, [despine the idea of availing myse!
of any paltry subterfuge. I feel perfectly con-
vinced, that when the long expected day shall
come, no honest jury can say otherwise than
I do now,—Not guilty.”

Mr. Bonney then said, “I beg that your
lordships will allow me a few words before
we quit the bar. I assure you, if I had been
arraigned for any known and certain treason,
for murder, or for felony, I would ask no fa-
vour of your lordships; but when 1 stand be-
fore you upon a case, in which (and I believe
I have your lordships’ opinion in my favour
on the subject) if the facts charged st
us should be proved, there would still be very
great duubt upon the law, I trust I do not
make an improper request when I solicit your
lordships, that we may be allowed as man’
of the little comforts and conveniences of lite
(to which we have been accustomed) as may
be consistent with the security of our persons.
Your lordships, I am sure, will agree with me,
that a situation in which a man can neither
sleep by night, nor cast his eye on a ray of
comfort by day, is not much adapted to pre-
pare his mind for so important a trial as
mine—and yet, my lords, such is my situa-
tion.

“ I beg to be understood not to intend the
smallest insinuation against the sheriffs; their
language and their countenances, when they
visited me yesterday in my cell, sufficiently
convinced me of the concern they felt at not
being able to afford me better accommodation.
My request, therefore, to your lonsieigs is,
that we may be remanded to the custody of
the governor of the Tower, where we have

been treated, for two and twenty weeks, with
the greatest humanity and attention.”

Mr. Richter and Mr. Barter also complained
of the want of accommodation in the places
where they were confined.

The Lord President.—“ I must repeat, that
the Court can only reter you to the discretion
and humanity of the sheriffs, who have al-
ready undertaken to pay attention to your
complaints.”

Mr. Attorney General.— My lord, as the
prisoners have signified their desire to be tried
separately, I move that Mr. Hardy be tried
first; and that the warrants, made necessary
by 4 late act of parliament, for constituting
the commission, be recorded.”

Mr. Erskine, who, together with Mr. Gibbs
and Mr. Vaughan, counsel for the prisoners,
had come into court during the reading of the
indictment by the clerk of the crown, apolo-
gized to the Court for their momentary ab-
sence, as not expecting the business of the
Court to begin so early. He understood that
Mr. Horne Tooke had stated, and truly, to
the Court, the total want of communication
between him and his counsel, owing to his
unexpected removal. Ile therefore confided
in the discretion and humanity of the Court,
that they would, in some degree, remedy this
evil, by not proceeding to trial till Tues-
day next at the soonest, in order to afford an
‘interval for such communication between the
prisoners and counsel as was necessary for
their safety.

The Attorney General said, the prisoners
were duly apprized of their being to be ar-
raigned as on this day. Their removal from the
‘Tower to Newgate was arranged to take place
as late as possible, in order to prevent their

being embarrassed by interruption in ther
communication with their friends and couz-
sel. Of the present objection he had heart
nothing till the present moment, which ne
was convinced was unpremeditated, else he
was satisficd that the counsel would not have
concealed it from him. As the great object,
however, he had in view was, that a jure
the country should ultimately decide whether
or not those charges were well or iil. fuunded,
which a grand jury had already declazex! were
not totally destitute of foundation, be was
ready to assent to the delay propuse?. and
therefore had no objection, if the Come
willed it, that the trial of Mr. Hardy scwia
stand over till Tuesday.

The Court accordingly decided to postpox
the commencement of the trials till Tuex2y
next. The attorney-general suggested to tre
Court, either that they must meet on Mounds;
next, for which day the petit jury were suc-
moned, or else they must be summoned airt-a
for Tuesday.

The Court directed that .the sheri:¥ should
give notice to the gentlemen of the ju:
that their presence would not be necessary
till Tuesday ; and that the Court would meet
on Monday morning pro forma, aud so adjwura
over to the following day, then tu process to
business.

The Court was then adjourned till Monday
next at eight o’clock in the morning.

Monday, October 27.

The Court met at seven o'clock in the
morning, pro forma, and adjourned till seven
o'clock in the morning of the next duy.—
