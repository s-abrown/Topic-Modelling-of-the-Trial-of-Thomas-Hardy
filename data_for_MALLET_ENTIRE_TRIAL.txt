ATTORNEYGENERAL 1  May it please your Lordship and gentlemen of the Jury, In the course of stating what I have to offer to your must serious attention in this great and weighty cause, affecting, as it certainly does, the dearest interests of the community, affecting, as you will remember throughout this business, every interest which can be valuable to the prisoner at the bar, I shall have frequent occasion to call that anxious attention to the different parts of the indictment which has just been opened to you. 1 forbear to do so at this moment, because I think that attention will be more usefully, both with respect to the public, and to the prisoner, given and required in another part of what Iam to address to you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2 Gentlemen, the prisoner, who is before you, stands charged (to state the indictment generally) with the offence of compassing his majesty’s death; he was committed upon that charge by his majesty’s privy council: I will explain to you presently why I state this and the following facts. In consequence of the apprehension of this prisoner, of several others charged by this indictment, and of others whose names do not occur in this indictment, proceedings of some notoricty were had in parliament, and an act passed, empowering his majesty to detain such persons as he suspected were conspiring against his government. That act has asserted, that a traitorous and detestable conspiracy had been formed for subverting the existing laws and government of the country, and for introducing that system of anarchy and confusion, which had so fatally prevailed in France ; the act, upon the spur oft the emergency, which it contemplated, authorized the detention without bail, mainprize, or discharge, of the persons then in prison for high treason, or treasonable practices, or who should afterwards be committed, for high treason or treasonable practices, by warrants from the privy council or secretary of state, until the first of February, 1795. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3 Gentlemen, this ‘measure, which did not suspend the operation of the Habeas Corpus act, that great palladium of English liberty, but with reference to particular persons, under particular commitments, for particular offences, is a measure never adopted in this country by parliament but in cases, in which it is understood, after giving all possible atten tion to secure the right of the subject from being broken in upon, to be of the last possible necessity, and which has been repeatedly putin foree, in the best of times, in such cases, where the wisdom of parliament apprehended that it was matter of their duty to rovide that the nation should part with its iberty for a while, that it might not lose it for eraa entlemen, appearing before you this da: in discharge of Sardi, which I have beet commanded to execute and the execution of which appears to me to be absolutely necessary, you will collect from the fact that I do appear here this day, that, accordin, to the true constitutional meaning of suc an act of parliament, it is not that the trial of such persons shall be delayed during the period of the suspension of the act, but that the act shall, with reference to the time of trial, be allowed, in the right execution of it, an operation only to that extent in which the due consideration of the public safety, tempered with a due attention to the liberty of the individual subject, may require. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4 Gentlemen, the proceedings of the legislalature having been such as T have stated to you, his majesty, constitutionally advised in the exercise of his duty, as the great conservator of the public peace, directed a commission to issue to inquire whether any such treasons, as the presumption of such a traitorous conspiracy must necessarily suppose to have existed, had been committed by any persons, and by whom. In the execution of the duties of that commission, a grand jury of this county, upon their oaths, have declared that there is ground of charge against the person at the bar, and against others, sufficient to call upon them, ina trial to be had before you, their country, to answer tov an accusation of high treason, in compassing his majesty’s death. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5 Gentlemen, I have stated these circumstances, that I may convey to you, in as strong terms as I can express it, this observation, that, as the proccedings of parliament ought to have had (and I am persuaded, from the deliberation which they gave the subject, that they had) no influence upon the judicial mind of the grand inquest, ncither ought these proceedings to affect your inquiries, or to induce you to any determination, which you are to make upon the issue, which you are now sworn to try. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6 Gentlemen, there is no one circumstance of any proceedings before parliament, with reference to which you ought to suffer yourselves to be influenced in the trial of this issue. It is obvious that such proceedings, as were had in parliament, providing for great emergencies, may be required and authorized by the genuine spirit of the constitution, even in cases in which a grand jury might not, upon any thing that could be offered to their consideration, be justified in finding a bill: it is much more obvious, that, in a proceeding before you, a consideration of the wisdom and propriety of the acts of the legislature is not called for. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7 You therefore, gentlemen of the jury, will consider the prisoner as standing before you in full possession of an absolute right to the presumption of innocence, notwithstanding e is charged with guilt by this indictment, as you will hear, except so far as that presumption is met by the single simple fact, that he has been accused by a grand jury of his country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8 Gentlemen, before I conclude these generat observations, you will permit me to say, on the other hand, that, if there has been any thing that has fallen under your observation, by act or publication—any attempt to make 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9 ‘ any impression upon the minds of those who are this day impanelied to try this great cause, to disparage that advice, which, under the most responsible sanction, may be given you in matter of law, to work in your minds any prejudice either against the prisoner, or on the prisoner’s behalf; on the one hand I am perfectly sure that your integrity will be security to the public, that you will not permit any attempt of that kind to have any operation; on the other hand, gentlemen of the jury, Tam equally sure that I necd not ask from an English jury, that ane would permit no such attempt to prejudice them against the prisoner at the bar,—no, not even an injudicious or ill executed attempt, to influence them in his favour. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10 Gentlemen, in order to understand the law of treason, and the indictment, I shall take the liberty first to state to you the character which I apprehend the king, for the protection of whose person and government the statute in question was made, has in the State and constitution of this country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11 Gentlemen, the power of the state, by which I mean the power of making laws, and enforcing the execution of them when made, is vested in the king; enacting laws, in the one case, that is, in his legislative character, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords spiritual and temporal, and of the Commons in parliament assembled, assembled according to the law and constitutional custom of England; in the other case, executing the laws, when made, in subservience to the laws so made, and with the advice, which the law and the constitution have assigned to him in almost every instance, in which they have called upon him to act for the benefit of the subject. The king’s authority, under the check of constitutional and legal provisionsand limitations, convenes and regulates the duration and existence of parliament, convening those whom, according to the law and custom of the country, he is bound to convene. The king, in his parliament, sitting in his royal political capacity, and the Lords and Commons there assembled, form the great body politic of the kingdom, by which is exercised sovereign authority in legislation. gentlemen, whilst the present law, the present constitution, and present government of Great Britain, exist, no law can be made but by that authority ; no legislative power can be created against the will, andin defiance of that authority. Whether in any, or in what circumstances, an attempt to create such a power isa treason forbiden by the statute of the 25th of Edward Srd, I propose to examine presently. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 12 Gentlemen, as in the king the power of legislation is vested, as well as the executive power of the state, to be exercised with consent and advice, to be exercised according to those laws, which are the birthright and inheritance of the subject, having upon him the care and protection of the community ; to him, in return, the allegiance of every individual is, according to the law of England, due ; that allegiance, by which the subject is bound, in the Janguage of the statutes of this country, to defend him “ against all traitorous conspiracies and attempts whatsoever, which shall be made against his person, his crown, or his dignity. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 13 Gentlemen, to ascertain to whom this care and protection is committed—to ascertain to whom this allegiance is due, the breach of which, according to the venerable lord Hale, constitutes high treason, is necessary to the peace of the community—to ascertain and to define accurately what constitutes a breach of that allegiance, is essentially and absolutely necessary to the security of all that our ancestors have claimed, demanded, and insisted upon, as the ancient, undoubted rights and liberties of our country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 14 Gentlemen, the former of these ubjects is secured by the law and constitutional custom of England; that law which alike secures to you every right, whether it be a right of person or of property. It has made the crown, which his majesty wears, hereditary (and I beg your attention to that), subject to limi tation by parliament. The latter object has been most anxiously secured by the statute referred to in the indictment, which brings forward the charge, the truth of which you are now to try. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 15 Gentlemen, the king having this hereditary crown, the law and constitution have also ascertained his dutics—those duties, which it is incumbent upon him to execute, for the benefit of the subject, in the execution of which duties they have aided him with counsel, and in consideration of which duties they have clothed him with dignity, and vested him with high prerogatives. With respect to the duties of the king, they attach upon him the instant he becomes such; from the moment that his title accrues, in the same instant the duty of allegiance (the breach of which is high treason) attaches to it; he recognizes these as his duties in that oath, to which, throughout this business, I must again call your attention, in that cath which he is bound to take upon him, at bis coronation, by which he promises and swears “ to govern the people of this country, mark the words, gentlemen, “ according to the statutes in parliament agreed upon, and the laws and customs of the sume ; that to his power he will cause law in justice and mercy to be administered; that he will maintain the laws of God and the true profession of religion established by law. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 16 Gentlemen, this oath, stated by that great and venerable constitutional judge, Mr. Justice Foster, to be a solemn and a public recognition, not only of the duties of the king, but of the fundamental rights of the people, imposeth upon him (and throughoutthis case it cannot be too strongly recollected that it imposeth upon him) the most sacred obligation to govern according to the laws and statutes in parliament agreed upon, according to the laws and customs of the same, and no other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 17 Gentlemen, addressing this Court, which is a court of law, in which you, the jury, are sworn to make a true deliverance according to the law of England, can I impress it too strongly that it cannot be supposed by possibility—not by possibility—that the king can, consistently with his oath, and with the antecedent duty recognized in the explicit engagement, the terms of which you have heard, either act, or permit himself to act, as kin, according to any rules of government, forme: by any bodies of men, assuming any character, functions, or situations, those rules of government being meant to operate as laws, the statutes agreed upon in parliament, and the duws and customs of the same, only excepted ? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 18 Gentlemen, it seems to me to follow, as a necessary conclusion from the reasoning to be addressed to a court of law, not only that those, who conspire to remove the king out of the government altogether, but that those who conspire to remove him, unless he will govern the people according to laws, which are not statutes in parliament agreed upon, and the laws and customs of the same, or as the head of a government framed and modified by any authority not derived from that parliament, do conspire to depose him from that royal state, title, power, and government, which the indictment mentions, and to subvert and alter the rule and government now established in these kingdoms. He ought not so to govern—I say he cannot so govern—he is bound to resist such a project at the hazard of all its consequences; he must resist the attempt; resistance necessarily produces deposition, it endangers his life. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 19 Gentlemen, to that king, upon whom these duties attach, the law and constitution, for the better execution of them, have assigned various counsellors, and responsible advisers : they have clothed him, under various constitutional checks and restrictions, with various attributes and prerogatives, as necessary for the support and maintenance of the civil liberties of the people: they ascribe to him sovereignty, imperial dignity, and perfection : and because the rule and government, as established in this kingdom, cannot exist for a moment without a person filling that office, and able to execute all the duties from time to time, which I have now stated, they ascribe to him also that he never ceases to exist.. In foreign affairs, the delegate and representative of his people, he makes war and peace, leagues and treaties: In domestic concerns, he has prerogatives, as a constituent part of the supreme Tegislature ; the prerogative of raising fleets and armies: he is the fountain of justice, bound to administer it to his people, because it is due to them; the great conservator of public peace, bound to maintain and vindicate it; every where present, that these duties may no where fail of being discharged; the fountain of honour, oflice, and privilege ; the arbiter of domestic commerce, the head of the national church. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 20 Gentlemen, I hope I shall not be thought to mispend your time in stating thus much, because it appears to me that the fact, that such is the character, that such are the duties, that such are the attributes and prerogatives of the king in this country (all existing for the protection, security, and happiness of the people in an established form of governmen}), accounts for the just anxiety, bordering upon jealousy, with which the law watches over his person—accounts for the fact that, in every indictment, the compassing or imagining his destruction, or deposition, seems to be considered as necessarily co-existing with an intention to subvert the rule and government established in the country: it is a purpose to destroy and to depose Aim, in whom the supreme power, rule, and government, under constitutional checks and limitations, is vested, and by whom, with consent and advice in some cases, and with advice in all cases, the exercise of this constitutional power is to be carried on. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 21 Gentlemen, this language, the tenor and charge of every indictment, is most clearly expressed by lord Hale, when he says that high treason is an offence more immediately against the person and gorernment of the king: I cannot state it more strongly to you, or from an authority, the authenticity of which will be less questioned by those who are to defend the prisoner at the bar, than when I state to you the language of one of the counsel for lord George Gordon upon the last trial for high treason: indeed itis no more than what follows the law of England as delivered by all those great lawyers, whosc authority, I am persuaded, will not be attempted to be shaken in the course of this trial, when it states this principle thus : o compass or imagine the death of the king, such imagination or purpose of the mind, visible only to its great Author, being manifested by some open act, an institution obviously directed not only to the security of his natural person, but to the stability of the government, the life of the prince being so Interwoven with the constitution of the state that an attempt to destroy the one is justly held to be a rebellious conspiracy against the other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 22 Gentlemen, it will be my duty to state to you presently what is in law an attempt against the life of the king. It seems, therefore, that when the ancient law of England, —and I would beg your attention to what I am now stating to you,—that when the ancient law of England was changed, which, even in the case of a subject, held the intent to kill homicide, as well as, in the case of the king, the intent to kill or depose, without the fact, where a measure was taken to effectuate the intent, treason, with a difference however as to the nature of the acts deemed sufficient, in the one case, or in the other, to manifest the one or the other intent, that to use the words of a great and venerable authonity, I mean Mr. Justice Foster, “ it was with great propricty that the statute of treason retained the rigour of the law in its full extent in the case of the king. In the case of him, says he, “ whose life must not be endangered, because it cannot be taken away by treasonable practices, without involving a nation in blood and confusion: levelled at him, the stroke is levelled at the public tranquillity. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 23 Gentlemen, that it may be fully understood what it is that I have to contend for in the course of this trial, I put you in mind again that I have before stated, that, as it is absolutely necessary to the security of individuals, Notless necessary to the security of individuals, than it is necessary to the security of the nation which they compese, that the person and government of the king should be thus defended ; on the other Pie i for the security of the subject, it is equally necessary that the crime of high treason should not be indeterminate, that it should not be unascertained, or undefined, either in the law itself, or in the construction to be made of that law. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 24 Gentlemen, this necessity is not to be collected merely in this country from reasoning, though it may obviously enough be collected from reasoning ; the experience of your ancestors has informed you, I admit it, and I beg to press it upon your attention, as much as any man in this court can press it upon your attention, the experience of your ancestors has informed you, in the just and bitter complaints which are to be found in thcir annals, of the periods, in which no man knew how he ought to behave himself, todo, speak, or say, for doubt of pains of treason,—in the anxiety with which the statute of Edward Srd reserved the judgment of all treasons not there expressly specified—“ that the justices should tarry without going to judgment of the treason, till the cause be showed and declared before the king and his pannel ;—in the expressive language, which your ancestors have used, when the provisions of the statute of Edward were first introduced into the code of law under which we live, and of those statutes, by which treasons were brought back to the provisions of that statute, the experience of your ancestors, thus handed down to you, has demonstrated this necessity. I admit too (and my treating the subject thus in the outset may ultimately save your bathe that before the statute was made, upon whic! the indictment proceeds, the security of the subject was not sufficiently provided for. I admit that security is not sufficiently provided for now, if construction can be allowed to give an exposition to the statute, which the legislature did not intend it should receive. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 25 Gentlemen, upon each of these heads it was necessary for me to trouble you with some, and but with a few observations. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 26 That the law of treason should be determinate and certain, though clearly necessary for the security of the subject, is not more necessary for their security, than that there should be a law of treason, and that this law should be faithfully, duly, and firmly executed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 27 Gentlemen, every state must have some form or regimen of government; in other words, it must determine by whom, and under what modifications, the sovereign power is to be exercised in the country; tor no government can exist, unless this power is placed somewhere: and the attempt to subvert that power is, in the nature of the thing, an attempt to subvert the established government. It is of necessity that an attempt of this sort should be guarded against, by severer penalties than offences, which being breaches of particular laws, do not endanger the very existence of the state itself, which do not involve, in the destruction of the state, the destruction of all laws, but which leave the law, though violated in particular cases, sufficient, in general cases, for the protection of the personal security, the liberty, and happiness of the subject. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 28 Gentlemen, this is also the reasoning of that great judge, whose name I before mentioned to you, my lord Hale : “ The greatness of the offence, he says, “and the severity of the punishment, is upon these reasons: First, because the safety, peace, and tranquillity of the kingdom is highly concerned in the safety and preservation of the person, dignity, and government of the king, and therefore the laws of the kingdom have given all possible security to the king’s person and government, and under the severest penalties. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 29 Gentlemen, to describe this great offence with precision and accuracy, was what the legislature in Edward's time proposed, when they enacted the sacred statute upon which this indictment is founded; that statute was made for the more precise definition of this crime, which, by the common law, had not been sufficiently extended, and “ the plain anextended letter of it, you will mark the words, “ the plain unextended letter of it was thought to be a sufficient protection to the person and honour of the sovereign; but not only to the person and honour of the sovereign, but “ an adequate security to the laws committed to his execution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 30 Gentlemen, in addressing a jury if a court of law, sworn to make deliverance according to that law which constitutes the court in which they sit, there are two propositions, which appear to nf to be alike clear: the first is, that I ought not, that I cannot dare to call upon you to say, that there has been committed under this statute any offence, if the facts of the case to be laid before you, by plain, manifest, authorized interpretation of the statute, do not constitute an offence under it; if the statute should seem to any man, or to you, not to be a sufficient and adequate security to the person and honour of the sovereign, and the due execution of the laws, it is nevertheless all the security which the law has authorized you to give them, and God forbid that you should think of giving more. On the other hand, you are bound by your oaths, if this law has been violated in fact, if the fact of violation is proved by evidence, convincing in its nature, and such in its form as the law requires (for the law in this case requires not only convincing, but formal cvidence), then you are bound to give to the person and honour of the sovereign, and to the laws of your country, that protection, which a verdict, asserting in substance that the statute has been violated, would give, and which the statute intended should be given. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 31 Gentlemen, men of honour and of conscience, acting under the sanction of the oath which they have taken, must come to the same conclusion, judging of the same facts, by the same law, whatever their principles of government may be, unless they differ upon the effect of the tacts laid before them. In the trial of a person, whose name I shall have abundant reason to mention to you in the course of this proceeding, I mean the author of the Rights of Man, charged with a libel against the monarchy of the country, it was judiciously, truly, justly, and strongly adMnitted in effect, that, if the jury had been composed (if there are twelve such men in this country) of republicans, wishing to overturn the government of the country, yet administering the law of England, in a court of English law, if they were convinced that the crime had, according to that law, been committed, no man would have the audacity to say that they. could be capable of that crime against the public, to think for a moment of not coming to the conclusion, which the facts called for, according to the law by which they were sworn to decide upon the matter before them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 32 Gentlemen, the statute upon which this indictment proceeds, is to the following effect : —it states (and it states most truly), “ that divers opinions had been had before this time, that is, the 25th Edward Srd, “ in what case treason should be said, and in what not : the king, at the request of the Lords and of the Commons, hath made a declaration in the manner as hereafter followeth, that is to say, when a man doth compass or imagine the death of our lord the king, or of our lady his queen, or of their eldest son and heir; or ifa man do violate the king’s companion, or the king’s eldest daughter, upmarricd, or the wife of the king’s eldest son and heir ; or if a man do levy war against our lord the king in his tealm, or be adherent to the king’s enemies in his realm, giving to them aid and comfort in the realm or elsewhere, and thereof be provably attainted—by which words I understand be attainted by evidence, that clearly and forcibly satisfies the minds and consciences of those who are to try the fact— “attainted of open deed by people of their condition,—then there is this, to which you will be bound to give your attention for the sake of the prisoner, as well as for the sake of the public, the interests of both being blended in this great cause; “ and because that many other like cases of treason may happen in time to come, which a man cannot think nor declare at this present time, it is accorded that, if any other case, supposed treason, which is not above specified, doth happen before any justices, the justices shall tarry without any going to judgment of the treason till the cause be showed and declared before the king and his parliament, whether it ought to he judged treason, or other felony. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 33 Gentlemen, I desire to point out here, in the most marked way in which I can state it, the anxiety, with which the parliament wished to preserve to itself the judgments of treasons, not being the specified treasons in the statute, but being like treasons, those which, by a parity of reasoning. might be said to be treason. They would not trust the subjects of the country in the hand of any court of justice upon that point I mark the circumstance, because it appears to me to give a degree of authority to the law of England upon the subject of treason, and to the constructions, which have been made upon it, and to the distinctions, which have been made between like treasons, and overt acts of the same treason, that perhaps does not belong to constructions and distinctions adopted in the course of judicial proceedings upon any other law in the statute-book. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 34 Gentlemen, having read the statute to you, it is not unimportant, as it seems to me, to observe that lord Hale and Mr. Justice Foster, who have stated the judicial and other expoweighty caution, which they most powerfull express: under the solemn protests, whic! they most strongly state, against extending this statute by a parity of reason. This circumstance alone appears to me to give infinite authenticity to the expositions, which they state of it, as sound, and as being such as, according to the interpretation, which the legislature in Edward Srd‘s time meant, should be put upon this statute. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 35 Gentlemen, I think it may also save your time, and that of the Court, if I trouble you here by reading, before I state to you the expositions of the statute which lord Hale has given us, deducing them from judgments which had been actually made in the history of the country, the language which he holds, as describing the obligations, which courts of justice, and men looking at this statute for the purpose of executing it, are under, to construe it according to the real specified meaning, not by a parity of construction as to the treason itself, when they came to construe it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 36 Lord Hale states it thus : “ Although the crime of high treason is the greatest crime against faith, duty, and human society, and brings with it the greatest and most fatal dangers tu the government, peace, and happiness of a kingdom or state, and therefore is deservedly branded with the highest ignominy, and subjected to the greatest penalties t the law can inflict, yet by these instances —he is stating those that had occurred before the statute of Edward Srd and between that and the first of Henry 4th—“ yet by these instances, and more of this kind that might be given, it appears—first, how necessary it was that there should be some fixed and settled dary for this great crime of treason, and of what great importance the statute of the 25th of Edward 3rd. was in order. to that end; secondly, how dangerous it is to depart from the letter of that statute, and to multiply and enhance crimes into treason by ambiguous and general words—as accroaching of royal power, subverting of fundamental laws, and the like; and thirdly, how dangerous it is by construction and analogy to make treasons, where the letter of the Law has not done it, for such a method admits of no limits or bounds, but runs as far as the wit and invention of accusers, and the odiousness and detestation of persons accused, will carry men. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 37 In another passage, after having given his comment upon this statute—after havin; stated what are the overt acts, which fa witbin the letter of it, and the sound interpretation of it, he says, “It has been the great wisdom and care of the parliament to Eoep judges within the bounds and express limits of this act, and not to suffer them to run out upon their own opinions into constructive treasons, though in cases that seem to have a parity of reason (like cases of treason), but reserves them to the decision of pare liament. This is a great security as well as direction to judges, and a great safeguard even to this sacred act itself; and therefore, as before I observed, in the chapter of levying of war, this clause of the statute leaves a weighty memento for judges to be carcful that they be not over-hasty in letting in constructive or interpretative treasons, not within the letter of the law, at least in such new cases as have not been formerly expressly resolved, and settled by mere than one precedent. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 38 Gentlemen of the jury, Iam persuaded, as those were persuaded who conducted the defence of lord George Gordon, that we live in days, in which the judges of the country neither have the inclination nor the courage to stretch the law beyond its limits. I think myself bound to state that; and those, who dare to state the contrary in any place, do not do the justice to the country, which is due from every individual in it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 39 Gentlemen, having stated thus much to you, I now state, in order to be perfectly understood, that I do most distinctly disavow making any charge of constructive treason ; that Ido most distinctly disavow stating in this indictment any like case of treason not specified in the statute; that I do most distinctly disavow stating any thing that can be called cumulative treason or analogous treason ; thatI do most distinctly disavow enhancing any thing, by a parity of reason, into treason, which is not specified in that statute ; that I do most distinctly disavow enhancing crimes of any kind, or a life spent in crimes, if you choose so to put it, into treason, if it be not treason specified in the statute ; and the question between us I state distinctly to he this— Whether the defendant is guilty of a treason specified in the statute, and whether the evilence that is to be brought before you amounts to that proof, that will te satisfactory to your minds and consciences, your minds and consciences being prepared to admit no proof, but what you think you ought to reccive under the obligation of an oath, proof high enough that he may be “ provably attainted of open deed, of a treason specified in the statute, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 40 Then, gentlemen, to state the charge to you : The indictment charges the defendant with compassing and imagining the king’s death, and with having taken measures to effectuate that purpose — Now, that it may be thoroughly understood, you will permit me to state to you here, that there is not only a manifest distinction in reason, but a settled distinction in the course of judicial practice, settled for no other cause but that it was a manifest distinction in reason, between—“ like cases of treason, constructive, analogous, or cumulative treasons, and various overt acts of the same treason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 41 Gentlemen, whether the acts laid as overt acts of treason, specified in the statute, and specae! in the indictment, amount, in all eir circumstances, to an open deed, or deeds by which a ae may be provably attainted of the specified treason, is the question which ajury are to try. To explain myself upon this, I take it to be clear, and I will not, in this stage of the business at least, enter intothe discussion of what I call the clear and established law of England, hecause I will not in a case of high treason, any more than I would in a dispute about the estate of any gentleman who hears me, for the purpose of arguing points, enter into discussions upon what I take to be the clear and established law of England; and not only the security of the subject in this respect cannot, but the sesanto the subject in no respect, in his person, his life, or his property, can be taken to exist in this country, if I am not as fully authorized to state to you, with as much confidence, what the law Is, incase of treason, from the decisions, which for centuries have heen tnade in courts respecting it, as [am to state to you, from decisions of courts respectingproneny what the law of property is. I say, take it to be clear that deposing the king, entering into measures for deposing the king, conspiring with foreigners and others to inwade the kingdom, going to a foreign country to procure the invasion of the kingdom, or proposing to go there to that end, and taking any step in order thereto—conspiring to raise an insurrection, either to dethrone the king, imprison the king, or oblige him to alter his measures of government, orto compel him to remove evil counsellors from him, are, and have all been held, as Mr. Justice Foster says, to be deetls proving an intent to do that treason, which is mentioned in the statute to be overt acts of treason in compassing the king’s death, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 42 It would he very extraordinary if these great judges, Foster and Hale, after holding the language they have stated, were to be represented by any man, as not acting themselves under the effect and influence of that weighty memento, which they held out to those who “were to succecd them in the seat of judgment; yet I state all this to you in the words in which ‘these learned judges have handed down the exposition of the statute, who would have suffered death, for they both valued the liberties of their country, before they would have. charged “a like case of treason in an indictment; and yet they have concurred (as all the judges of England have done, and the parliament into the bargain) in the construction and exposition of the statute (and in fact executions have been made upon it), that all these things are overt acts of the same treason, that is specified in the statute. What is the reason of it? because the law holds that he, who does an act, meaning to do it, which may endanger the king’s lite, compasses and imagines the death of the king, if he does an act which may endanger his life, if im the ordinary course of things, and according to the common experience of mankind, the measure which he takes, in pursuance of a purpose to take it, will bring the king to his grave. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 43 This therefore is not raising constructive treason, it is not raising treason by analogy, it is not stating “ like cases of treason not specified in, but reserved by the statute to the judgment of parliament, but it is stating overt acts, which are measures taken in pursuance of treasonable purposes, which measures must necessarily be as various in their kinds, asthe ways and means, by which, in facts and open deeds, taken in pursuance of its purposes, the human heart manifests its intent to commit some one or other of the treasons specified in the statute. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 44 Gentlemen, the reserving clause in the act is extremely material; and, if courts and juries have done wrong in the manner in which they have executed this statute, if the inter. pretatons, which they have made of the statute, are not right, they have done it against a prohibition in the statute, which they were called upon by their oaths duly to expound, and they have done it in the presence and under the eye of that parliament, which had expressly forbidden them to doit. I say the conelusion upon that is, that they have done it rightly. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 45 Gentlemen, the judgments of the courts of law are in this country perfectly familiar to parliavent. Acts have been made, over and over agiin, in order to bring back the expositions of the Jaw to the true construction, to the letter, which is the true construction, in a ; sound Judicial sense, to bring it back againto the statute of Edward Srd; but we have lived to this hour without parliament thinking that they were tomake so perfectly a dead letter of the letter of the statute, as that they should say that an overt act, which expressed and inported the imagination of the mind to do the treason specified, should not be taken to be anact of high treason within the statute ; because the statute only mentions the thing which is to be compassed and imagined, and doc: not mention the ways and means, by whick the human heart may show and manifest that it does compass and imagine what thestatute speaks of. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 46 Gentlanen, this is not all, because this is not only iccording to the law of England, as itis admnistered in courts of justice, but also to the preceedings in parliament, which are a parliameatary exposition, if 1 may so state it, of the lav. Proceedings in parliament have been had where the statute has been thus construe, and where this distinction that I am statirg between overt acts of the specified treason and the “ like cases of treason, hasthe indictment lays the imagining and com. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 47 been expressly taken, expressly acted upon, proposed by one house of the legislature to the other house, and acted upon by the crown in executing the sentences of that house. Gentlemen, the distinction then is only this —“a like case of treason is a case of treason not specified in the statute, a case of the like mischief, as a case specified in the statute; but the identical case specified in the statute must be before yuu, or, to avoid all dispute upon the subject, I say, if it be a case that isnot specified in the statute, it is a case that must be shown to parliament according to the directions of the statute: but that facts alike in their nature, that open deeds alike in their nature and tendency, however various in their circumstances, may prove the same intention to exist in the minds of those who do them, and may be measures, taken in pursuance of the same purpose, and to effectuate the same thing, is a distinction that appears to my mind to be perfectly obvious. Gentlemen, I conccive, therefore, that the uestion of compassing the king’s death is this—whether the jury are fully satisticd, conscientiously satisfied, that they have that evidence, by which they find that the acts, laid as overt acts of compassing the particular specified treason mentioned in the indictment, were measures taken in pursuance of and to effectuate that treason, specified at once in the statute and in the indictment. Gentlemen, I protest for mysclf I am sorry to trouble you thus much at large by general reasoning, but you will find that it has an application, and a close application, to the ease. This is an important public cause, and therefore we should be thoroughly understood, I cannot understand what constructive overt actsmean, though I do understand constructive treasons. Levying war against the kng, not against his person, but against his roya. majesty, is constructive treason ; thatis, if menassemble together without any intent to do an act, which in the natural consequence of things will affect the king's life, such as pullingdown all prisons or houses of any other descristion, that is constructive treason, it being, by construction, as Mr. Justice Foster says, against the king’s royal majesty, not levied against his person : not one of the acts of a more flagitious kind, wilfully done or attempted to be ne, by which the king’s life may he in danger, but which are levelled against lis royal majesty; these have by construction been held to be treason: but even these he legislature has never considered as not atthorized by the letter of the statute ; these tley have permitted to be proceeded upon in the country as sound decisions and constructbns upon the act of parliament: many have teen convicted upon them; execution hath ollowed ; and no one hath ever doubted eithe: the law or the justice of these determinations. But, as to constructive overt acts of canpassing and imagining the death of the king, where passing as the offence, the overt act is not constructive, the step taken to effectuate it must be such an act, wiltully and deliberately done, as must satisfy the conscience of a jury that there was an intention, by deposing, or otherwise, tu put the king in circumstances, in which, according to the ordinary experience of mankind, his life would be in danger. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 48 Gentlemen, I have befure stated to you, for another purpose, various acts, which are overt acts of compassing the king’s death. I will repeat them shortly: “ Deposing him,—entering into measures to uepese him,—conspiring to imprison him,—which you observe is an act that may be done without an actual intent to put him to death—a man may conspire to imprison the king without an actual intent to put him to death, but you will find the reason why that is held to be compassing and imagining the death of the king, with the sanction of all times since this statute of Edward 3rd, and with the sanction of every species of judicial authority, which the country could give; “ to get his person into the power of conspirators. Why is all this treason? ‘ Because, says Mr. Justice Fuster, “ the care, which the law hath taken for the personal safety of the king, is not confined to actions or attempts of a more flagitious kind, such as attempts either to assassinate, or to poison, or other attempts, directly and immediately aiming at his life; it is extended to every thing, wilfully and deliberately done, or attempted, whereby his life may be endangered ; and therefore the entering ints measures for depusing, or imprisoning hira, or to get his persun into the power of the conspirators,—these offences are overt acts of treason within this branch of the statute; for experience hath shown that between the prisons and the graves of princes the distance is very small, and expericnce has not grown weaker upon this subject in modern times; offences which are not so personal as those already mentioned, have been, with great propriety, brought within the same rule, as having a tendency, though not so immediate, to the same fatal end. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 49 Lord Hale, upon this, says, “ Though the conspiracy be not immediately, and directly, and expressly the death of the king, but the conspiracy is of something that in all probability must induce it, and the overt act is of such a thing as must induce it, this is an overt act to prove the compassing of the king’sdeath. The instance he gives, as expository of his text, is this; “If men conspire to imprison the king by force and a strong hand till he hath yielded to certain demands, and for that purpose gather company, or write letters, this is an overt act to prove the compassing of the king's death. What is the reason? he gives the same in substance, though different in the terms of it, as that which has been assigned by Mr. Justice Foster: “ for it is in effect to despoil him of his kingly government. These are the words of lord Hale; and though the reasons given by lord Ilale and Mr. Justice Foster are ditterent in words, they are the same in substance. It may be said, with equal truth, between despoiling a king of his kingly government and the graves of kings the distance is very small. Imprisonment is the same as deposition, and he whu compasses thedeposition of the king, according to all judicial construction, compasses his death; it is ; the same as deposition, because it is a temporary despoiling him of his kingly government, which, according to this interpretation of the ; law, usually ends in death. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 50 Gentlemen, offences not so personal as those enumerated fall within the same rule, as having a tendency to the same fatal end: if foreigners are not at war with you, the offence of guing into a forcign country, or propusing to go there, or taking any step thereto in order to invite foreigners into this kingdui for a treasonable purpose, can only tall within that branch of treason of compassingthe king's death ; if they are at war with you, then the same act amounts to another species of treason, which is an “adhering to the King’s enemies ; and perhaps you will find that the case I have to state is not without pregnant evidence of this species of overt act. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 51 Gentlemen, haying stated thus much to you, I proceed now to consider the indictment; and what I have stated, before I mentioned the substance of the indictment, I have stated to lay in my claim to full credit with you, whenIsay, that no man living can wish to express to you more strongly ! than I wish to do (we have indced, each of us, as great an interest in the true construction of this law, as any other man can have in it), that the law of treason, in considering the charge, that I have brought before you under the command that has authorized me to bring it here, must not be extended one single iota beyond what is the established law in this country, as established as the law is, that says that the property that you bought yesterday, you may give to whom you lease to-morrow. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 52 Gentlemen, the indictment, finding several persons entitled to be tried separately, though Indicted jointly, combined ina particular act, which I will state by-and-hy, has charged them with compassing the king’s death: it has then proceeded, because the compassing and imagination of the heart cannot be known to man—and there must be an overt act to manifest it—it bas charged them with meeting among themselves to cause and procure a convention of divers subjects of the king, to be held within this kingdom, and not only a eonvention to be held within the Kingdom, but to be held with intent and in order that the persons to be assembled at such convention and meeting should and might, wickedly and traitorously, without and in defiance of the authority, and against the will of lhe parliament of this kingdom, subvert and alter the legislature, rule, and goocrnment established in it, and depose the king from the royal state, title, power, and gocernment thereof. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 53 It then charges them with having composed, written, and published, and caused to e composed, written, and published, divers books, pamphlets, letters, instructions, resolutions, orders, declarations, addresses and writings, such books, pamphlets, letters, instructions, resulutions, orders, declarations, addresses and writings, su respectively composed, written, published, and caused to be composed, written, and published, purporting and containing therein (among other things) incitements, encouragements, and exhortations, to move, induce, and persuade the subjects of the king tochoose, depute, and send persons, as delegates, to cumpose, not a convention, but SUCH a convention and mcecting, that is, a convention to act in the manner that the first overt act has stated it, to be holden for the traie torous purposes befure mentioned. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 54 It then states, as a third overt act, consultations among them, how, when, and where, such convention and meeting should be assembled and held, and by what means the subjects of the king might be induced and moved to send persons as delegates to constitute it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 55 It then charges, that these persons did consent and agree, that Mr. Jovce and several other persons named, should meet, confer, and co-operate among themselves and with other traitors, to cause the calling and assembling such convention and meeting for such traitorous purposes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 56 It then charges the providing of arms, of different descriptions, fur these purposes; and then it charges a conspiracy to make war in the kingdom, anditchargesaconspiracy to subvert and alter the legislature aud government of the kingdom, and to depose the king: that is, as I understand it, that, if you should not be satisfied that the calling such a convention, as is mentioned in the first part of the indictment, was a mean to effectuate that compassing and imagination, which is mentioned tn the introductory part of the indictment, yet you will tind in the evidence, which is to be laid before you, even if yor pay no‘attention to that circumstance of calling a convene tion, sutticient evidence of a conspiracy to depose the king. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 57 It then states again, that they published several books, and other matters of the same kind, in order to bring about the traitcruas purposes Jast mentioned ; and charges, as a farther overt act, providing arms fur that purpose. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 58 Now, gentlemen, having before stated to you, that a conspiracy to depose the king,— 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 59 and I have not stated it to you in my own words, but in the words of the authorities I mentioned,—that a conspiracy to depose the king, that a conspiracy to imprison the king, a conspiracy to procure an invasion, with steps taken to effectuate such a conspiracy (a conspiracy indeed itself being a step for that purpose), is treason; you will observe that In this indictment, a conspiracy to depose the king is expressly charged, and, think, it will be clearly proved. If a conspiracy to depose the king be an overt act of high treason, permit me then to ask you, what can a conspiTacy to subvert the monarchy of the country, including in it the deposition of the king, be, but an overtact of high treason? In the object of such a conspiracy the king is necessarily involved, and it is already shown that conspiring to depose him is compassing his death. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 60 Gentlemen, read as you are in the history of the country, give me leave to ask you, if measures had been taken, after the Revolution, to effectuate a conspiracy to dethrone king William, and to restore king James, without all doubt, the measure taken, would have constituted the crime of high treason within the clause of compassing the king’s death, although the conspirators could have been shown satistactorily to have no more meant the actual natural death of king William, than they meant the actual natural death of king James, whom they intended to replace upon the throne—but what says the law to that; the law says you cannot mean to depose the king without meaning to endanger his life, and if you mean to endanger his life you must abide the consequences of it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 61 Put it another way—lIf the project had been to depose the same king William, and measures had been taken upon it—not witha view to bring back to the throne king James 2d, but merely to send back king William to his former character of Prince of Orange, and not to restore king James, but to restore a commonwealth, which is what, I think I shall satisfy you, those, who are charged by this indictment, meant by “a full and fair representation of the people, whether you eall it “ a full and fair representation of the people in parliament, or do not use the words “in parliament, can a lawyer be found to say, that it could be stated in law, that it is not high treason? I do not know what may not be stated—all that I mean to say at present is, that according to the best lights which I can get of the law under which —I have lived, it does not appear to me to be probable, that any man will so state it. Far be it from me, however, to have the vanity to say that (avowing that I should certainly not think of encountering the current authorities of the country for centuries) I am, without the possibWity of contradiction, stating that I am following the authorities of the country for centuries ; but I am ready to say this, that I cannot conceive or imagine by what species of teasoning, or upon what principle, or upon what authority, it is to be contended, that this would not have been high treason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 62 Gentlemen, take it another way—if the regicides ef king Charles 1st had been tried for compassing the death of king Charles 1st, supposing they had only deposed him, instead of putting him to death, could they have contended, that though they would have been guilty of high treason if they had placed another individual upon the throne (which would have been alike to the case I have put, of conspiring to put James in the bps of Wil liam), could they have contended then, that they were not guilty of high treason, because they deposed the king without substituting another king in his place; and because they left the governmentto be filled up by the commonwealth, without a king? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 63 Give me leave to ask another thing—suppose it had happened after king William came to the throne, that not those events, which did actually happen, took place, but that any set of men in this country should have ventured to meet in a convention of delegates from aftiliated societies, for the purpose of deposing king William, under pretence of assembling a convention of the people, havi: or claiming the civil and political authority of the country, and intending to have no king in the country, would it have been possible in king William’s time to have contended, because they met, under pretence of being a convention ef the people, assuming to themselves civil and political authority, and with such meaning, that the conspiracy was not as completely a cempassing the death of king William, as if the conspiracy had been, by the same persons, in the case of affiliated soc eties, forming the like convention of delegates, to bring king James again to the throne? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 64 If I levy war in this country against the king, with intent to bring another upon the throne, 1 am guilty of high treason. IfI levy war, that is an overt act of compassing the king’s death. If I conspire to levy direct war that is a compassing of the king’s death, um less all the branches of the legislature have puta man to death upon anerror. If I hold a fortress against the king to put another upon his throne, I am guilty of high treason. Am I guilty of no offence if I do the same acts not for the!purpose of continuing the monarchy of the country in another person, but for the purpose of destroying the monarchy altogether? What is this but doing an act involving in it high treason, and more? High treason in depusing the king! more—in bringing about all that additional anarchy, which we know, which the experience of mankind Proves to be consequent upon the change, where the change is not only of the persons who administer the government, but of the government itself, if destruction can be called a change? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 65 Gentlemen, to assert therefore that measures, taken for a total subversion of the monarchy of the country, including in it an intention to depose the king (mark the words, I state, including in it an intention to depose the king), are not overt acts of compassing the king's death, merely because the statute of Edward 3rd, has not included all overt acts in words, but as left to juries to determine what are overt acts, by which they can pruvahly attaint—to assert that the statute does not include the case, because it is compassing the death of the king, and more; if this were to be asserted ina court of justice (what is asserted out of a court of justice no man pays much attention to),should certainly say of it, that it was the assertion of those who had ill considered the law; and if asserted out of a court of justice, and with a reference to what isto be done in a court of justice, I should say it deserved to have an observation of a harsher kind made upon it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 66 This indictment, besides charging a conspiracy to depose the king, in express terms, of which I shall insist before you there is abundant evidence, charges a cunspiracy to call a convention against the will, in defiance of, and against the authority of parliament, for the purpose of deposing the king ; it charges farther acts, namely, that they caused to be composed and written divers books, pamphlets, letters, instructions, resolutions, orders, declarations, addresses, and writings, cuntaining incitements, inducements, and exhortations, to move, seduce, and persuade the subjects of the king to send delegates to such convention ; as to whichIsay of many of them, though I did not know their real character till 1 had seen them all together, that they are both overt acts, und evidence of overt acts of high treason, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 67 Now, before I state to you the particulars of the evidence, Iam afraid I must, however pulnfal it i8 to me to ask so great a portion of your attention. trouble you with some gencral observations, that I think will have a tendency to render intelligible to you the cumplicated mass of evidence, which I have to lay before you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 68 Gentlemen, the convention, meant to be called by those who are charged with the conspiracy in this indictment, was, as I collect from the effect of the evidence, a convention of persons, who were to assume the character of a convention of the people, claiming, as such, all civil and political authority, proPosing to exercise it by altering the government, otherwise than by acts of the present constituted legislature, otherwise than by those statutes, according to which the king has sworn at the hazard of his life to govern. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 69 Gentlemen, if this is made out, it appears to me to follow necessarily on the part of all who took a step to assemble it, that they are gucity of a conspiracy to depose the king, to depose him trom the character which he holds in the constitution of the sovereign power of this kingdom, as by law established, that law by which I again repeat to you, he is sworn yo govern. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 70 Gentlemen, if they conspired to assemble ina convention, which was of its own authority, and against the will of the legislature, and in defiance of it, to act as an assembly to constitute a government, and to assume so far sovereign power, it is, I conceive, according to the law of England, a conspiracy to depose from the sovereignty him, who under the restraints of the constitution and the law, now holds that sovereignty. There cannot be two sovercign powers in a state; there may be a complication of authorities vested in a great variety of persons, making up one sovereizn power, but there cannot be two sovereign powers ina state: itisimpoussible. Ifa mecting assembled as a convention of the people, arrogating to themselves all civil and political authority us such, and meaning to exercise it, one or other of these consequences must follow: the king and the parliament must be obedient to the meeting, or the meeting, asscinbled as a convention, must be obedient to flic king and parliament : if the mecting isto be obedient to the king and parliament, it cannot eticct its purposes; it is impossible : if its purpose be to depose the king, I say, a conspiracy to call such a meeting is an overt act of high treason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 71 Gentlemen, I beg your attention to my expressions : if the meeting means to oblige the king and parliament to be obedient to them by the exertion of open force, though it may not effect its purpose, that makes no difference, the law must be the same—I may be wrong Perhaps in stating the law, but it appears to me that the law must be the same if the meeting projects the purpose, whether the force of the meeting is suflicient to effect the Purpose or not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 72 This, I say, is a conspiracy to assume the sovereign power: it is a conspiracy therefore of necessity meant to depose the existing power, and of necessity to depose the king. I say meant to depose; for I repeat it, that whether the conspiracy is successful or not, is immaterial. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 73 Gentlemen, though the particular fact of calling such a convention, now alleged as an overt act of treason, may be represented to be new in the history of this country, it is not therefore, and because it is new only inasmuch as it is more than ordinarily audacious, less an overt act of compassing the death or deposition of the king, if the intent of it was to sub. vert the sovercign ruling power. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 74 Gentlemen, there is another distinction, ta which I would beg your attention. It is of no consequence whether the first meeting, proposed to be assembled, was designed to be a convention, thal should assume all civil and political authority, or was only to detise the means of forming a constituent assembly, u body which should assume it; for any act taken towards assuming it against the will, in defiance of, and against the authority of the king and parliament, and removing him from that situa tion in the character of sovereign, which he has in this country; any act taken towards the formation of a body, which was to assume such authority, is an act of conspiring the deposition of the king: any act towards convening a national assembly, to act with sovereign power, not formed by the legislature, is an act done towards deposing the king, who now has, under the restraints of the constitution, and the provisions and limitations of the law, the sovercign power vestedin him. You cannot set about organizing a body, which is thus to act, without meaning to depose the king, without meaning to form a body that is to usurp the powers of government. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 75 Genticmen, I think the evidence, that I shall lay before you, will most abundantly satisfy you that the convention, which the persous charged conspired to form, was a convention to alter the whole form of the sovereign power of this country, that it was to form, or to devise the means of forming, a representalive government—to vest in a body, founded upon universal suffrage, and ‘the al leged unalienable, and, as they are called, imprescriptible rights of man, al the legislative and executive government of the country ; that aconspiracy to this end would be an overt act of high treason, I presume cannot be disputed; it deposes the king in the destruction of the regal office in the constitution of the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 76 state. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 77 Gentlemen, I go farther: if it had been intended to have retamed the name and office of the king in the country, and to have retained it in the person of the present king, creating, however, by the authority of the intended convention, a new legislature, to act with him, provided they would allow him to act with such new legislature, and thus calling upon him to act against the express obligations of his cororation oath, if he could forget it, it still would have been a conspiracy to depose him from his royal authority, as now established: if he refused to act, he must necessarily be deposed from that authority ; if he did accept, he was not the king of England, as he is established by law the king of England. But he could not accept; he could not so govern; he is sworn not so to govern; he must refuse, must resist, and, in consequence of resisting, his life must be in danger. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 78 Take it either way, that persons conspired to form a convention to assume all civil and political authority, as pretending to be a convention of the people (I care not with how much audacity they pretend to be a convention of the people), or to devise the means of constituting such a convention, in order, and with the intent, and against the authority of parliament, that there should be no king, or in order to the erecting, by their own authority, a new legislature to act together with a king, and together with the king, if they permitted the present to be the king, I submit that such a conspiracy is an overt act in the true construction of law, and high treason in dompassing the king’s death. The king must be deposed while such a new constitution was framing ; he could not treat with such a convention till he had been deposed ; it could be those only, that had sovereign authority, that could frame a constitution: then he is surely, by this, despoiled of his kingly government, even as in a case, of temporary imprisonment. I repeat again, that he could not, consistently with his coronation oath, do otherwise than reject it when framed: it must be taken for granted he would reject it; his life, therefore, could not but be in danger. To suppose that such a meeting, which proposed a new consutution, would depart quietly home, and not act, if it was not accepted, is out of the reach of all human credulity ; itis not according to the ordinary course and experience of mankind, to suppose that they should meet in numbers, and make no use of their numbers, if the show of them did not produce the effect intended : this is not according to the ordinary course and experience of mankind. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 79 Gentlemen, the king in his parliament could not be the sovercign powcr the moment the meeting could act as a national constituting assembly, or could direct, with effect, such an assembly to meet. The power sv to act, or to organize with effect such a meeting that should so act, must pro tempore depose every other power. This 1s the character of a convention of the people, I think, as given in the evidence I have to lay before you. With respect to the detendant, I think I shall satisly you he conspired to call such a convention; and that he said that the convention, which I am to call, is irresistible, it is unlimited, it is uncontrollable, and that by such a convention, my full and fair representalion of the people, or a full and fair representation in parliament (if you choose to take that expression, for it is not mere expression that determines what men mean), is to be accomplished. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 80 Gentlemen, in the country in which I am speaking, when a vacant throne was given (1 am now alluding to the time of king Willian) by those, who, as they are stated in the Bi of Rights, represented all the estates of the people of this realm, to king William and queen Mary, they, who gave it, ceased to have or to exercise the power of sovereignty : in that instant, as every lawyer must speak of it, in that instant the sovereign power of this coon became vested in the king and queen upon the throne, to be exercised in legislation, undoubtedly, with the advice and consent ov parliament, formed according to the Inw and custom of the country—incapable of being exercised otherwise, and, as to the executive authority, exercised under the control of provisions and limitations of the law and constitution, and with the advice which, in every act which the king does, makes somebody responsible. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 81 I insist that the design of conspiring to assemble the people, who were to act as a convention of the people, claiming all civil and political authority, or claiming power to alter, against its will, the constituted legisiature, or a mecting to form the means of bringing together such a convention so to act, Is an attempt to create a power subversive of the authority of the king and parliament, a power, which he is bound by oath to resist at all hazards. But it will not rest here: this will be sufficiently proved; but evidence will likewise be offered to you as satisfactory to prove that the express object of calling this convention, the express object of appointing a committe of conference and co-vperation, which was to devise the means of constituting sich a convention, was ultimately, and finally, and in their prospect, the deposition of the king. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 82 Convene, beyond this, and supposing it not to be proved, the indictment has charged as overt acts, a conspiracy, without the mean of a convention, and not through that enedium, to depose the king; if that consp acy is made out by otheracts, though neither a convention, assuming all political authority, nor a meeting to devise the means of calling a convention, which should assume all political authority, was intended, yet the indictment is made good. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 83 Gentlemen, the indictment farther charges as an overt act of compassing the king’s death, which without question it is, the conspiracy to levy war; I do not mean constructive war. This I state, without question, to be an overt act of compassing the king’s death. A rising to oblige the king toalter his measures of government amounts to levying war within the statute. - A conspiracy to levy war for this purpose is an overt act of compassing the king’s death. If they conspired to form a representative government, excluding the king entirely, which I say is the fact, or, if they conspired not to form a representative government, excluding the king entirely, but yet tocompel him, by their own strength and force, to govern with others, and without those, which he chose to remain with him, by whose advice and consent alone he is sworn and bound to govern, I mean the great council of the nation, the Lords in Parliament assembled, the Commons in Parliament assembled, according to the constitution of the country, and to substitute against his will, and against the will of the present constituted authority of the country another authority, formed on the principles of universal suffrage and annual representation, and so formed without the authority of parliament, I must submit to the court, and to you, that conspiring to do this would be an overt act of treason of deposing the king, and therefore of compassing his death. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 84 Gentlemen, you will also observe the indictment has charged, and proof will be offered to you to make it out, that these objects were meant to be carried by force, by actual force. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 85 Gentlemen, the case, as I have hitherto represented it, is not a case aiming merely at intimidating the legislature, and inducing it by an act done, which was, according to the forms of the constitution, to bury the constitution in its grave, to new-mould the sovereign power; the case goes far beyond this; application in any shape to parliament was not only disavowed, but the very competency of parliament, if applied to, to make a law to new-model the government, was disputed, and denied; the idea of that competency was held to be irreconcilable to the very principle upon which these persons assembled. I must however insist, and I mean to doit, with the full concurrence of my bumble opinion, that a conspiracy to compel the king, by force, inst his will, to give his assent to an act obtained from the Houses of Parliament in order to alter the government and frame of the constitution of the country, whether it was obtained from the two Houses of Parliament, or either of them, by overawing them, or not overawing them,—that a conspiracy, by force, to compel the king, in the exercise of the highest and most essential act of the sovereignty of this country, in the act of giving his consent to such an act,—to compel him, by force, to do that, is unquestionably an overt act of treason in deposing him, and in compassing his death. Itis neither more nor less, to explain it in a word, than to substitute the will of those, who conspired to force him, in the room of that royal will, in which, and by which alone, the laws of this country, and the constitution of this country, have said that a bill (however obtained betore it comes to him) shall receive the authority of a statute. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 86 Gentlemen, I have thought it necessary to state thus much before I come to state the circumstances of the case, and I will state to ae in a word why. It is not to be expected yy persons, who execute the great and important duty in the great and important station, the functions of which you are now called upon to execute, that council at the bar shall be able to state to you law, that no man can question the soundness of: nay, gentlemen, it is not to be expected by you that counsel at the bar should be able to state to you in all cases law, which men of grave character, and excellent understandings, of great reason, and reat experience in their profession, may not ispute the soundness of. It is the duty of counsel, more particularly it is the duty of that counsel, who ought to remember that, if, in Pree the subject, he presses him unfairly, he Betrays in the most essential point the duty which he owes to the soveTeign: it is his duty to endeavour faithfully and honestly to explain and expound the law, that is, to apply to the facts of the particular case, reasoning upon the law, according as he is able to do it, in the exercise of painful industry, exerted under the reflection that be is under much obligation at least to endeavour to represent the law truly. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 87 Gentlemen, I have thought it my duty, in a prosccution, the principles of which interest the civil happiness of all mankind, to mention distinctly and fairly what are the principles upon which I proceed; I have no doubt in my own mind, but that I have stated these doctrines as the law of England would state them, and}I claim from you and from the public that, in the fair exercise of my duty, conducted under such a sense and understanding of that duty, as I have now explained to jou, you and they will do me the credit at leat to think, that the principles whichIhave stated are such as I believe to be sancs tioned by the law of England. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 88 Gentlemen, I shall presume for a moment, after having read to you the indictment, and given you that exposition of it, which I humbly offer to your attention, that the law has (at least, according to my judgment, it certainly has) been complied with in this respect; namely, the indictment has told you with sufficient certainty what it is, that is meant to be imputed as an overt act of com. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 89 passing the king’s death. It is not necessary to be disputing that now, because, if I have failed in the due execution of my duty in that respect, the prisoner cannot be injured by it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 90 Gentlemen, I have before said to you, that, in a case of high treason, the evidence must not only be convincing, but it must be formal ; and, though the object of the security of the person and government of the king is the highest object that the law has looked to, yet I must, at the same time, inform you, that the law for the security of the public which is in truth part of the object involved in the object of the security of the person and government of the king—is essentially united with it—and inseparable from it: the law has required not only that you shall have one witness, if he were the most credible man in the world, to give convincing evidence of the fact, but that that convincing evidence must be rendered yet more conclusive by the testimony of two witnesses; that you should at least have one witness to one overt act, and another to another overt act of the same species of treason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 91 Gentlemen, having stated to you the project, in a general way, to which I apprehend this indictment applies, I presume that you may possibly reason thus: When this indictment charges, that these persons compassed the death of the king, and to depose him,— that they conspired to assemble a convention in defiance of the authority of parliament,— to subvert the rule and government of the kingdom, against the will and in defiance of the legislature,—to dethrone the monarch, reigning in the ‘hearts of a great majority of his people, you will naturally ask,—by what Process was it, that such persons as these could effectuate such a purpose? When the indictment charges, that they composed a great variety of books, containing incitements to choose persons, as delegates, to compose a convention for such traitorous purposes,—in what language, you will naturally ask, could such incitements to such a momentous project, have been conveyed, and to whom could that language have been addressed? When it charges, that they met, and deliberated among themselves, together with divers other false traitors,—at what time, in what manner, and in what place, it may be asked, have these people met to deliberate upon that project, for the accomplishment of which somany persons must be engaged
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 92 By what means were they to bring together the subjects of the country, to send delegates to such a traitorous convention, to assume such sovereign power? This sort of question may be pursued. I shall not pursue it by observations upon every overt act in this indictment. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 93 Now, gentlemen, my answer to this isa short one. I think it will be proved to your Satisfaction, that, as they meant, in the words of the act of parliament, to introduce that system of misery and anarchy, which Prevailed in France, they meant to introduce it by the same means,—to proceed upon the same principles to the same end,—and by the same acts to execute the same purposes. Gentleinen, if the experience of Europe had not manifested what has passed in France (and this project might perhaps be brought from France into Great Britain by but an individual or two), if that experience had not shown us what has passed in France, to the destruction of its old government—to the destruction alike of that government which they substituted in the room of its old government—and which, in the last act of its Power, protested against the existence of clubs, as incompatible with the security of any country, I say, till the subversion of government in France took place, and upon principles, to a blind admiration of which in this country,—a country which, under the pee culiar favour of Providence, is alike in its blessings, as it is inits situation, ‘ toto divisos orbe Britunnos, we have found a disposition to sacrifice all those blessings—it could not perhaps have entered into the heart of man to conceive, that a project so extensive should have been set on fick by persons in number so few; that a project, existing almost every where, should yet be visible no where; that a project should be so deeply combined, and complicated,—should exist to such an almost inconceivable extent,—should be formed with so much political craft—it could not enter into the heart of man to conceive, that it should have existed in any country, much less, that it was possible that it should exist in this country of Great Britain to the extent in which I am sure, whatever your verdict may say upon the guilt of the prisoner, you will be satisfied it has existed in this country. But the law of England does not require that any such case as this should be proved before you. If you are satisfied that what the indictment charges was imagined, and that a step was taken to effectuate that intent, it is enough—it is not the extent, in which the project was proceeded upon—it is not the extent to which the project was Tuinous —it is not necessary to prove, that the Means were as competent to the end proposed, as they were thought to be, by those who used them. No, gentlemen, the providence of the law steps in upon their first motion, whether they furnish themselves with means adequate or inadequate to their purposes—the law steps in then, conceiving its rovidence at that moment to be necessary be the safety of the king and the security of the subject. The project, the general character of which I shall give you, proving it by the particular facts, and applying the particular facts (for I have no right to give you the general project, unless I can so apply the particular facts) to the person now accused, seems to me to have been this.. Imported from France in the latter end of the year 1791 or 1792, by whom brought hither : does not much matter, the intent was to constitute in London, with alliliated societies in the country, clubs which were to govern this country upon the principles of the French government, the alleged unalienable, imprescriptible rights of man, such, as they are stated to be, inconsistent in the very nature of them with the being of a king or of lords in a government—deposing, therefore, the moment they come into execution, in the act of creating a sovereign power, either mediatcly or immediately, the king, and introducing a republican government with a right of eternal reform, and thercfore with a prospect of eternat revolution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 94 Gentlemen, we have all heard of a club called the Jacobin Club at Paris. This, with its affiliated societies,—however impossible it was thought that it should effect such things, —however wild the man would have been thought, into whose head such an imagination could have entered as that it could effect them, first overset the old constitution, then introduced another, which could not exist upon the principles which gave it birth, and has finally introduced government after governmeat, till it has at last Ieft the country in that undescribable state of things in which we now see it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 95 Gentlemen, the great end of the persons concerned in this project, though not altogether visible, or not much disclosed upon its first formation, was, when they had sufliciently diffused their principles through this country, by artifice,—by union,—by combination, — by affiliation, —by fraternization (those who formed the project, whuever they were, endeavouring tu force it into execution by means which perhaps would shock the minds of men that are not always dwelling upon political subjects), to assemble a convention of delegutes from clubs, to assume the power of the people, supported in the assumption and exercise of that power by the individual members of the afhliated socicties, and by their combined strength. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 96 Gentlemen, we have no occasion in this cause to-be disputing upon abstract questions, as to the power of the people to change their government. I state to you, that the intention was, to asscmble a convention of delegates from those clubs, to assume the powers of government. The people, the infinite majority of the people adverse to any change, distinguishing between abuses in the administration of the government, and vices in the form of the government administered, nay, ardently attached to the old government, must have been averse to have been subdued by a convention of the delegates from these societies, who meant to have assumed the representation of the people, and to have exercised the powers which they stated to be inherent in those whom they professed to represent. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 97 Gentlemen, it is not difficult to conceive, after what has happened in fact in France, how it should happen that the opinion of these fraternizing societies should have the force of the will of a majority of the nation, though they constitulcd a vast and infinite minority indeed. You will tind, in the evidence to be laid before you, that it was perfectly understood how this might be by those who are named in this indictment. The great bulk of the community, engaged in different pursuits, are therefore incapable of being combined in opposition to the execution of a purpose, which is to be brought about by great bodies of men, that are combined. I need not give you a stronger instance of it than this : It is within the memory of most of us living, that a few thousand men in St. George’s-fields, combined in one purpose, reduced this metropolis to an absolute state of anarchy, a state in which no government existed. If any man had been asked, a fortnight before the event to which I am now alluding, Is it possible for four or five thousand men to assemble in St. George’s-fields, and to rob and plunder every body they choose in London and ten miles round it? That would have been thought utterly impossible—but yet it happened—why? because a combination of the few will subdue the many, who are not combined, and with great facility; and combined bodies of men have had, as you will find, an existence in this country, to an extent which few men had any idea of. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 98 You will find them organized,—prepared for emergencies and exigencies,—relying upon their own strength,—determined to act upon their combined strength, in a system of acting together,—in some instances acting with a secrecy calculated to elude observation—in other instances, procceding, by directly contrary meaus, to the same end,—representing their numbers as greater than they were, an therefore increasing their number by the very operation of the intluence of the appearance of strength upon the minds of others, without a possibility that that misrepresentation should be set right. You will find them intlaming the ignorant, under pretence of enlightening them; debauching their principles towards their country, under pretence of infusing political knowledge into them; —addressing themselves principally to those whose rights, whose interests are, in the eye uf the law and constitution of England, as valuable as those of any men, but whose education does nut enable them immediately to distinguish between political truth and the misrepresentations held out to them,—working upon the passions of men, whom Providence hath placed in the lower, but useful, and highly respectable situations of life, to irritate them against all whom its bounty hath blessed by assigning to them situations of rank and property,—representing them as their oppressors, as their enemies, as their plunderers, as those whom they should not suffer to exist; and, in order, at the same time, to shut out the possibility of correcting original error, or rectifying the opinions of those whom they had so inflamed, misinformed, debauched, and misled, not admitting them into these affiliated societies till they had subscribed tests— the principles of which they were not to examine after they bad been admitted, but the principles of which they were to carry into execution, when assembled in a convention to carry into execution those principles, as acting for the people, by a great majority of whom they were held in utter detestation. Gentlemen, to say that an act done was meant to be done as a means taken in the execution of such a project as this is, till the person, who takes it, thinks the scheme practicable, I admit is not reasonable, but -undoubtedly he may think it practicable long before it is really so. Now, you will be abundantly satisfied, that these conspirators thought that the time was now come—that the time for a convention, which had been the object of anxious expectation, doubting for a year or two whether it would ever be gratified, that that time was now come, and the measures taken were taken upon that snnposten that the Se ereny had arrived, which, if not laid hold of now, would be lost for ever. Gentlemen, the people of this country have in general a rooted attachment to its government. The public opinion of government is in this country, as well as in every other, its principal support: and therefore it became necessary to infuse, where so much could be safely suggested, where the mind was prepores for it, an opinion, thut the form of the ritish government was radically vicious— that it was-founded on principles of oppression—that it was founded on the destruction of natural, imprescriptible, and unalienable rights. —With others, you will find, they thought it necessary to use a little more cau-. tion— not to alarm them, but to humour their attachment to the form of the constitution, by taking advantage of well-meaning ignorance, under pretence of instructing it, to enlist them also alike in the project of destroying that constitution to which they were attached. To them, therefore, the form of the government was not spoken of in terms which they might understand to be a condemnation of it, though they were really such, but by making use of general expressions, such as obtaining “a full and fair representation of the people in patliament—" a full representation of the people, sometimes without mention of parliament—never with actual mention of the King and Lords, as co-existing together with parliament; by using terms, which certainly may mean what it may be contended in the defence they did mean; but terms the same in their expression, certainly the same in their import, as those which were usedin every act which passed in this country during the time of the Commonwealth, when we neither had King nor Lorde; that may signify a government existing without Lords or King, by declaring the obtaining such a representation of the people as necessary to the natural, unalienable, imprescriptible rights of man, as stated by Mr. Paine: by these means and artifices, they attempted to engage in their service the physical strength of men who might not and did not discover the real nature of the plan, which that strength was to be employed in executing; who fad not information enough to discover what the representation was meant finally todo or to execute. But you will find the persons mem tioned in this indictment had no doubt about it. I mark these circumstances to you, because, in the evidence that is to be laid before you (and I am now stating the general character of the evidence, and not the principles upon which the charge is made), in the evidence to be laid before you of the plan for the execution of these purposes, some very rematkable particulars occur; and when you eome to decide upon this case, I humbly hes your attention to those particulars; some very remarkable particulars will occur. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 99 You will find that the ledding clubs, by which I mean the Constitutional Society, judging of its conduct for the purpose of this cause, though in some other cases we must go farther back, but, for the purpose of this cause, judging of its conduct from about the beginning of the year 1792, and the London Corresponding Society, which was formed, whether created, I will not say, but which was modelled by some leading members of the Constitutional Society, and received its corporate existence, if I may use the term, as it will be proved, under their own handwriting; most distinctly from the handwriting of some, who yet belong, and some, who have ceased to belong to the Constitutional Society; these leading societies, you will find, enlisting into their affiliation many societies in the country, composed of men who expressed their doubts as to the views of these societies in London; who expressed their fears as well as their doubts about those views; who required information as to the purposes of those societies in London; some of these societies in the country professing one set of principles, some another; but al assistance is taken that is offered: accordingly you will see, that the London societies enlist persons who profess, “ that they ought to submit to no power but what they have themselves immediately constituted: to these they give answers, couched in dark, cautious, prudent, but satisfactory and intelligible terms: those who profess still to have attachments to the monarchy of the country, and who express apprehensions about its safety from the principles of the London societies, and the conflicting principles of various country societies, they sooth into fraternization, by telling them that all would be set right “ by a full and fair representation of the people in parliament ;—a name which was given to the uy 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 100 Commons under Cromwell, as well as to the legitimate parliaments of this country at different periods,—without telling them either what these words meant, or how that parliament was to operate to reconcile these differences, which you will find amounted only to the differences between an attachment to an absolute republic, and an attachment to a limited monarchy. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 101 They enlist alike those, who expressed a wish to know whether they proposed to reform the House of Commons, and those who wished to know whether they intend to rip up monarchy by the roots ; their answers were calculated to satisfy each of them, to satisfy whatever might be the disposition of those, who address the questions to them, eee information upon subjects so totally different. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 102 Gentlemen, this is not all: you will find again, that for these purposes, publicationsupon the government of the country, which are alluded to in this indictment, and which will he given to youin evidence, that publications upon the government of the country were adopted by those societies as their own, and circulated, if I may so express myself, ina mass round the country, circulated in a manner, that totally destroys the liberty of the press in this country
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 103 The liberty of the press in this country never vught to be under an undue correction of the law, but it must always be, for the sake of the people, subject to the correction of the law: you will find that these publications are either brought into the world with such a secrecy as baffles all prosecution,—published without names of authors or of printers,—published by contrivance, I am sorry to say by contrivance published in the dead of night (though they are the works of men who have talents to state them to open day, if fit to be stated to open day), and published in quantities, which make theapplication of the wholesome provisions of the law utterly incompetent to the purpose of allowing the correction of the law to beas frequent as the commission of the offences against it has been. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 104 Gentlemen, with respect to many of these pobliations 1 may take notice of what has happened in the history of this country, and though no man wishes less to talk of himself than I do, yet I am speaking in the presence of many, who have heard me both in court and in parliament respecting those publications to which I allude (aiid which will be offered to you in evidence), express the difficulty that my mind laboured under to concede that such a publication as the Address to the Addressers, was not, according to law, an overt act of high treason
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 105 It did appear to me that the fublication of the book called the Address to the Addressors was an overt act of high treason, for the purpose of deposing the king; at least I thought it required an ingenuity and subtlety, much beyond that which belonged to was not so; but there were reasons satisfac. tory to those who can judge better than I can and therefore that book was treated only as a libel : but when I come to see it, as connected with the mass of publications alluded to in this indictment,—as connected with measures that I have to state to you in the course of opening this cause,—and as connected with the project which this indictment imputes to depose the king, I say it is either most distinct evidence of an overt act of high peasany or itis an overt act of high treason itself. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 106 Gentlemen, you will also not fail to observe (and I state it as a general feature and charaeter of the evidence that I have to lay before you)—the malignant art, and if I may so express myself, the industrious malignity, with which discontent has been spread by these two societies in London, and the means of spreading it have been studiously and anxiously taught from society to society: the means of spreading sedition, fresh as from London, in every town, all with reference (for they are not material, if you do not find they had such a reference) to the final accomplishment of the same purpose: you will not fail to observe how the passions and interests of individuals have becn assailed, and the method of assailing them taught, according to their stations in life—not merely upon government, —but, for the purpose of subverting government, upon tithes—corn-bills—taxes—gamelaws—impress service—any thing that could be represented as a grievance, as well as the government itself, and to this intent—that, in aid and assistance of each other, societies, as they expressed it, ‘might overspread the whole face of the island, and “ that the island might become free —you will mark their expressions—“ by the same means by which France became so. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 107 Gentlemen, in stating to you the character of the evidence, it is necessary for me to make one observation, and it is the last I shall trou ble you with: it is with respect to the principles upon which construction is to be given to the written evidence that will be adduced in this cause. Now I desire to state this to your minds as a principle perfectly reasonable in the administration of justice towards men, who are called upon to answer for offences that the language which they use, ought to be considered according to its obvious sense. If the language admits, and naturally admits, of a double interpretation, it must then be considered according to the nature of the principle which that language is calculated to carry into execution; each paper must be considered with reference to the context of the same paper, and with reference to the contents of all other papers that form the evidence of the same system, which the paper produced is meant to prove. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 108 Now, if you shoyld find that, in detailing the objects of this society, in detailing when my mind, to state satisfactory reasons why itthey meant to do, and in detailing how they meant to execute what they purposed, they should in fact have stated that they meant neither that which was legal,—nor that which was constitutional,—nor that which was other than treason, it will be in vain that they have thought fit (for the greater prudence, the greater care, and the greater caution which you will have most abundant evidence to prove wey exercised occasionally, but add to the guilt by increasing the danger) to assert at other times, when they have used general language, that what they meant to effect was legal and that they meant to effect it ina legal and constitutional manner. It will become them who have the defence upon their hands, to state to you how, ina legal and constitutional manner those things could be done, which were intended to be done, and which this indictment states were intended to be done, if I prove to your satisfaction that they were intended to be done by the means and instruments, which the indictment refers ado. Gentlemen of the jury, their principle, as you will find, was, that equal active citizenship is the right of all men, and that upon this principle their representation of the people wasto be asked for. Now, it requires no reasoning to state, that a representation of the people founded upon the principle of equal active citizenship of all men, must form a parliament into which no King, nor Lords, could enter. There is an end of equal active citizenship the moment that either of them exists, according to my construction of equal active citizenship, and according to their construction of it; for they state that the effect of itis a representative government. But it is not enough for me to tell you, that, in reasoning, this is the consequence; it is a circumstance to be taken into your consideration ; but I say I shall satisfy you, if 1am bound to go farther, that the application of the principle of equal active citizenship, according to them, was to be the foundation of a representative government, rejecting the King and Lords out of the system. The principles were the principles upon which the constitution of France, in the year 1791, was formed: the principles of that constitution were the principles of equal active citizenship: they attempted indeed to provers a king in the constitution, and to form what I may call a royal democracy: but I shall prove to demonstration, that the leaders of these clubs in London knew that that constitution could not exist, that their principles led them to a distinct knowledge that that constitution could not exist: it was in the month of August 1792 entirely overturned; and you will find from the transactions of this society in the months of October and November 1792, unless I mistake the effect of the evidence, the clearest demonstration that these societies meant in applying those principles, which they themselves state had destroyed the existence of a king in France, because they must destroy the existence of a king in any country,—you will find that, from October 1792 at least, these societies meant to destroy the king in this country, and that this was the natural effect of their own principles, as they understood them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 109 Gentlemen, you will now give me leave to state to you, as wellas I can, and as intelligibly as I can, the mass of evidence, and the case which I have to lay before vou. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 110 The particular act, the nature of which will be to be explained by all the rest of the evidence, which has led to the including these particular persons in one indictment, arose out of a letter, dated the 27th of March 1794, which was written by the prisoner, then the secretary of the London Corresponding Society, to the society for Constitutional Information. The words of it are these : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 111 “ I am directed by the London Corresponding Society to transmit the following resolutions to the Society for Constitutional Information, and to request the sentiments of that society respecting the important measures which the present juncture of affairs seems to require. The London Corresponding Society conceives that the moment is arrived — mark the words; for, in the rest of what I have to state, you will frequently hear of the time to which that allen when a full and explicit declaration is necessary from all the friends of freedom, whether the late illegal and unheard of prosecutions and sentences shall determine us to abandon our cause, or shall excite us to pursue a radical reform with an ardour proportionale to the magnitude of the object, and with a zeal as distinguished on our part as the treachery of others in the same glorious cause is notorious. The Society for Constitutional Information is therefore ree quired to determine whether or no they will be ready, when called upon, to act in conjunction with this and other societies, to obtain a fair representation of the people. Gentlemen, give me your attention presently to what they conceive to be a fair representation of the people, when I come to state the resolutions which they transmit! “ Whether they concur with us in seeing the necessity of a speedy Convention for the purpose of obtaining, (then they use the words), “ in a constitutional and legal method—of the effect of which you will judge presently, for the method will not be the more constitutional and legal for their calling it so, if the method is in fact unconstitutional and illegal—“ a redress of those grievances under which we at present labour, and which can only be effectually removed by a full and fair representation of the people of Great Britain. ‘fhe London Corresponding Soeiety cannot but remind their friends that the present crisis demands all the prudence, .unanimity, and vigour, that ever may or can be exerted by men or Britons; nor do they doubt but that manly firmness and consistency will finally, and they believe shortly, terminate in the full accomplishment of all their wishes, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 112 They then resolve, and these resolutions are enclosed: “ 1st, That dear as justice and liberty are to Britons, yet the value of them is comparatively small without a dependance on their permanency, and there can be no security for the continuance of any rights but in equal laws. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 113 “ 9d, That equal laws can never be expected but by a full and fair representation of the people ; to obtain which, in the way pointed out by the constitution,—you will see what that is in the third resolution—“ has been and is the sole object of this society ; for this we are ready to hazard every thing, and never but with our lives will we relinquish an object which involves the happiness, or even the political existence of oursclves and posterity. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 114 “ rd, That it is the decided opinion of this society, that, to secure ourselves from the future illegal and scandalous prosecutions, to prevent a repetition of wicked and unjust sentences, and to recall those wise and wholesome laws which have been wrested from us, and of which scarcely a vestige remains.— Gentlemen. you will permit me to call your attention to what the cuiects were which were to be accomplished—“ there ought to be immediately,—what
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 115 " a convention of the peri by delegates deputed for that purpose oy aks different societies of the friends of free
ATTORNEYGENERAL 116 ? And what are the purposes which this convention, which they themselves represent as a convention of the people, are to execute? Why they, the delegates, forming a convention of the people, are to recall those wise, wholesome laws, which they say have been wrested from them. Before I have done, I shall prove distinctly that this iy the meaning of the passage, and the meaning of the passage will be to be collected from the whole of the evidence undoubtedly, not from this particular part of it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 117 The Constitutional Society, there being present at that time six of the persons mentioned in this indictment, without any deliberation whatever upon a proposition so material as this is—and therefore it must be left to you, upon the whole of the evidence, whether it is fairly to be inferred or not, that this, like a-great many other papers of the London Corresponding Society, really came from the Constitutional Society—they immediately ordered that their secretary shall acquaint the London Corresponding Society, that they had teceived their communication, that they heartily concur with them in the objects they have in view, and that for that view, and for the purpose of a more speedy and effectual co-operation, they invite them to send to this society, next Friday evening, a delegation of some of their members. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 118 Without now going into the particulars of what followed upon this, give me leave to state, that some members of the society, included in this indictment, were named to compose that delegation; that there was named at the same time a Committee of Correspondenee of six members of this society; that afterwards the London Sareronding Society formed another cemmittee ; t two committees met; that the two committees meeting, came to a determination that this project of calling a convention of the people should be carried into effect; and then, that a joint committee of co-operation of both societies was formed by resolutions of both. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 119 Having stated what happened upon the 27th of March 1794, and connecting it, as I shall do presently, with the very singular facts, which you will find also happened in that year, you will give me leave, in order to show what the true construction of this act is, as well as to state the nds upon which the indictment, even without this act, charges a conspiracy to depose the king—you will give me leave to state the transactions of these societies from the month of Mareh 1792. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 120 Gentlemen, in or about the month of March 1792,—whether before that time the Londoa Corresponding Society had existed oF not, seems to me to be dubious, and therefore I will make no assertion of that one way or other; but supposing it to have existed, it will be made extremely clear that this suciety existed at that time without a constitution, as they call it, and was indebted te a gentleman of the name of Tooke for the constitution under which the society was modified, and was indebted, I think, to a gentleman of the name of Vaughan, for his assistance in the composition of the code of its laws. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 121 The first correspondence that I find between the Constitutional Society, and the London Corresponding Society, which I have to state to you, is in the communication of the principles of the Corresponding Society, sent with a letter signed by the prisoner at the bar, which letter is in the following words: “I am ordered by the committee to send to the Society for Constitutional Information in London a copy of our motives for associating, and the eeohutions we have come to: we mean to persevere in the cause we have embarked in, that is, to have (if possible) an equal representation of the people of this nation in pare liament. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 122 I observe here for a moment that you will not be surprised, when I get to the conclusion of this business, that this cautious language was used in the outset: it will be for you to judge whether a studied caution is fairly imputable to the language. It proceeds thus: ‘We should be exceedingly happy to enter into a correspondence with that sdciety, if it is not too much presumption in us to expect such an honour; but, as our cause is one, we hope that they will deign to take some notice of us, who are now entering upon a matter of such vast importance. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 123 This is extremely condescending language on the part of Mr. Hardy te the Constitutional Society ;‘it accompanies the resolutions of that society, which resolutions purported to be signed “ Thomas Hardy, secretary. It happened, by an accident not very easy to be accounted for at present, and, notwithstanding which, I shall prove distinctly to you that the resolutions are the act of Mr. Hardy: thet this signature—“ Thomas Hardy, secretary — ie a signature, as I am instructed, in the hand-writing of Mr. Horne Tooke; that is, Mr. Hardy in the London Corresponding Society, sends the resolutions of the London Corresponding Society (apologizing extremely for the liberty he takes in presuming to send them) to the Constitutional Society, the sigNature to those resolutions bearing the name of Thomas Hardy in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke: whether those resolutions were finally settled by that gentleman or not, I do not knew ; but you will find that there exists a paper which contains, I think, distinct evidence upon the face of it, that those resolutions have been settled, with a deal of deliberation, by the same gentleman whose hand-writing occurs in the signature which I have been stating. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 124 Gentlemen, before these resolutions were sent, and before I state the matter of them to you, you will allow me to mention that there ad been a correspondence between other svcieties, and the Society for Constitutional Information, of such a nature, as, in order to make this case intelligible, will require some observations from me, and some attention from you; itis the correspondence of other societies, but which correspondence I shall connect in such a manner with the London Corresponding Society, as in fact to make the acts of the other societies the acts of that society. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 125 Upon the 23rd of March 1792, with a view to show you what were the principles of this Constitutional Society, I must state, that they come to a resolution, hat the thanks of this society be given to Mr. Thomas Paine, for his most masterly book intituled, The Rights of Man, in which not only the malevolent soplistries of hireling scribblers are detected, and exposed to merited ridicule, but many of the most important and beneficial political truths are stated so irresistibly convincing as to promise the acceleration of that not very distant period, when usurping borough-sellers and protligate borough-buyers shall be deprived of what they impudently dare to call their Propertyethe choice of the representatives of the people. The Constitutional Socicty cannot help expressing their satisfaction that so valuable a publication has Proceeded trom a member of that society, and they sincerely hope, that the people of England val give that attention to the subjects. discussed in Mr. Paine’s treatise, which their manitest importance so justly deserves. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 126 Then they resolved, for what purpose you will judge of, when I come to state to you the subsequent evidence in this business—“ That the foregoing resolutions, and all future proceedings of this society, be regularly transmitted by the secretary to all our corresponding constitutional societies in England, Seotland, and France. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 127 Now, gentlemen, as I shall prove what the book was to which this resohition alluded, I shall take the liberty at present to state in a few words to you, as far as they affect the existenee of a king in this country, those subjects, which, according to the language of this resolution, the Constitutional Society sincerely hope that the people of land would give attention to, as discussed in Mr. Paine’s first book. In that book these doctrines, with respect to Great Britain, are laid down: “a constitution is not a thing in name only, but in fact; it has not an ideal, but a real existence ; and you will find this extremely imt, because in the result of the whole evidence that I have to lay before you, it will appear that they did not only distinctly disavow making any application to parliament, but the competence of parliament to de any thing by way of reform, because the country had as yet no constitution formed by the people. Mr. Paine proceeds: “Can Mr. Burke produce the English constitution? If he cannot, we may fairly conclude that no such thing as a constitution exists. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 128 After stating that the septennial bill showed that there was no such thing as a constitution in England, the book states a farther fact, not immaterial, that the bill which Mr. Pitt brought into parliament some years ago to reform parliament, was upon the same erToneous principle, that is, upon the principle that patliataene was able to reform itself. With respect to other subjects, to which the attention of the people of England wascalled, you will find that this book, speaking of modes of government (and this is also extremely material with reference to the construction of what is afterwards to be stated to you), represents that “the two modes of government which prevail in the world are, frst, governments by election and representation ; secondly, governments by hereditary succession: the former is generally known by the name of republican, the latter by that of monarchy and aristocracy. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 129 He divides government into government by election and representation; a representation founded upon election, and election founded upon universal suffrage; and government by hereditary succession. He then states that, from the revolutions of America and France, and the symptoms that have appeared in other countries, it is evident the opinion of the world is changing with respect to government, and that revolutions are not within the progress of political calculation; and that the British government, not existing upon the principles he recommends, is not a government existing upon such principles that a nation ought to submit to-it; and that the liament of the country is not able to form a government, that will exist upon those pripciples. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 130 Gentlemen, it is a very remarkable circumstance, as it strikes me, that, though various societies had existed in other parts of Great Britain, till about the time of the formation of the London Corresponding Society, none of these societies had asked or invited affiliation with the London Constitutional Society, which you will find they all ask and all invite about March 1792, whether by management or not, I do not pretend to determine, it will be for you to judge; but they all ask and all invite affiliation with the Constitutional and Corresponding Societies, as soon as the latter is formed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 131 Upon the 16th of March 1792, you will find a resolution of the society for Constitutional Information, which states and returns thanks fora communication from Manchester, signed “ Thomas Walker, president, and “Samuel Jackson, secretary ; in which they return the thanks of the society to Mr. Thomas Paine, who appears to have been aa member, a visitor of this Constitutional Society, “ for the publication of his Second Part of the Rights of Man, combining Principle and Practice. I shall endeavour to state to you in a few words what is the combination of the practice stated in the Second Part of the Rights of Man, with the Lib in the First Part, “a work, they say, “ of the highest importance to every nation under heaven, but particularly this, as containing excellent and practicable plans for an immediate and considerable reduction of the public expendigure for the prevention of wars, for the extension of our manufactures and commerce, for the education of the young, for the comfortable support of the aged, for the better maintenance of the poor of every description, and, finally, for lessening, greatly, and without delay, the enormous load of taxes, under which this country at present labours. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 132 “ That this society congratulate their country at large on the influence which Mr. Paine's publications appear to have had in procuring the repeal of some oppressive taxes in the present session of parliament ; and they hope that this adoption of a small part of Mr. Paine’s ideas will be followed by the most strenuous exertions to accomplish a complete reform in the present inadequate state of the representation of the people, and that the other pest plans of public benefit, which Mr. Paine has so powerfully recommended, will be speedily carried into effect. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 133 ow, gentlemen, as Mr. Paine’s plan for the remedy of the present inadequate state of the representation of the people was alluded to, and this book was alloted to, which combined “ principle and “ practice, and as it is stated that the other great plans of public benefit, which he had so powerfully recommended, would be speedily carried into effect, it will be necessary to show you, from this letter, what were those plans for the remedy of the inadequate state of the representation of the people, and other plans of public benefit, which this society, recciving the thanks of the Constitutional Society, hoped would be carried into effect. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 134 Gentlemen, I do not take up your time in stating the passages to you, but represent to you the substance of that book; that itis a k distinctly and means recommending the deposition of the king : if the passages in that book do not prove that assertion, there is no evidence that can prove any assertion : it is a book, moreover, which not only puts the king out of the system of the government of the country, but, according to which, if'a perfect representation of the people is to be formed, it 1s to be formed not by a parliament existing in a country—in which that gentleman states that no constitution exists—not by that parliament, which he states to be totally aud a solutely inadequate to the great work of forming the constitution upon the nights of man and equal active citizenship, which he recommends: it is a work, which calls upon the people of England to do themselves justice in another way of proceeding, and to form a constitution for themselves before they can have any government, which is to exist upon true principles. There is then, I say, in the beginning of this thing, a developement of these purposes; and I say, beyond that, that if I understand the effect of evidence at all, I shall satisfy you that those, who voted this resolution of thanks, knew that the principles there referred to, were principles that would have this operation, and meant that they should have this effect. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 135 The next thing I have to state, which I shall not go through very particularly, is contained in a resolution of the Constitutional Society (some of the members of which, I shall prove to you, began to leave the society about this time, stating distinctly that they understood its principles to be now different from the principles it had formerly acted upon, and to be such principles as I have stated) entered into upon the 23rd of March 1792. They resolved that another communication, which is from Sheffield, should be published in the Morning Chronicle, and in several other newspapers, which they, mention. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 136 With respect to the communication from Sheffield (and it is a remarkable thing that, from Shefteld, and from Norwich, they should be writing, on the same day, for the same urpose—that the societies of Sheffield and Nomick might be affiliated with the London Constitutional Society, and the Sheffield peo ple were so anxious about it, if it were their own act and deed, that they wrote more than ope letter in order to ask it), it is to this ef ect: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 137 “ Itis now about four months since this society first formed itself into a regular body 5 they were then but very few in number; the encleeed will inform you of their increase, and, which is most probable, will soon become very numerous ; and not only this large and populous tewn, but the whole neighbourfor many miles round about, have an attentive eve upon us: most of the towns and villages indeed are forming themselves into similar associations, and strictly adhere to the mode of copying after us: you will easily conceive the necessity for the leading members of this body to pay strict attention to good order and regularity, and the need we have of consulting and communicating with those who are sincere friends and able advocates for the same cause ; for these reasons we took the liberty to write to Mr. Horne Tooke, that worthy friend and patriot for the rights of the people, informing him of our earnest desire of entering into connexion with the society of the same denomination of ours in London; his very obliging and affectionate answer favours us with your address; in consequence, we have taken the liberty herewith to transmit to yu some resolves, which were passed at our last meetings by the whole body, and the committee was charged with the dispatch of panne and forwarding them to you accordingly, for the purpose of submitting them to the consideration of your society, and to make use of them as they think most prudent. You will also notice the Belpar address: they applied to us about two months ago for instructions as to our mode of conducting, &c. had not then formed themselves into any regular association. Belpar is nearly thirty miles from this place, in Derbyshire, and eight or ten miles from Derby. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 138 “ If the society for Constitutional Information in London should vouchsafe so far to notice us, as to enter into a connexion and correspondence with us, it cannot fail of proMoting honour, and adding strength to our feeble endeavours, and to the common cause, which is the entire motive we have in view. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 139 They then, upon the 14th of March, 1792, knowing that there was a connexion between the London Constitutional and London Corresponding Society (and that they should know that fact on the 14th of March, which is sixteen days before the Soth, when Mr. Hardy sent to Mr. Tooke the resolutions which were signed in the name of Mr. Hardy by Mr. Tooke, as a communication to him that there was such a body as the London Corresponding Society, is a circumstance that affords observation); they then add, “ We have taken the liberty of enclosing a parcel for Mr. Hardy, in answer to a letter from him to this society, requesting some information concerning our method of conducting the business we had embarked in, &c. also informing us there are in London a number of mechanics, shopkeepers, &c. forming themselves into a society on the broad basis of the rights of man. You will be so obliging as to let the packet remain with you until he call for it, as by this post I have wrote him thereof. We have given him our manner of proceeding from our setting out to this time, and hope it may be of some use. The improvement we are about to adopt is certainly. the best for managing large bodies, as in great and populous towns, viz. dividing them Into small bodies or meetings of ten persons each, and these ten to appoint a delegate; ten of these delegates form another meeting and so on, delegating from one to another, till at last they are reduced to a proper number for constituting the committee or grand council. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 140 There is another letter of the same date, which has a remarkable circumstance about it. It is addressed to the Constitutional Society. gentlemen, it states that “ this soe ciety, that is, the same Sheffield Society, “ feeling, as they do, the grievous effects of the present state defects and abuse of our country, —(the word originally in this letter was cone stitution, but the word constitution, not bein, that which was liked, by some very odd accident in the letter from Sheffield, the word country, in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke, is substituted for constitution )—“ the great and heavy oppressions, which the common people labour under, as the natural consequence of that corruption, and at the time being sensible to a degree of certainty, that the public minds and the general sentiments of the ple are determined to obtain a radical reform of the country, you will mark these roe “ as soon ag prudence and discretion wil. permit, believes it their duty to make use of every prudent means, as far as their abilities can be extended, to obtain so salutary and desirable an object, as a thorough reformation of our country, the word country being again in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke, “ estas blished upon that system, which is consistent with the rights of man,’—for these reasons they state their forming into clubs, as the former letter did, and they conclude thus— “ that being thus strengthened, this rromck 4 may be better enabled to govern itself wit! more propriety, and to render assistance to their fellow-citizens in this neighbourhood, and in parts more remote, that they in their turn may extend useful knowledge still farther from town to village, and from village to town, until the whole nation be sufficiently enlightened and united in the same cause, which cannot fail of being the case, wherever the most excellent works of Mr. Thomas Paine find residence. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 141 Those works are the works which hava held an hereditary monarchy, however limited, to be inconsistent with the rights of man; which have held the constitution of parliament in this country to be inconsistent with the rights of man; and those works, upon the principles of that inconsistency, have held even the parliament itself incompetent to reform any abuses in government. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 142 The paper they transmit states as a fact, that the number of members at Shefficld were, in March 1792, two thousand. -That the Constitutional Society in London and the Constitutional Society at Sheffield, thus numerous, should have had no connexion by affiliation till the 14th of March, 1792, though, on that 14th of March, 1792, it appears that the Sheffield Society had had correspondence, and had become connected with the London Corresponding Society, prior to the London Corresponding Sucicty sendin the paper I before stated to the Constitutional Society, is somewhat remarkable. The paper proceeds thus: “ This society, om are chiefly of the manufacturers of s 1d, began about four months ago, and is already increased to nearly two thousand members. In this letter, dated March 14, 1792, they state it to have amounted to two thousand, exclusive of neighhouring towns and villages, who were forming themselves into similar societies. They then state the principles upon which the societies are formed, and that “ they have derived more true knowledge from the two works of Mr. Themas Paine, intituled Rights of Man, Part the First and Second, than from any other author on the subject. The tice as well as the principle of government is laid down in those works, in a mannet so clear and irresistibly convincing, that this society do hereby resolve to give their thanks to Mr. Paine for his two said publications intituled Rights of Man. Gentlemen, I beg your pardon for addressing you so much at length on this case, but I feel it my bounden duty to the public, to you, and to the prisoner at the bar, to warn you fully of the whole of it. There is nothing which, I am sure, would more certainly happen, than that I should go, not only out of this court, but to my grave, with pain, if I should have stated to you in a proceeding of this nature the doctrines of Mr. Paine, otherwise than as I think of them. If that is meant to be intimated, that we may have no dispute about them, and that we may not misunderstand what is that principle, and that practice, to which the passage I have now read alludes, you will allow me to read a few passages out of this second part of the Rights of Man, said to contain both the principleiand practice of government, and then I ask you what those must have intended, with respect to the government of this country, who meant to take any step in order to make a change in it, in such a way as the principle and practice laid down in that book would require them to make it, recollecting that the government of this country is a government consisting in a king, having an hereditary crown, together with Lords and Commons, forming a parliament according to the laws and constitution of England. Now, that author, in the first place, expresses a great deal of what possibly may be differently thought of by other persons, but what I cannot call good-will to the people of England—for he says, “ that during the time of the American war, he was strongly impressed with the idea, that if he could cet over to England without being known, and only remain in safety till he could out 8 publication, that he could open the eyes of the country with respect to the madness and stupidity of its government. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 143 Let us see in what that madness consisted according to him: having stated in his former book that a government ought to exist in no country, but according to the principles of the rights of man—he re again the distinction he had stated in his former book, between what he calls the two systems: he says, ‘“ that the one now called the okd is hereditary, either in whole or in part, which is that of England; and the new is entirely repregentative,—that is,.a government consisting of a Commons House, if you choose so to call it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 144 We know, that in 1649 the ruling government in this country was called a parliament, called a Commons Huuse, and it was then enacted, that if any persons should attempt to put a king into this country, they boul be deemed traitors, with much less of an overt act manifested than is necessary st this day. Again, it is stated, “ an heritable crown, or an heritable throne, or by what ever fanciful name such things may be called, have no other significant explanation than that mankind are heritable property. To inherit a government, is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 145 “ Hereditary successionis a burlesque upon monarchy. It puts it in the most ndiculous light by presenting it as an office, which any child or idiot may fill. It requires some talents to be a olan Lise i to be a king requires only the animal figure of man, i ant of ireatlinns autumaton. This sort of superstition may last a few years more, but it cannot long resist the awakened reason and interest of man ; then, “ in whatever manner the separate parts of a constitution may be arranged, there is one general principle, that distinguishes freedom from slavery, which is, that all hereditary government over a people is to them a species of slavery, and representative government is freedom ; then, speaking of the crown of England, that crown, in which, according to the law and constitution of this country, aecording to its principle and practice, is vested the sovereignty in the manner in which I have stated it, he says, “ having thus glanced at some of the defects of the two Houses of Parliament, I procced to what is called the crown, upon which I shall be very concise. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 146 “It signifies a nominal office of a million sterling a year
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 147 Again, gentlemen, give me leave to observe that this, which has been so often detailed for the worst of purposes, canhot but be known to those who know any thing of the constitution of the country—I charge nobody else—those who know any thing of the constitution—I charge not those who do not know it)—to be in substance a gross misrepresentation—“ the business of which consists in receiving the money. Whether the person be wise or foolish, sane or insane, a native or a foreigner, matters not. Every minister acts upon the same idea that Mr. Burke writes, namely, that the people must be hoodwinked, and held in superstitious ignorance by some bugbear or other; and what is called the crown answers this purpose, and therefore it answers all the purposes to be expected from it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 148 Gentlemen, in another part of this work, you will find that Mr. Paine was very well aware of what these Sheftield correspondents were aware of, if they were the composers of the letter to which I have alluded; that the rinciples, laid down in the constitution ofrance, which these two books were to re-commend, and the principles, stated in: Paioe’s first book, were absolutely inconsistent with the constitution itself of France, as it existed at that moment; and Paine propheti-cally (he would not have had common sense if he had stated it otherwise), even in thebeginning of 1792, when he publishes this ; book, foretells that the government of France, with a king a part of it, upon his principles, ; and the ‘principles professed by the constitution of France, could not exist: he foresawshat in August 1792; and I will prove, that persons, who were thus approving the rinciples and practice of Paine, new that a ing could not exist consistently with those ; principles ; and they adopted them therefore, ; as we insist, in order that a king should not -exist in this country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 149 Gentlemen, these resolutions being received perhaps from Sheffield, a step is taken upon them in the Constitutional Society, and & step, which gives an authenticity to the. book I have in my hand, namely, the book of ; their proceedings, whichis remarkable enough; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 150 for in this society’s book there are these resofutions, which are supposed to be received from Sheffield, watered to the book ; and then with a view of 2 publication of them, in the ong Chronicle, World, Post, Times, Argus, English Chronicle, and General Evening Post, for the purpose of cireulating the principles of Mr. Thomas Paine, and for the purpose of circulating the representation, which is made in these resolutions, there is first of all, in Mr. Tooke’s hand-writing,— “ Society for Constitutional Information, London, March 23rd, 1792. This Society having weceived the following and other communications from Sheffield, vi2
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 151 his hand-writing— then,“ March 14th, 1792,—his hand-writing then the words “two thousand members, scored under, I cannot say by him, but by somebody, I suppose for the purpose of being printed in italics; and there is at the conclusion of this minute in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke, That the seeretary do return the thanks of this Society to the Society for Constitutional Information established at Sheffield, and that he express to them with what friendship and affection this society embraces them, as brothers aud Jellow-tabeteress in the same cause ;—of principle and practice I suppose. “ That he do assure them of our entire concurrence with their opinion, viz. that the people of this country are not, as Mr. Burke terms them, swine ; the writer of this must have known very well the sense in which an improper word, I readily admit, was used by the person to whom he now alludes,—but rational beings, better qualified to separate truth from error than himself, possessing more honesty, and less craft. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 152 “ Resolved, that this society will on Friday next, March 31st, ballot for the twelve associated members recommended by the Sheffield committee, and approved at this meeting
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 153  Then this paper 1s thus ordered to be published for the primary purpose, I submit, of recommending that principle and practice, which makes the Sheffield people “ tellowlabourers with the Constitutional Society in the same cause of principle and practice, and which, both in the principle and practice, was aimed at the destruction of the government of the country; of that hereditary monarchy, which Paine represents as tyranny; of limited monarchy, which he represents as tyranny ; and for the purpose of recommending that representative government, which, I say, is the true sense of all the words which these people use: but this is not all—you will observe, that this paper of resolutions was accompanied by a letter, in which letter there is also the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke, and that the paper states that two thousan members belong to the society at Sheflield, and that this number is to be stated by publication, as the number of persons belonging to the society at Sheffield. In another publication they are stated to amount to two : thousand four hundred—in November 1793, it is stated, that they were many thousands : now you will see from the witnesses, some of these correspondents, these able men, who are so little corrupt, in the course of examination—you will see, unless I am mistaken in the effect of the evidence I have to offer, the truth of an observation that I made, that mankind were to be misled, and societies were to be invited to be created, by the misrepresentation of numbers, and by giving to existing societies a colour in that respect, which did not belong to them; for to this hour, after all the pains which have been taken with the Sheffield people (and what pains you will hear), those persons, who were two thousand, have yet arrived to but about six hundred. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 154 Gentlemen, this society, having in this letter expressed an inclination that they should have some associated members in the Constitutional Society, that affiliation begins in the Constitutional Socicty in London, which I have alluded to; and accordingly you will find, that upon the 31st of March, twelve persons were ballotted for as from the Sheffield Society, and became associated members of this society; you observe, that this letter had stated from Sheffield that they had received before a communication from Mr. Tooke, and Mr. Tooke afterwards writes a draught of a letter which is sent to them, in which he states, “I am directed by the Society for Constitutional Information to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, and to express to you that very great pleasure and satistaction which they received from your communication; the society have unanimously elected twelve (here follow the names of the persons), “ as associated msmbers of this society.’—These persons being certainly, gentlemen, extremely respectable men as subjects of Great Britain, but at the Same time men, that one wonders a little should, upon such a purpose as this, without a little more instruction being infused into their minds, have been associated as members into this society—“ and we flatter ourselves, that when any business or other occasion shall lead any of those gentlemen to London, they will be kind enough to honour the society by their presence, and give us an opportunity of cementing that friendship between us, which all the zealous friends of public freedom and the happiness of mankind ought to feel and exercise towards each other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 155 “P.S. I am desired, by Mr. Horne Tooke, to request each of the associated members to honour him by the acceptance of the books which accompany this letter ;—which were, I apprehend it appears, so many parts of the Rights of Man. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 156 Gentlemen, upon the 24th of March 1792, a paper apeears to have been sent to the Constitutional Society from a nest of societies, the United Constitutional Societies at Norwich: this was the 24th of March 1792, and it appears, as I am instructed, that the words “24th March 1792, are also in the handwriting of Mr. Tooke. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 157 “At a meeting of the delegates of the United Constitutional Societies, held the 24th March 1799, at the Wheel-of Fortune, St. Edmund's in the city of Norwich, it was unanimously agreed to communicate to the gentlemen of the London Society for ConstiPa Information, the following Resoluions: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 158 “ 1st. We are happy to see the success of the Sheffield Society for Constitutional Reform, and approve of the delegations, which you and they have made in order to form a plan of general information. We humbly eg that you would grant to us the same favour ; and it is our wish, that all the Societies of a similar kind in England were only as so many members strongly and indissolubly united in one political body. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 159 “Secondly. We believe that instructing the people in political knowledge, and in their only effectual way to oblain the grand object of reform, for men need only be made acquainted with the abuses of government, and natural and inherent rights as men, is the they will readily jom in every lawfat means to obtain redress; we havethe pleasure to inform you that our societies consist of some hun dreds, and new societies are frequently forming, which, by delegates, preserve a mutual intercourse with each other, for mutual instruction and information; and the greatest care has been taken to preserve order and regularity at our meetings, to convince the world that riot and disorder are no parts of our political creed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 160 “ 8dly. We believe, and are firmly oe suaded (and if any man thought so, he had a right to say so if he pleased), “that Mr. Burke, the once friend of liberty, has traduced the greatest and most glorious revolution ever recorded in the annals of history; we thank Mr. Burke for the political discussion provoked and by which he has opened unto us the dawn of a glorious day. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 161 “ 4thly. To Mr. Thomas Paine our thanks are especially due for the First and Second parts of the Rights of Man, and we sincerely wish that he may live to see his labours— that is, the destruction of hereditary government and limited monarchy, and consequeath the government of England—“ crowned wi success in the general diffusion of liberty and happiness among mankind. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 162 Gentlemen this letter does not appear (though the words, the 24th of Mareh, are in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke) to have been read in the Constitutional Society till the 14th of May 1792, when they read this letter, and also another, which I will now state to you, from the society called the Norwich Revolution Seciety. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 163 “ The Norwich Revolution Society wishes to opena communication with you atthis time, when corruption has acquired a publicity in the senate, which exacts from the honour the British nation renewed exertions for parliament reform—without prejudging the probable event—(this is a material passage. when you connect it with what is found in other subsequent papers) —“ even of such an application to the legislature, the soeicly is willing to circulate the information, and to co-operate in the measures, that may seem best adapted to further so desirable and so important an end; it is willing to hope the redress of every existing grievance at the hands of a government resulting from an extraordinary convocation in 1688—an extraordinary convention of all, who had at any preceding time been elected representatives of the people, assisted by the hereditary counsellors of the nation, and a peculiar deputation from the metropolis; which - national constituting assembly cashiered for miisconduct a king of the house vf Stuart. — 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 164 The opinions und principles of this society are best explained by an appeal to their literary representative— o James Mackintosh, author of the Vindiclz Gallice, the society affers the tribute of its approbation-and gratitude for the knowledge, the eloquence, and the philosophical spirit, with which he has explained, defended, and commented on the revolution of France; it hesitates to assent to this only of his opinions—that there are but two interests in society, those of the rich and those of the poor—if so, what chance have the latter? Surely the interests of all the industrious, from the richest merchant to the poorest mechanic, are, in every community the same, to lessen the numbers of the unproductive, to whose maintenance they contribute, and to do away such institutions and imas abridge the means of maintenance, y resisting the demand for labour, or by sharing in reward : as the means most conducive to this comprehensive end, the Norwich Revolution Society desires an equitable representation of the people. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 165 “ The Rights of Man by Thomas Paine, and the advice to the privileged orders by Joel Barlow, a book which I shall give in evidence, and therefore shall state some passages from presently, “have also been read with attention and circulated with avidity
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 166 Now, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 167 Barlow’s book you will find is, in the plainest and most unequivocal language, as I understand it, an exhortation to all people to get rid of kingly government, and addressed more Particularly to the two societies I have mentioned, as containing the substance of the buSiness, in which they are interested, as you will see when I come to state the transactions of October 1792. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 168 he Rights of Man by Thomas Paine, and the advice to the privileged orders by Joel Barlow, have also been read with attention and circulated with avidity; they point out with clearness most of the abuses which have accumulated under the British government ; they attack with energy most of the prejudices which have tended to perpetuate them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 169 Now, how any man living could thank these People without informing them that, if they really meant well to their country, they must be ignorant in the extreme, or something worse, if they could reconcile cither the Rights of Man or Joel Barlow’s book on the Privileged Orders with the principles of that convention in 1688, which is the foundation of the liberties of this country, is to me quite inexplicable. But, after stating the constitution of this country, in a letter fabricated with great art, there follow the twelve names of the intended associated members from Norwich; and the description of some of these twelve happens also, from a singular circumstance, to be in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke. Then this society returns thanks to the societies at Sheffield and Norwich for these communications. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 170 The resolutions of the London Corresponding Society, which I told you were sent on the 30th of March, are to this effect : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 171 “ Resolved, That every individual has aright to share in the government of that society of which he is a member, unless incapacitated. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 172 “ Resolved, That nothing but non-age, or privation of reason, or an offence against the general rules of society, can incapacitate him. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 173 “ Resolved, That it is not less the right, than the duty of every citizen, to keep a watchful eye on the government of this country, that the laws, by being multiplied, do not degenerate into oppression, and that those who are intrusted with the government do not substitute private interest for public advantuge. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 174 “ Resolved, That the people of Great Lritain are not properly represented in pariiament, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 175 “ Resolved, That in consequence of a partial, unequal, and inadequate representation, together with the corrupt method in which representatives are elected, oppressive taxes, unjust laws, restrictions of liberty, and wasting of the public money, have ensued. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 176 “ Resolved, That the only remedy to those evils is, a fair and impartial representation of the people in parliament. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 177 “ Resolved, That a fair and impartial representation can never take place until partial privileges are abolished, and the strong temptations held out to electors afford a presumptive proof, that the representatives of this country seldom procure a seat in parliament from the unbought suffrages ofa free people. Resolved, That this society do express their abhorrence of tumult and violence : and that, as they aim at reform not anarchy, reason, firmness, and unanimity be the only arms they employ, or persuade their fellowcitizens to exert against abuse of power. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 178 Gentlemen, in this, which I have now read to you, I am willing, if you please, that you should construe every word of it, though certainly it is pot consistent with the principles of British government, upon this principle, that those, who sent that paper to the Constitutional Society, if it even was sent there at all, really understood it to be consistent with the principles of the British government; and I claim no credit for the veracity with which Lassert, that this conspiracy has existed, unless I show you by subsequent acts of this society, that at this moment they meant what Mr. Paine says, in principle and practice, is the only rational thing—a representative government ; the direct contrary of the government which is established here. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 179 You will find, by what I shall lay before you, that there was a society in Southwark. —To this society the London Corresponding Society, in a letter which I have to read to you presently, stated their adoption of all Mr. Paine’s principles, with a view, as I think, to the practice recommended in his works: this society also received the thanks of the Constitutional Society fora communication which I am about to state to you; and the London Corresponding Society afterwards entered, as it seems to me, into-a combination with them, upon the principles stated in that communication: I say it is impossible, attending toConstitutional Society—“ and with the Socithese facts, for any man who reasons fairly, ety for Constitutional Information in London, to doubt that the principle of the London ! as the best means of cementing the common 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 180 Corresponding Suciety and of the Constitutio-nal Society was, to furm a representatice go- ; vernment, in this country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 181 A declaration from a society in Southwarkwas read: Resolved, that the thanks ofthis society be given to the Southwark societyfor the following communication, and that it be published in the newspapers : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 182 “ April 19, 1792, at the Three Tuns tavern,Southwark — Resolved, That we do now form ourselves into a society for the diffusion ofpolitical knowledge. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 183 “ Resulved, That the society be denomi- nated the Friends of the People. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 184 “ Resolved, That the following be the declaration of this suciety,"—which is the preamble to the constitution in France, in the year 171 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 185 “ Considering that ignorance, forgetfulness, or conten:pt of the rights of men, are the sole causes of public grievances, and the corruption of government, this society, formed for the purpose of investigating and asserting thoserights, and of uniting our efforts with others : of our fellow-citizens for correcting national abuses, and restraining unnecessary and exorbitant taxation, do hereby declare— 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 186 “First, That the great end of civil society is general happiness. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 187 Secondly, fhat no form of government is good, any farther than it secures that object. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 188 “ Thirdly, That all civiland political autho-rity is derived from the pecple—that people, of whom they were afterwards to form a convention. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 189 “ Fourthly, That equal active citizenship is the unalienable right of all men; minors, criminals, and insane persons excepted. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 190 Now will my friend dispute with me what these principles, according to the ideas of those who state them, lead to? “ Fifthly, That the exercise of that right, in appointing an adequate representative government,—that is, the government, which Mr. Paine tells you, rejects every thing that is hereditary—is what; “ the wisest device of human policy—not only that, but it is— “ the only security of national freedom
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 191  Then, is not that a direct assertion, that the British government exists upon principles not reconcilable with the principles of a government that can have any security, or such a security as it ought to have for general treedom? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 192 The Sone for Constitutional Information return their thanks upon that also, and then those persons who write this letter say farther in the same paper— 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 193 “We call upon our fellow-citizens, of all descriptions, to institute societies for the same great purpose—that is the purpose of introducing representative government— and we recommend a general correspondence with each other—but attached and rivetted to the union, and of directing with greater ener, our united efforts to the same common ol jects. ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 194 What were the objects of this society ? You will find that the objects of this society were the objects of the Constitutional Society ; and you will find presently that they were the objects of the Corresponding Society : The Constitutional Society resolved, that every society, desiring an union, or correspondence with this, and which doth not profess any principles destructive to truth or justice —how this gives occasion for the first remark T have to make upon language—“ or subversive to the liberties of our country: but which, on the contrary, secks, as we do, the removal of corruption from the legislature and abuses from the government, ought to be, and we hope will be embraced with the most brotherly affection and patriotic friendship by this society. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 195 1 observe upon this, that all this handsome language is perfectly consistent with this principle, in the minds of those who write it, and they do not venture to explain it, because I think they durst not explain it,—with this idea in their minds, that those principles were destructive of truth aud justice were subversive to the liberties of the country, which were principles in opposition to those of Mr. Paine; and that all practice, that was in opposition to the practice he recommends, was subversive to the liberties of the country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 196 I come now to a circumstance or two, which lead me to state shortly what will be proved to be the original constitution of the London Corresponding Seciety—the plan (the efficacy of which had been tried in France, and which men, who came from that country, were probably well acquainted with)—was, to unite, first small bodies of men—as svon as they came to a greater number, to divide them into smaller parties, and so to spread themselves by degrees (as you will find in the letters, was the purpose of these societies), from town to town, from village to village, from hamlet to hamlet, till, as they explain it, there should not be an unenlightened man in the country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 197 The constitution of the London Corresponding Society was formed upon this principle ; it will appear from the written evidence which will be produced to you, that a gentle. man of the name, I think of Felix Vaughan, was appointed a delegate upon the 30th of April, for No. 63; that Mr. Hardy cousulted him; and, being also appointed to form a constitutional code of Jaws for the Londom Corresponding Society, Mr. Hardy consulted him upon that subject. The preamble te the resolutions which formed their constitution was this: “ Whereas it is notorious that very numerous butthensomeand unnecessary taxes are laid on the persons and families of us and others the industrious inhabitants of Greatfor No. 68; Mr. Richter, a pai 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 198 Britain, an exeeedingly great majority of whom are, notwithstanding, excluded from all representation in parliament; and as apon inquiry into the cause of this grievance, which 13 at once an obstruction to our industry, and a diminution of our property, we find that the constitution of our country, which was purchased for us at the expense of the lives of our ancestors, has by the violence and intrigue of criminal and designing men, been injured aad undermined in its most essential and impettant parts, but particularly in the House of Commons, where the whole of the supposed representation of the people is neither more nor less than an usurped power—I hope, gentlemen, it cannot be required that I should contend against such an assertion in this lace, if a court of law in this country has not ost all the character that belongs to law ; how that usurped power was ever to be employed as an organ in the constitution of that new representative body that this society atmed at, consistent with their own principles, remains to this moment unintelligible to me— ‘arising either from abuses in the mede of election and duration of parliaments, or from a corrupt property in certain decayed corporations, by means of which the liberties of this nation are basely bartered away from the bribed profit of the members of parliament: and as it farther appears to ws, that until this source of corruption shall he cleansed by the determination, perseverance, firmness, and union of the people at large, we are robbed of the inheritance so acquired for us by our forefathers, and that our taxes, instead of being lessened, will go on increasing, as they will furnish more bribes, places, and pensions, to ministers and members of parliament: we therefore, having resolved to unite ourselves into one firm and permanent body, for the purpose of informing ourselves and others of the exact state of the present parliamentary Tepresentation, for obtaining a peaceful but adequate remedy to this intolerable grievance, and for corresponding and co-operating with other societies, united for the same objects, have unanimously adopted the following regulations for the internal order and government of our society. They then state their regulations ; and their constitution having been thus formed, they publish it afterwards in the month of May. What observations they state to the public upon it in the month of May I shall have occasion to represent presently ; you will see the manner of proceeding with respect to the election of their delegates, by the production of a particular paper. On the 13th of April, a person, whom you have heard much of Mr. Margarot, is appointed a delegate; upon the 30th of April, Mr. Vaughan was, as tar as the paPer is evidence of the fact, appointed delegate for Number 65; Mr. Richter, a party named in this indictment, and Mr, a another party, inst whom the grand jury have found abil, but who is not caandiea this indictment, are also appointed delegates. Mr. Hardy is not only secretary, but he is appointed, upon the 13th of April a delegate ; and there is a choice of delegates for the whole of these bodies. You will find they afterwards met from time to time, to pursue the great purposes of their incor, tion, at an alehouse, I think, the Bell in Exeter street, in the Strand, from which place some of the correspondence I am abontto state to you comes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 199 Gentlemen, the Society for Constitutional Information, having afhliated several societies very suddenly with themselves—whether Mr. Paine remained in this country or not I cannot tell—they felt an inclination to affiliate with another society, which is to be, as it appears to me, in justice to them, very strongly distinguished indeed with respect to the principles upon which they acted, I mean the socicty calling itself the Friends of the People, meeting at Free Masons’ Tavern: with what prudence or discretion that society formed itself is a subject which I shall not discuss, but it is a most important fact, that in the first attempt, which the Society for Constitutional Information made (and it ought to be known in justice to the Friends of the People), the first attempt they made to affiliate themselves with the Society of tha Friends of. the People, that society, in correspondence that will be read to you, acts as some individual members of tlie Constitutional Society had done ; they say —“ No, we discover your design from what you are doing; you tell us, from your approbation of resolutions entered into at Manchester, signed by Mr. Walker and Mr. Jackson, that you approve the sort of schemes Mr. Paine has set forth; that you approve projects of giving, im loose and indefinite terms, the full extent a what you a the rights of the ple, to the people: that is Ai see intent ae think,—and, gentiemen, many a man may very honestly thinic it, but he must go about the execution of his thoughts in a leyal way, if he does so think, if he means to reduce his thoughts into praetice—“ we think that parliament is not adequate to all the ends for which it is instituted as a body, through which is to be spoken, as far as the constitution requires, the will of the people; but we do not mean what you mean; we mean to preserve the forms of the constitution, which itis clear you do not; we mean, says lord John Russell, in a letter, which will be read, “ to preserve the forms of the constitution, and therefore must decline all correspondence with you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 200 Gentlemen, it happens—it belongs to secieties of this nature, and I desire to he understood, therefore, in stating it, only es stating a circumstance, which in its nature does belong to those societies, and which will happen—that it was thought necessary, forthe great purpose of doing that which was eventually to be done, that a society, which had rejected co-operation with the Society for Constitutional Information, should still be kept, for the purposes of the Society for Constitutional Information, in fact and effect corresponding and connected with it. Accordingly Pi will find that this Suciety of the Friends of the People, rejecting upon principle the plan which they thought abandoned the forms of the constitution, that this society retained, in its own bosom, according to the account J have of it, many members, who happened to belong to the other society, and the work of both societies went on by the same instruments: they were thus therefore connected in fact, though they did not choose as a body to have one society in connexion with the other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 201 Gentlemen, having stated that, you will allow me now to mention, though it is a little out of date, but it also connects itself with and illustrates the last observations I made, that the society at Sheffield, which had connected itself by affiliation with the Society for Constitutional Information, and you will also find with the London Corresponding Society, had received, about the 24th of May, intelli-ae from the Society of the Friends of the eople, which stated to them very correctly what their objects were, the means by which they meant to accomplish them, and the attention which they meant to pay to the forms of the constitution. Youwill now see what the Society for Constitutional Information understood to be the objects of the Sheffield Society, and what the Sheffield Society understood to be the objects of the Society for Constitutional Information. The Sheffield Society (though I do not know that they kept their word) distinctly disavowed, in a letter of the 26th May, to the ConstitutionalSociety, having any thing more to do with that socleyy called: the Friends of the People —which meant to preserve the forms of the constitution ; represented that they had totally misunderstood them, and would have nothing more to do with them, but to the extent, to which the Society for Constitutional Information permitted. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 202 You will find in a letter from Sheffield, of the 26th of May, and this corrected by Mr. Tooke, that they thank the Constitutional Society for accepting their members. They then state that they had increased to two thousand four hundred
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 203 “ On Saturday last, the 19th instant, we received a packet of iale addresses, resolutions, &c. from the iety (Free Masons’ Tavern), which, on mature consideration, we find ourselves not so well reconciled to the ideas they convey to us as we could wish, if they had appeared in a different point of view; nor do they afford us such a Being pecapect, as we were apprehensive might be expected from an association of so respectable a body, under the high denomination of ‘the Friends of the People. In our opinion, their answer of the 19th instant to your letter of the 27th ultimo is no ways compatible with that appellation ;from the known respectability of many names which appear amongst them, we had entertained great i ot their real use,—mark the words, gentlemen—“ in obtaining a thorough reform—now mind what that reform is—“ in obtaining a thorough reform upon the principles of the rights of man,—that is, a representative government, rejecting the king, and rejecting every other part of the constitution of this country, except so far as it was consistent (indeed it is not consistent with any part of them) with the principles of the rights of man—“ which can never be accomplished until every man enjoys his lawful and just privileges. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 204 “ Previous to the reception of this packet, we did communicate to them by letter the pleasing hopes it reflected on us on looking forward, viewing such respectable characters signalizing themselves in support of the people’s rights, agreeable to the above principe and the denomination by which they ave entitled themselves, &c. In due course they would receive our letter last Thursday seven-night; and in consequence, we apprehend the packet was forwarded to us on the same day, but without any written communication. We shall not attempt any further communication with them, until we are favoured with your sentiments upon the subject, or until matters of doubt which are at present entertained be removed. Then there 1s a note, which shows the necessity of this fostering care of the Constitutional Society: they say— Birmingham in particular claims all the assistance from established societies, which possibly can be administered. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 205 Having written to the Constitutional Society upon the 26th of May, they find it expedient, for the same purpose, to trouble their correspondents of the London Corresponding Society ; “We were favoured with your very affectionate letter of the 7th ultimo, and communication, in due course; and I am directed by this society to inform you, that it is with infinite satisfaction they receive the information, that your firm and laudable endeavours are directed to that effectual and necessary purpose, of opening and enlightening the ublic mind, and disseminating useful knowedge amongst the general mass of the people : by an orderly proceeding in a firm pursuit of truth and equity, there cannot be a doubt but that our joint endeavours will in due time be crowned with success. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 206 “ As brothers and fellow-labourers we congratulate you on the rapid progrees of useful and real knowledge in the various parts of this nation, which sufficiently indicates that the time cannot be far distant when truth will be more predominant, equity more gererally administered, and sound wisdom more universally sought after. When pride, ambition, and ignorance give place to these virtues, when oppression ceases and charity abounds, when men in principle and practice verify the necessity and advantage of doing to others as they wish to be done by; then, and not till Noe can any people or nation be said to be 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 207 We have herewith enclosed our rules, &c. Should have written you much sooner, but on account of a diappointment in the printing of our articles, &c. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 208 “Our numbers continue to increase, both here, and in the adjacent towns and villages ; a general coucurrence prevails, as to the necessity of the business, and the measures adopted by this society for obtaining our object. It will be of great importance to the cause we are engaged in, that a more frequent communication be maintained amongst: all the similar institutions; for which reason we beg the favour of your correspondence at every convenient specrtaplyy which will be highly obliging to this society, who in return pledge themselves to observe the same rule. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 209 Gentlemen, having stated to you now what it was that the Society of the Friends of the People discovered to be the object of the Constitutional Society, and I agreeing with them in thinking their discovery upon that subject was accurate and right, you will find it necessary to go back, and to proceed in the order of time to the 7th of April. Mr. Hardy sent from the London Corresponding Society a copy of their resolutions to the Society for Constitutional Information, which was established at Manchester, and desired also to have correspondence with them, as they were engaged in one common cause; that Manchester Society, you will recollect, which hoped that the other great benefits which Mr. Paine had stated, would be carried into effect. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 210 He says, “ We began this society about ten weeks ago; it is composed chiefly of tradesmen and shopkeepers. The enclosed will inform you of the principles we set out upon. —When we first associated, we flattered ourselves that no other societies in the nation were formed upon the same principles—butin two or three weeks afterwards we were most agreeably informed of our brethrenat Sheffield having taken the lead in so glorious a cause —we immediately wrote to them, and were answered without delay, expressing a wish to unite with us, for promoting the ends we have in view, and we are assured of success, by persevering prudently, and with unanimity. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 211 Upon the 18th of April 1799, in furtherance of this plan, you will find Mr. Hardy writes a letter to the president of the society in the Borough—Now that is the society, the principles of which I have so distinctly stated before, as leading to representative government, as the only security for liberty in the country. —It appears that their declarations had also been sent to the London Corresponding 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 212 Society; and Mr. Hardy, upon the 18th of April 1792, says “ I am ordered by the London Corresponding Society, to send a copy of their resolutions to the society that meets at the Three Tuns tavern, in the Borough, established on purpose for restoring the rights of election, or in other words, to obtain aug equal representation of the people of this nation in parliament. ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 213 Now they had avowed, and avowed in their declaration, that their object of a representation of the people in parliament was precisely that more extended one in its principle, which obtained at the timeof the Commonwealth in England—namely, a representation of the people in parliament, termed a parliament, but without King oF Lords, a representative government—“ We should: be very happy to enter into a correspondence with your society—as we are all engaged in the same grand and important cause, there is an absolute necessity for us to unite together, and communicate with each other, that our sentiments and determinations may centre in one point, viz. to have the rights of man re-established, especially in this nation; but our views of the rights of man are not confined solely to this small island, but are extended to the whole human race— black or white, high or low, rich or poor. I give you the following as my own opinion— perhaps you may think it a singular sentiment—and then an opinion is given, which it is my duty to state, though I do not understand it—“ that the king and the nobles, as much as the peasant and ignoble, are equally deprived of their rights
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 214 Our society meets every Monday night. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 215 Gentlemen, there is an answer to this, from a person of the name, I think, of Favell, who is chairman of the Friends of the People in Southwark: he says—“ I duly received your letter, containing the resolutions of the London Corresponding Society—which I have communicated tu our society in the borough— andI am directed to return them the thanks of that society, and to assure them they shall cordially unite with them, and all similar societies throughout the kingdom, in endeavouring to effect those great objects for which they are associated—namely, to engage the attention of their fellow-citizens to examine the general abuses of government, and to exercise their deliberative wisdom in a calm but intrepid manner in applying those remedies
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 216  This is in April ; and in August they expressly tell you, that there was to be no remedy from parliament—“ in applying those remedies which the country at tage may ultimately require—and they sincerely agree with you in hoping that the long-neglected rights of man will be restored, notonly in this country, but in every part of the globe where man may dwell.—We shall very soon transmit you a copy of our declaration, and hope for your farthur correspondence. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 217 A letter aud resolutions from the Revolution and Constitutional Societies at Norwich, dated 26th of April 1792, were read at themeeting of the society for Constitutional In- : formation, on the 4th of May following: they distinctly state—that Mr. Paine’s books were to be the medium, through which the preju- ; dices that had grown up under the British ernment were to be get rid of, and the ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 218 Constitutional Society return them theirthanksjn these words—“ This society receives the above communication with the most heartfelt satisfaction, and desires earnestly to concur and co-operate with those societies in their 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 219 Jaudable objects ; that the secretary do inform them of the same, and that this society has unanimously elected the twelve members of “the Norwich societies to be associated memders of this society. ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 220 Upon the 11th of May 1792, the Constitutional Society resolved, that there should be a communication from that society with the society of the Friends of the Constitution at Paris, known by the name of Jacobins: they send an address to them, which is in thesewords—“ Brothers and fellow-citizens of the world— 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 221 he cordial and affectionate reception with which you have honoured our worthy countrymen, Mr. Thomas Cooper, and Mr. James Watt, members of the society of Manchester, and united with our society, has been communicated to us by the correspondence of those gentlemen. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 222 ‘In offering you our congratulations on the glorious revolution which your nation has accomplished, we speak a language which only sincerity can dictate. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 223 “ The formality of courts affords no example tous: to do our thoughts justice, we give to the heart the liberty it delights in, and hail you as brothers. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 224 “It is not among the least of the revolutions which time is unfolding to an astonished world, that two nations, nursed by some wretched craft in reciprocal hatred, should so suddenly break their common odious chain, and rush into amity. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 225 “ The principle that can produce such an effect is the offspring of no earthly court; and whilst it exhibits to us the expensive iniquity of former politics, it enables us with bold feli‘eity to say we have done with them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 226 “ In contemplating the political condition of nations, we cannot conceive a more diabolical system of government than that which has been generally practised over the world, to feed the avarice, and gratify the wickedness of ambition ; the fraternity of the human race has been destroyed, as if the several nations of the earth had been created by rival gods— 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 227 “man has not considered man as the work of one creator. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 228  The political institutions, under which he has lived, have been counter to whatever religion he professed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 229 “Instead of that universal benevolence, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 230 -which the morality of every known religion declares, he bas been politically bred to consider his species as his natural enemy, and to describe virtues and vices by a geugraphical chart. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 231 he principles we now declare are not peculiar to the society that addresses you; they are extending themselves with accumulatin force through every part of our country, an derive strength from an union of causes, which no other principles admit. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 232 he religious friend of man, of every denomination, records them as his own ; they animate the lover of rational liberty, and they cherish the heart of the poor, now bending unae a oppression of taxes, by a prospect of relief, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 233 “We have against us only that same enemy, which is the enemy of justice in all countries, a herd of courtiers fattening on the spoil of the public. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 234 It would have given an additional triumph to our congratulations, if the equal rights of man, which are the foundation of your declaration of rights, had been recognised by the governments around you, and tranquillit established in all; but, if despotisms be still reserved to exhibit, by conspiracy and combination, a further example of infamy to future ages, that power that disposes of events, best knows the means of making that example finally beneficial to his creatures. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 235 “ We have beheld your peaceable principles insulted by despotic ignorance ; we have seen the right hand of fellowship, which you hold out to the world, rejected i those who riot on its plunder; we now behold you a nation provoked into defence, and we can see no mode of defence equal to that of establishing the general freedom of Europe. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 236 “ln this best of causes we wish you success; our hearts go with you; andin saying this we believe we utter the voice of millions. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 237 Gentlemen, this address was signed by the chairman of the Constitutional Society, and transmitted to Mr. Watt, at Paris; and, upon the 28th of May 1792, was ordered to be published. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 238 After this, the principles of Mr. Paine, which, you observe, contain the doctrines that TI have been stating to you, were carried farther in a third book (I’ mean in that book called the Address to the Addressers, which I shail also be able to give in evidence to you) : Mr. Paine having there gone the length of asserting the folly, absurdity, and wickedness of the government, under which we live—not only of asserting the incompeteney of government, as it is constituted, to change itself, but having asserted that a conventionary representation of the people, in that sense in which we speak of it, must do this work, he proceeds to the extent of stating the plan and form of an organization of that sort, upon which the convention was to be framed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 239 Gentlemen, it was impossible not toapply to the justice of the law, against the attack made upon our government by the person who went to the extent I am now stating, with the approbation, published over and over again, of these societies, who, in their corporate character, if I may so speak, could not be prosecuted for doing 1t—it became necessary to ask a juty of this country, whether these doctrines were to be tolerated—what is “the consequence of that? [t is, that these societies immediately enter into subscriptions for the support of Mr. Paine, and they consider themselves as engaged in propagating his works in that way, in which no work ever was propagated —to the intent to produce that convention, without which the nation, in no organization of its government, could be said, according to them, to exist in a state of freedom as a nation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 240 Gentlemen, you will not be surprised, if it also appears that, in going on progressively to the execution of the mischief that was intended, they became more mischievous; and you will find members parting from the seciety, expressly telling them, that they meant to destroy the government of the country ; that they cannot, therefore, stay among them ; and to which members, as far as appears from any information that I have had, they did not condescend to explain themselves—to say, No, you have mistaken our object—this is not what we mean; but they leave them unanswered, and go on to execute the purposes they were about. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 241 Having come to those resolutions in order to support Mr. Paine in these prosecutions, they publish the resolutions, they publish the books of Mr..Paine, they publish these resolutions in the various newspapers (the editors of these newspapers insuring, if I may so say, themselves against the hazards of the law, some tor more, some for less, and theyrisk the hazard of 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 242 Propagating the doctrines, provided the consideration paid is ample enough, as a premium for the risk), and then these publications are sent down to the country to various places, in hundreds, and thousands—I am sorry to say, to persons of all professions, to distribute—I am Sorry to say, to some of the most sacred professions, whose numes will appear to you when they come to be read—and this mode of propaaling these doctrines is adapted to the utter mpossibility of detection, and for the very piece of having that effect—to make the aw of the country unequal to the mischief, which it was to meet. Atthis time a proclamation was issued hy the executive government of the country, in order to restrain these publications; and both the societies, you will find, cloaking theimselves under the words “a full and fair representation of the people, which words they have never condescended to explain, which words never do exist in any text of any writing of theirs, as I can find, with the mention ofa king, or other house of legislature : they should spread the effect of the mischief more widely and diffusely than otherwise they could have done. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 243 Upon the 24th of May 1792, there isa letter sent from Mr. Hardy, I believe not in his own hand-writing, but I believe in the handwriting of Mr. Vaughan, whomIbefore named to you, in which he states, that, by the direction of the London Correspunding Society, he had the honour of enclosing to them a copy of their address and regulations, which he requests they will communicate to: the Constitutional Society. The thanks of the society were given to them for this; and that is a publication more guarded than anothet you will find published upon the 6th of Aus gust 1792, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 244 After stating their constitution, which I bes fore mentioned to you, it says— But, as Pros vidence has furnished men in every statioa with faculties necessary fur judging of what concerns themselves, shall we, the multitude, suffer a few, with no better right than ourselves, to usurp the power of governing us without control? Surely not: let us rathef unite in one common cause to cast away our bondage, being assured, that in so doing we are protected by a jury of our countrymen, while we are discharging a duty to ourselves, to our country, and to mankind. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 245 Gentlemen, you will find from a paper of the 6th of August, that that, which they supposed was to meet with protection from a jury of the country, was a ccmbination to re form the government of the country by means—other than application to parliament —which binds together, with the king, as the great political body of the country, the whole system under which we live. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 246 Gentlemen, the London Corresponding Sos ciety, as to the king’s proclamation, followed the example of the Canatitunonal Society, and, on the 3tst of May, 1792, in a paper that will be read to you, they vilify the proclamation ; and this paper having been communicated by the London Corresponding Society to the Constitutional Society — they, aware of the nature of it, order, that that paper should be published in such newspapers as will receive the advertisements of this socicty
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 247  They were pretty well aware that they were of such a nature as made it somewhat hazardous to publish them, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 248 You will find a letter, dated the 14th of June, 1792, trom certain persons styling themselves the Editors of the Patriot (whe they are Iam not able to state to you, but who, for the purposes of these societies, thought it necessary to conceal their names), in which they desire the Corresponding Society to take am opportunity of enlightening the public mind by publications, by advertisements, by circulating those papers in villages to country farmers, desiring, as I 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 249 vilify the proclamation, and they make tiestated, to conceal their name, but requesting very means the executive government took tothat the papers might be sent-to a person, suppress the mischief a mean by which theywhy holds an important situation in a subseent part of this business—a Mr. Gale, a kseller at Sheffield. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 250 Gentlemen, there will be laid before you various parts of the proceedings of the Constitutional Society, which relate to Mr. Paine, which I shall now pass over, except for the purpose of calling your attention to another publication of his upon the sixth of June, 1792, and which was addressed to Mr. Dundas; you will likewise find that that book, which will be given you in evidence, distinctly disavows all hereditary government; all monarchy, under whatever qualifications ; and then, for the purpose of circulating this doctrine, as they had before circulated the doctrines in other works of this gentleman, they order, “ that twelve thousand copies of that letter shall be printed for the society, for the purpose of being transmitted to our correspondents throughout Great Britain, and that a committee be appointed to direct the same. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 251 Gentlemen, I pass on now to the 6th of August, 1792; at which time there appears to me to have been an extremely important transaction in the London Corresponding Society; it is the propagation of an address of that date, which first developes, as it seems to me, though in somewhat of covert language, the determination of these societies to work what they call a reform without any communication whatever with that parliament, which they held to be incompetent to bring about the business. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 252 You will find that, upon the &th of August, Mr. Hardy wrote a letter to Mr. Tooke; that he sent him a proof copy of this address; that he hoped it would merit his attention, and his approbation; that he should be exceedingly happy to be favoured with his opinion of it before it was printed. The address, after stating what they considered as the grievances of the country, states this— Such being the forlorn situation of three fourths of the nation, how are Britons to obtain information and redress? Will the Court, will ministry afford either? Will parliament grant them? Will the nobles or the clergy ease the people’s sufferings? No. Experience tells us, and proclamations confirm it, that the interest and intention of power are combined tu keep the nation in torpid ignorance. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 253 ‘ “It then states the only resource to be in these societies; it then states various detailed reasons, which you will hear, and then proceeds to this effect: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 254 “ Numerous other reforms would undoubtedly take place, even in the first session of parliament so elected, dependant only on their electors the peoples untorn therefore by faction, undivided party, uncorrupted by ministry, and uninfluenced but by the public good. Every transaction would tend to reform, aud a strict economy, its natural consequence, might soon enable us to reduce our taxes ; and by the integrity of parliament, that reduction would light upon such objects as best might relieve the poor; this to the people would prove an advantageous and a novel session, and to an honest parliament not a tiresome one. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 255 “ Therefore, Britons, friends, and fellow. citizens, with hand and heart unite, claim what is your right, persevere and be free, for who shall dare withstand our just demands? Oppression, already trembling at the voice of individuals, will shrink away and di for ever, when the nation united shall assert its privileges and demand their restoration. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 256 Gentlemen, the address you will find was circulated with infinite industry to every correspunding society in the kingdom, conveyed through every possible channel, the doctrine adopted by all the affiliating societies; ard the plan, which they went upon from this 6th of Augus& 1792, appears to have been a plan to redress themselves by their own ower, and by their own strength, and not by application to that parliament, which alone can act in legislation: it seems to me to be impossible that you can mistake what is meant by this paper, if you will give your more particular attention to a paper which was received from a society at Stockport, upon the 27th of November, 1792, and found in the possession of Mr. Hardy: this, aftes adverting to those numerous grievances stated in the address of the 6th of August, 1792, is to this effect: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 257 “ In obedience to the wishes ef the soeiety here, I have the pleasure of acknowledging the honour of your letter, and the packet, which the kindness of our brothers of the London Corresponding Society so opportuncly presented us with. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 258 “It is doubly deserving our thanks, as it shows your kindness, and as it will be useful in the formation of our infant society ; we stand much in need of your experience in thig particular, and we doubt not of your best assistance; we are surrounded by a majority, a formidable one indeed in power, abilities, and numbers, but we are not dismayed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 259 “ We have carefully perused the addresses, and I am to observe upon their contents in general, that the sentiments hardly arise to that height which we expert from men sensible to their full claims to absolute and unconrtrolluble liberty, i. e. unaccountable to any power which they have not immediately constituted and appointed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 260 “ These are our sentiments, whatever may be yours; though, in the present state of political knowledge, it may be prudent not to avow them openly. We desire your sentiments on the means of accomplishing that object, which we presume you have in view in common with us; we think it expedient that we should perfectly understand each other in the beginning, lest the appearance of disunion might furnish matter of triumph to our enemies ; we observe one expression,’—you will take notice that Mr. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 261 Hardy at this time was a member both of the London Corresponding and the Constitutional Societies: —“ we observe one expression, which says, ‘ numerous other reforms would take place,’ &c. &c.; but we ask how is that parliament to be chosen? Can we erfet st from the present order of things? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 262 ould not all the evil be done away at once by the people assembling in convention ? Does it appear probable that the odious laws which we complain of, will be abolished any other way? Can the grievances arising from aristocracy be redressed while the retains its present authority in the legislature ? —whether this blank is to be filled up with crown or the House of Lords is for you to judge—“ retains its present authority in the legislature? Is the universal right of conscience ever to be attained while the maintain their seats onthe “ Your thoughts on these important points -we most earnestly desire may be transmitted to us as soon as possible, not directed as the Jast,—and this you will find often occurs ; letters sent under a feigned direction; “ we fear it will excite suspicion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 263 The Stockport Society say of the address of the 6th of August, 1792, sent tothem, that they think it hardly amounts to sentiments such as theirs, namely, that they must have absolute and uncontrollable liberty, unaccountable to any power which they have not immediately constituted—that could not be the king and parliament of Great Britain— they say, ““ We presume you have the same view in common with us, and we desire to have your sentiments upon the means of accomplishing that object. What object? The object of putting themselves in a situation of being unaccountable to any power, which they themselves had not immediately constituted and appointed—how was that to be done 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 264 was it to be done by parliament? The address of the 6th of August had disavowed that it was to be done by parliament. Is it to be done, while the other parts of the legislature hold their situation in the legislature? We presume you have the same object: tell us what you think upon this oceasion. This was the occasion, upon which the address of the 6th of August ought to have been explained, if they meant to disavow that they had any such object ; but what is the answer ?—The answer in effect is: That full and fair representation of the people that we are aiming at, is that which Is to be the mediate or immediate instrument of removing all the grievances we labour under, though prudence does not permit us to speak all we think upon the subject. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 265 “ With infinite satisfaction the London Corresponding Society’s committee perused your letter; they are happy to learn your steady determination, in spite of all obstacles, to pursue that sole means of political felicity, a perfect representation of the people. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 266 “ Now, what was the sole means of this political felicity—a perfect representation of the people
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 267 It was the formation of a power by the people making themselves unaccountable to any other power, to any power but that which they had immediately themselves constituted, namely, an assembly by a convention of the people. Then, why do not they speak out? They say, “ With regard to our publications, our sentiments are expressed in as strong terms as prudence will permit, yet plain enough to convince the public, that, while we expect. every thing from an honest 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 268 ; and an annual parliament,—a body might exist under the term parliament in a commonwealth, as well as under a king—“ nothing short of such a senate, chosen by the i whole nation, will satisfy us. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 269 “ True generosity, the characteristic of this nation, and of all unperverted men thoughout the globe, calling upon us to countenance at this juncture the arduous struggle of the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 270 French nation against despotism and aristocracy, those foes to the human race, we have 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 271 ‘ resolved upon addressing the French National Convention. You will permit me to observe, this was upon the 11th of October 1792: the king of France was deposed in effect upon the 10th of August 1792. This passage, in the transactions of this society, appears to me te be peculiarly worthy your attention. “ Without entering into the probable effects of such a measure, effects, which your society will notfail to discover, we invite you to join us; and to that end, herewith you have a copy of our intended address; if you approve the idea, and will concur in sending it, be pleased to return us without delay, a copy signed by 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 272 ‘your president: we will then associate yourbody with ours, and with some others, who have already assented to the measure: if, on the contrary, you disapprove that mark of zeal towards the only nation that has hitherto undertaken to restore to mankind its just rights, please to communicate to us your objections. This was upon the 11th of October 1792; upon the 6th of October 1792, Mr. Barlow (whose name occurs before with respect to his publication relative to the privileged orders) writes a letter to the socicty for Constitutional Information, accompanied with a book, called “ Advice to the National Convention of France ; and you will be pleased to observe, that Mr. Barlow, and a Mr. Frost afterwards, in the month of November, were sent with an address from the Constitutional Society to Paris, as their delegates for that purpose, The letter of Mr. Barlow. is in these words: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 273 “ I have lately published a small treatise under the title of ‘A Letter to the Nation “Convention of France, on the Defects of the “Constitution of 1791, and the extent of the “Amendments which ought to be applied :’ although the observations contained in this letter are more particularly applicable to the French nation in the present crisis of its government, yet, as the true principles of society are every where the same, their examination cannot be unseasonable in any nation, or at any time; believing, therefore, that the subject of this treatise will not be thought foreign to the great object of your association, I present a copy of it to you with the same coulidence as I have done to the National Canvention, and to the Constitutional Society at London, a confidence arising trom the full persuasion that the work is founded in truth and reason. I take the liberty at the same time to send you a copy of another publication, intituled ‘ Advice to Privileged Orders.’ The present disposition in Europe towards a geneTal revolution in the principles of government is founded in the current of opinin, too powerful to be resisted, as well as too sacred to be treated. with negicct; and it is the duty of every individual to assist, not only in removing the obstructions that are found in the way of this revolution, but in ascertaining, with as much precisivn as possible, the nature of the object to be aimed at, and the consequence to be expected from the attainment: it is above all things to be desired, that the convictions to be acquired from national discussion should precede and preclude those which must result from physical exertion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 274 Now, you will give me leave to state to you what the doctrine is in this book, for which the Society for Constitutional Information, Mr. Hardy then a member of it, thank Mr. Barlow, make him an honorary member, and afterwards depute him to the National Convention of France1. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 275 Gentlemen, the doctrine, I can explain it to you generally, without troubling you by readAng particular passages, amounts to this: Mr. Barlow, after stating the principles of equal active citizenship, which found their way into the constitution of France in 1791, and which constitution had made the king a part of the system of that government, informs them of the glorious victory of the 10th of August, as the papers, which I have to adduce presently, represent it; that it had accomplished finally the effect of those principles, which he understands to be the principles of those to whom he was writing; that it is impossible they should consist with this sentiment, (hat a king could be retained in a government; that the constitution was at variance with itself; that those who made it had not discovered that, or, having discovered it, they thought the time was not yet come, when they could reduce the constitution to that pure government which was the objectof these societies; hethen tells you, that in government the maxim being that a king can do no wrong, the maxim onght to be, that he can du no good. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 276 This gentleman, so stating his doctrine as an explanation of the principles upon which they are acting, is voted by them an honorary member, and afterwards sent to Paris with the papers, which I am about to read to yon: 4 great deal of evidence will be laid before you, to prove that they had beat up all the country for letters and addresses to express the same principles to France, uot on account of the cause of France, but of the cause of England, and with a view to introduce the same effects into England. I shall state but two of these addresses, because they seem to cuntain the effect of all the rest that were actue ally sent. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 277 The London Corresponding Society first of all communicated to the Constitutional Society, in the month of October 1792, their intention of sending an address to France: the Constitutional Society fully approve the puts pose; they see the end that it aims at, and they determine not to concur in the same address, but to send a separate address; and in their paper you may see the principles of both to be principles, which were expressed for the very purpose of aiding the co-operation of the societies in excluding the king trom the government of the country, and of raising arepublic. This is the letter: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 278 “ Frenchmen, while foreign robbers are ravaging your territories under the specious pretext of justice, cruelty and desolation leadingin their van, perfidy and treachery bringing up the rear, yet mercy and friendship impudently held forth to the world as the sole motives of their incursions; the oppressed part of mankind—that is, Great Lritain—“ forgetting for a while their own sufferings, feel only for yours,’ and with an anaious eye watch the event, fervently supplicating the Almighty Ruler of the universe to be favourable to your cause, so intimately blended with their own, that cause which upon the 10th of August had excluded the king from the government of the country—“ frowned upon by an oppressive system of control, whose gradual but continued encroachments have deprived this nation of nearly all its boasted liberty, and brought us almust to that abject state of slavery, from which you have so emerged ; five thousand British citizens indignant manfully step forth to rescue their country trom the opprobrium brought upon it by the supine conduct of those in power; they conceive it to be the duty of Britons to countenance and assist, to the utmost of their power, the champions of human happiness, and to swear to a nation, proceeding on the plan you have adopted, an inviolable friendship. Sacred from this day be that friendship between us, and may vengeance, to the uttermost, over: take the man who hereafter shall attempt to cause a rupture. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 279 “ Though we appear so few at present, be assured, Frenchmen, that our number increases daily: it is true, that the stern uplifted arm of authority at present keeps back the timid; that busily circulated impostures hourly mislead the credulous ; and that court intimacy with avowed French traitors has sume ellect on the unwary and on the ambitious; but with certainty we can inform you, friends and freemen, that information makes a rapid progress among us; curiosity has taken possession of the public mind; the conjoint reign of ignorance and despotism passes away; men now ask each other, What is freedom? what are our rights? Frenchmen, you are already free, and Britons are preparing to become so; casting far from us the criminal prejudices arttully inculcated by evil-minded men and wily courtiers, we, instead of natural enemies, at length discover in Frenchmen our fellow-citizens of the world, and our brethren by the samc heavenly Father, who created us for the purpose of loving and mutually assisting each other, but not to hate, and to be ever realy to cuteach other’s throats at the command of weak and ambitious kings, and corrupt ministers; seeking our real encmies, we find them in our bosoms, we feel ourselves inwardly torn by and ever the victim of a restless and all-consuming aristocracy, hitherto the bane of every nation under the sun; wisely have you acted in expelling it from France. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 280 “ Warm as our wishes are for your success, eager as we are to behold freedom triumphant, and man every where restored to the enjoyment of lis just rights, a sense of our duty, as orderly citizens, forbids our flying in arms to your assistance ; our government has pledged the national faith to remain neutral in a struggle of liberty against despotism. Britons remain neutral !—O shame! but we have trusted our king with discretionary powers; we therefore must obey: our hands are bound, but our hearts are free, and they are with you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 281 “ Let German depots act as they please, we shall rejuice at their fall; compassionating however their enslaved subjects, we hope this tyranny of their masters will prove the means of reinstating in the full enjoyment of their rights and liberties millions of our fellowcreatures. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 282 “ With unconcern therefore we view the elector of Hanover,—that is, the king of 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 283 Great Britain—join his troops to traitors and robbers ; but the king of Great Britain will do well to remember, that this country is not Hanover. Should he forget this distinction, we will not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 284 “ While you enjoy the envied glory of being the unaided defenders of freedom, we fondly anticipate in idea the numerous blessings mankind will enjoy; if you succeed, as we ardently wish, the triple alliance (not of crowns, but) of the people of America France, and Britain, will give freedom to Europe, and peace to the whole world. Dear friends you combat for the advantage of the human race; how well purchased will be, though at the expense of much blood, the glorious unprecedented privilege of saying,— Mankind is free: tyrants aud tyranny are no more : , and this is e reigns on the the wesk of Frenchmen. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 285 Gentlemen, this address, which was sent by that society, was followed by another from the Society for Constitutional Information, upon the 9th of November 1792, which seems likewise to state their principles. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 286 “ Servants of a sovereign people, and benefactors of mankind : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 287 “ We rejoice that your revolution has arrived at that point of perfection which will permit us to address you by this title,’—Servants of a sovereign people. That is not the character of a British government; this is the principle of the Southwark resolutions—“ it is the only one which can accord with the character of true legislators. Every successive epoch in your affairs has added something to the triumphs of liberty and the glorious victory of the 10th of August has finally prepared the way for a constitution, which we trust you will establish on the basis of reason and nature. Mr. Barlow had in effect said and they had made him an honorary member, and had transmitted their address by his hands), that no constitution could reform upon the basis of reason and nature, that left aking in the government, however the gor vernment was modified. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 288 They proceed thus in their address— “ Considering the mass of delusion, accumuJated on mankind to obscure their understandy ings, you cannot be astonished at the opposition, that you have met buth from tyrants and from slaves ; the instrument used against you by each of these classes is the same, tor, in the genealogy of human miseries, ignorance is at once the parent of oppression and the child of submission. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 289 “ The events of oer day are proving, that your cause is cherished by the people in all your continental vicinity: that a majority of each of those nations are your real friends, whose governments have tutored them into apparent foes; and that they only wait to be delivered by your arms from the dreadful necessity of fighting against them, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 290 “ The condition of Englishmen is less to be deplored ; here the hand of oppression has not yet ventured completely to ravish the pen from us, nor openly to point the sword at you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 291 ? They then go on to say : “ From bosoms burning with ardour in your cause, we tender you our warmest wishes for the full extent of ts progress and success; it is indeed a sacred cause; we cherish it as the pledge of your happiness, our natural and nearest friends, and we rely upon it as the bond of fraternal union to the human race, in which union our own nation will surely be one of the first to concur. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 292 “ Qur government has still the power and perhaps the inclination to employ hirelings to contradict us; but it is our real opinion, that we now speak the sentiments of a great majority of the English nation. The people here are wearied with imposture, and worn out with war, they heve learned to reflect that beth the age and the other are the offspring of unnatural combinations if society, as relative to systems of government, not the result of the natural temper of nations as relative to each others happiness. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 293 “ Go on, legislators, in the work of human happiness; the benefit will in part be ours, but the glory shall be all your own; it Is the reward of your perseverance, it is the prize of virtue, the sparks of liberty preserved in EngJand for ages, like the coruscations of the Northern Aurora, serving but to show the darkness visible in the rest of Europe. The lustre of the American republic, like an effulgent morning, arose with increasing vigour, but still too distant to enlighten our hemisphere, till the splendour of the French revolution burst forth upon the nations in the full fervour of a meridian sun, and displayed,—attend to the words—“in the midst of the European world the practical result of principle which hilosophy had sought in the shade of speculation, and which experience must every where confirm,—the principles of Mr. Paine, who went over to form one in that convention, the existence of which shows the practical result of those principles, which philosophy had sought, and which experience was to confirm —it dispels the clouds of prejudice from all people, reveals the secrets of all despotism, and creates a new character in man. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 294 “ In this career of improvement, your example will be soon followed; for nations, rising from their lethargy, will reclaim the rights of man with a voice which man cannot resist. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 295 Gentlemen, it will not be matter of surprise to you, that letters, such as these to the National Convention in France, should have produced opinions in that country respecting the attachment of individuals in this to their government. It is not therefore very extraordinary, that, upon the 19th of November 1792, that famous decree passed of fraternization with all subjects in all countries, who chose to resist the governments under which they live; but I think you will be surprised that any men could receive in this country, and read with approbation, and enter upon their proceedings, the answers which these addresses brought from France, and which were read in the presence of the prisoner at the bar, without being astonished that they did not at least take some means to reject from them the imputation that they meant in their own country, all that these answers suppose they mean, and all that these answers promise to assist them in accomplishing. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 296 You will find, upon the 14th of December 1792, that a letter from the Society of the Friends of Liberty and Equality, sitting’ at Laon, the head of the department of the Aisne, to the Patriotic Society of London, called the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 297 “Society for Constitutional Information, is read, and referred to their Committee of Correspondence: it isin these words : The Society of the Friends of Liberty and Equality sitting at Laon, the head of the department of the Aisne, to the Patriotic Society of London, called the Society for Constitutional Information
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 298 Generous republicans, the philanthropic gift that you have presented to the wartiors of France—they had sent some shoes, and were at that time thinking of giving them some arms—“ announces with energy the great interest that you take in the sacred cause which they are defending. Accept the thanks of a society that does honour to itself in esteeming you. The time perhaps is not far distant, when the soldiers of our liberty shall be able to testify their gratitude to you: then their arms, their blood itself, shall be at the service of all your fellow-citizens, who, like you, acknowledge no rights but the rights ofman; then France and England shall form together a treaty of union as lasting as the course of the Seine and the Thames; then there, as here, there shall exist no other reign but that of liberty, equality, and friendship. May this day of felicity and glory soon shine upon the horizon of two nations formed to admire each other ! 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 299 Gentlemen, they then enter upon the minutes of the society another letter, from another fraternizing society,—whether one of those societies which they speak of in the beinning of 1792, as aftiliating societies in rance, or not, I do not know; whether they had been assisting to reduce their principles into practicedo not know; but it is clear, that the affiliating society in France offered them their assistance for that purpose. Accordingly, you will find that the Society of the Tats of Liberty and Equality, established at Macon, write to the Constitutional Society at London, adverting to what they had said in their address to the nation about the glorious victory of the 10th August 1792, the circumstances of which shall be described to you in evidence, because you will find that some of the persons who are charged in this indictment (and whose conduct in this conspiracy, will, upon the clearest principles of law, affect all of them) were then present in Paris. They write thus—“ Yes, citizens, our brethren and friends, the 10th of August 1792 shall be distinguisled—what, in the annals of France
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 300 “ distinguished in the annals of the world, as the day of the triumph of liberty, our first revolution—(Mr. Joel Barlow or Mr. Paine, one should have thought, had wrote it)—“ our first revolution did but show to us the salutary principles of the imprescriptible rights of man: all, except the faithless and the enemies of humanity, adopted them with enthusiasm. It was then that we formed ourselves into a society,. in order the better to impress them upon ourselves, and afterwards to teach them to our fellow-citizens. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 301 “ Our first constitution had consecrated them, but had not always taken them for its base : the dominion of the passions, the force of habit, the impression of prejudices, and the power of the intrigues empiged in our Constituent Assembly, found the secret to preserve sufficient authority to our tyrants, to extinguish at some time the sacred rights of nature, and to re-establish despotism on its throne of iron. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 302 ‘ But royalty, thus preserved, was not content with the victory secured to it by a set of men, the greatest part of whom it had corrupted. It was impatient to reap the fruits that it appeared to promise itself; but its too great eagerness has hastened its ruin, and secured the triumph of reason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 303 «¢ The French, proud of their own existence, soon perceived the fruit of their first legislature ; became sensible of the imperfections of their first laws, saw that they made a surrender of the rights of liberty and equality, which they had embraced ;. they roused themselves anew to demand at length laws impartial and humane. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 304 “ From thence the necessary day of the 10th of August 1792, from thence a second revolution, but a revolution, which is only the completion of the first, which has received our vows and our oaths, and which we will bless for ever, if it leads us, as we hope it will, to the happiness of the nation, to the constant maintenance of liberty and equality. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 305 Let intriguers, fools, and tyrants, calumniate us; we despise them too much to condescend to answer them, and seek for their esteem. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 306 “ That which flatters us is the interest that you take in our labours: your attention has contributed to the success of our arms. We desire your esteem, we are proud of your approbation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 307 “ We smile at the expression of the sentiments that you manifested to our representatives. We behold a nation of brethren rouse itself to support the cause of humanity; we behold the brave English adopt our principles, become our friends: we say to each other with pleasure, soon will they become our allies; and uniting our efforts, we shall go on to deliver the universe from the yoke of tyrants, to restore the nations to reason and nature. That day is not far distant, if we may rely on our own courage, and the hope of youralliance. In the mean time, receive our thanks, and corTespond with brethren who set a high value upon your esteem. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 308 Gentlemen, on the 17th of December 1792, the Popular and Republican Society of another department at the mouth of the Rhone, wrote them this letter: he Popular and Republican Society of Apt, department of the Mouths of the Rhone to the Popular Society sitting ut London. Live free or die. Citizens, brethren, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 309 ’ and friends, when two great nations, acquainted with their rights, approximated by their commercial connexions and their national situation, formed to live and to act in concert with each other, begin to form the glorious project of uniting themselves for the regeneration of the human race, one may then say with reason that kings are ripe and ready to fall. How glorious it will be for France and England to have furmed alone a confederacy destructive of tyrants, and to have purchased at the price of their blood the liberty of Europe; we may say more, of the whole universe! Courage, brethren and friends! I¢ is for you to follow in the glorious and hazardous career of the revolution of the world; can you any longer groan under the yoke of a overnment that has nuthing of liberty but the name? for, althuugh your land was inhabited before ours by freemen, can you, with. out delusion, consider your government as such? Will you content yourselves with a partial frecdom? Will the English be satisfied with principles? Will that bold nation, that has produced philosophers the most profound, and that first of all perceived the sparkling rays of freedom, remain a spectatrix in so noble a cause? No, brethren and friends, no? you will soon lift yourselves up against that perfidious court of St. James's, whose infernal policy, like that which found its doom in the Thuilleries, has made so many victims in our two nations, and does disunite them peretually to rule over them. Your love for iberty has fixed your attention upon the wants of our defenders: your generosity towards them has a title to the a kaow ele ment of the republic; we are impatient to furnish you the same advantages: the Popular Societies of France desire ardently the epoch that shall permit them to address their voice to the National Assembly of Great Britain, and to offer to the soldiers of liberty of your nation, arms, bayonets, and pikes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 310 This is the private correspondence between the socictics and the Society for Constitutional Information; but some of the persons named in this Indictment were present at the scenes I am now going to state at the bar of the National Convention in France; others of them delivering these sentiments by their ambassador Mr. Barlow whose principles you have seen, and Mr. Frost, of whom I must state it, because I shall prove it, that he has been convicted in this country of coming from that country with the doctrine of No King; they offer these addresses to the -National Convention of France in terms, the substance of which I will state to you as far as I understand it, to be, and I believe it is an accurate translation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 311 “ Mr. Barlow and Mr. Frost, English citizens, being admitted to the bar, one of them pronounced the following address
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 312 Gentlemen, the actual fact of his pronouncing it will be given in evidence: the date is the 28th of November 1792, nine days after the decree of the National Convention, which had promised fraternal assistance to the subjects of any country that found themselves oppressed by any of their casts and privileged orders, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 313 “ Citizens of France, we are deputed from the Society for Constitutional Information in London, to present to you their congratulations on the triumphs of liberty. This Society had laboured long in the cause with little prospect of success previous to the commencement of your revolution; conceive then their exultations and gratitude when, by the astonishing efforts of your nation, they beheld the reign of reason acquiring an extension and solidity which promised to reward the labour of all good men, by securing the happiness of their fellow-creatures. nf mrenitas societies of a similar nature are now forming in every part of England, Scotland and Ireland; they excite a spirit of universal inquiry into the complicated abuses of government, and the simple means of areform. Afterthe example which France has given, the science of revolutions will be rendered easy, and the progress of reason will be rapid. It would not be strange if, in a period tar short of what we should venture to predict, addresses of felicitation should cross the seas to a National Convention in England. We are also commissioned to inform the Convention, that the society which we represent has sent to the soldiers of liberty & patriotic donation of a thousand pair of shoes, which are by this time arrived at Calais; and the society will continue sending a thousand pair a week for at least six weeks to come; we only wish to know to whose care they ought to be addressed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 314 Why, gentlemen, am I to be told then, that, in the month of November 1792, those who, in August 1792 had said they could ap
ATTORNEYGENERAL 315 Ply with no effect to parliament, had no idea ! of si uch a National Convention in England as that National Convention in France which they were addressing, and from which they were expecting to receive addresses? Am I to be told that they had no idea of such & convention, as should overturn the constitution of this country? It is impossible to put sucha construction uponsuch proceedings. Gentlemen, you will likewise nd that the president of the Convention thought it necessary to give an answer to this address. I will state the substance of it: it will be read in evidence: therefore I shall not take up time in looking for it. The president considering them as generous republicans (and well he might after what had passed), makes an address to them, expressing much the same sentiments as those 1n which they had addressed him, and then he concludes by saying— “Without doubt the time approaches when we shall soon send congratulations to the National Convention of England. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 316 Gentlemen, you will likewise find that the London Corresponding Society, and the Constitutional Society, endeavoured to excite persons in all parts of this kingdom to send these addresses ; that in point of fact, there are various other addresses sent, of similar import, at the instigation of these societies, and the intent of them, I think, cannot possibly be-misunderstood: but take the intent of them to be what you will, let my learned friend tell you, as he will, that there as yet was no war between Great Britain and France you will allow me to say that there is evidence ofa distinct intent that there should be a National Convention in England, and thet the French soldiers of liberty should assist what they would call the soldiers of our liberty, whether there should be a war between Great Britain and France, or not: and vou will allow me to say, that in that very month of November 1792, a passage occurs, in which France does in effect declare war against ail nations that did not adopt her principles, and allow the people to put them into execution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 317 In a conspiracy, as widely extended as this is, I shall undoubtedly insist, before you and the Court, that the acts of individuals, and particularly the acts of persons sent to present addresses to a foreign country, that what they doin reference to these acts is evidence against all ofthem; and likewise that letters which the persons write relative to the same addresses, are evidence against each of them whether written by the particular individual or no, as being in the prosecution of the same purpose. Upon the 20th of September 1792, Mr. Frost, who was then at Paris, states his Notions in a letter to Mr. Tooke, of the rca! effect of this transaction of the 1uth of August 1792, about which time Mr. Paine made his first appearance in the National Convention —“ Without the affuir of the 10th of August liberty was over—We dine to-day with Petion —Paine has entered his name on the roll of parliament, and went through the forms of office with a great deal of nonchalance—We are well ludged, and beside our bed-rooms, have an entertaining room for members to be shown into, and several have called upon us this morning. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 318 Then you will find, that there being a project to send shoes to the soldiers of France, and arms and muskets, with respect to which project the prisoner was a contributor —for the purpose of having this present trom England to France properly distributed in France, the fullowing letter is written to the mayor of Paris: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 319 “ Sir, You are in no want of friends in England, who ardently wish to be useful tu French liberty; but we wish to know some one of your friends who resides in London, in whow you have af entire confidence, and to whom we may give Our money, in the assurance that it will be remitted to you withont delay, and without fraud. Mr. Frost to whom T entrust this letter, 18 going to set out imme diately with Mr. Paine for Paris, and aliows me ne time for ceremony, if it were necessary. I request you to scnd me the name of some Frenchman in London, merchant, or other, for the purpose above mentioned. We can now begin the public contribution towards our patriotic gift with a -thousard pounds sterling, and I have no doubt’ but it will amount in time to several thousands; if you consider this step in the same point of view that we do, you. will see in it much tuse to the common cause in England and ! by no means such as were cakulated in any 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 320 France. 1 entreat you to give me your sentifrents upon the subject, and to point out to me the means by which I may be useful to This is answered, upon the 1st of October, by Petion,; thus—“ You cannot, sir, doubt of my eagerness to second views so useful, which will for evec merit our gratitude, will zivet the links of fraternity between us, and must duce the greatest advantages to England and France. sending you without delay, the name of the person in whose hands you may place the funds whieh you destine to the support of a cause which, in truth, is that of all people who cherish liberty. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 321 Gentlemen, it may be iti the recollection of perhaps most who now hear me, that circumstances of this sort, which were supposed to be in existence, but, which, in fact, were not capable of being proved to be in existence, had excited in this country considerable alarm in the minds of many persons who live in it. This alarm, it seems to have been thought necessary, both in the Constitutional Society, and-also in the London Corresponding Society, in some degree to lay asleep, as far as it affected them; they thought it necessary, therefore, to give some declaration, as they call it, of their principles, and I will state to you shortly what that was—but the explanation, which the London Corresponding Society gave, was thought so little safe, though it was given for the purpose of laying asleep alarms, that it will be distinctly proved to you—that being written as I am instructed to state to you (and I do it because I am instructed, and it is my duty), ps Rec by Mr. Vaughan, it was agreed to be stuck up round the town at midnight—that aceordingly a person of the name of Carter, a billsticker, was employed for that purpose ; — that sonte tnistake happened betweerhim and his employers; that having made that mistake, he was not thought a proper person to be employed in considerable business in the society afterwards: this mn was taken up in the act of sticking the bills round this town, whieh contains this address—he was prosecuted—he was convicted—and lay six montha in a gaol in consequence of that conviction ; and this was the fate that attended the issuing into the world an address, which was to appear not originally by daylight, but by midnight. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 322 With respect to the address of the Constitutional Society, I think I shall not be thought to make an unfair observation upon it when I say this—that if I had not read to you what I have already read, you would have found it impossible to say what it was, upon reading that paper that they meant to say, who published it; but after what I have read to you T think you can have no difficulty to determine that the paper they published, and the paper of the Corresponding Society, were 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 323 I shall have the honour, sir, of manner to disavow those principles, which I think I have shown you satisfactorily, from March 1792, were the principles they acted upon and adopted. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 324 Gentlemen, the address of the London Corresponding Society is in these words — “ Friends and fellow-countrymen, unless we: are greatly deceived, the time is approaching when the object for which we struggle is likely to come within our reach, That a nation, like Britons, should be free, it is requix site only that Britons should will it, to become so’—that is a passage borrowed trom Mf. Paine—“ that such should be their will—the abuses of our original constitution, and the alarms of our aristocratic enemies, sufficiently witness: confident in the pony of our motives, and in the jastice of our cause, let us meet falsehood with proofs, and hypocrisy with plainness ; let us persevere in declaring our principles, and misrepresentation will nicet its due reward—contempt. In this view the artifices Of a late aristocratic association, formed on the 20th instant call for a few remarks on account of the declarations they have published, relative to other clubs and societies formed in this nation. It is true that this meeting of gentlemen (for so they style themselves) have mentioned no names, instanced no facts, quoted no authoritiesit was a little difficult to do it, unless 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 325 ‘they had the means of seeing all the correspondences at home and abroad but they take upon themselves to assert that bodies of their countrymen have been associated, professing opinions favourable to the rights of man, to liberty and equality’—mark these expressions—“ and moreover that these opinions are conveyed in the terms, no king, no parliament. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 326 Gentlemen, what I have been endeavouring to state to you is this, that it is necessarily to be inferred from their principles that they did mean to assert, when they were ripe for it, no king, no parliament: it is pot my imputation—I do not know whose it was, to which this alludes, that they did express their opinion in the language, no king, no parliament 5 but I say that they expressed their opinions in lan e, whieh, when accutately looked af, as forcibly import the ideas, as if they had used the wine no king, no parliament—“ if this be intended to include the societies to which we respectively belong, we here, in the most solemn manner, deny the latter of the charge
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 327 What is the latter part of the charge? that they do not mean to have a king or parliament? No—but that the opinions are conveyed in the terms, no king, no parliament.—Whoever shall attribute to us the expenne of no king, no parliament, or any lesign of invading the property of other meng is guilty of a wilful, an ayeuilenk, and a malicious falsehood—and then this paper, stating a great deal- more, which, in justice to the paper itself, shall be read ta you, concludes 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 328 -thus—“ Let us wait and watch the ensuing session of parliament, from whom we have much to hope and little to fear. The House of Commons may have been the source of our calamity, it may prove that of our deliverance; should it not, we trust we shall not prove unworthy of our forefathers, whose exertions in the cause of mankind so well deserve our imitation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 329 Now, gentlemen, I ask, after concluding this letter, what this means—“ if parliament should not do it.If we are ready to admit that parliament is formed upon principles that make it competent to do the thing, if it please to do it, it is all well; but if it will not, then we will not prove unworthy of our forefathers, whose exertions in the cause of mankind so well deserve our imitation—and referring you back te the coeeeapemdts between the Norwich and the London Corresponding Society, to the declaration of the 6th of August 1792, which said they had nothing to look for from parliament—to the correspondence with the National Convention of France—to the conduct, which in the presence of their delegates, was permitted—and never repudiated by any act-of the London Corresponding Society; and referring you, moreover, to the subsequent evidence, which I have to offer to you; I think you will find that the sentiment which is expressed by the author of this paper, upon the 19th of November 1792, was a sentiment which, if followed up by those who continue to hold it, meant that, if parliament did not 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 330 “give them redress, they would have it by their own force. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 331 With respect to the Constitutional Society, all it thinks proper to say upon the subject is this : “ that the object of this society, from its first institution to the present moment of alarm, has uniformly been, to promote the welfare of the people—Ibeg your attention to these words—“ has uniformly been to promote the welfare of the people by all constitutional means.—Now if I were to stop here, with a view to show yeu what you are to understand by the words,—“ all constitutional means—are the means I have been stating unstitutional means? Will it make the means more constitutional than they really are, because thpy choose to call them so
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 332  “ and to expose in their true light the abuses which have imperceptibly crept in, and at last grown to such a height, as to raise the most serious apprehensions in every true friend of the constitution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 333 “Resolved, ¢dly—That this society disclaims the idea of wishing toeffecta change in the pe sent system of things by violence and public commotion, but that it trusts to the good sense of the people—You will find, before I have done, that, in April 1793, it could not trust to the sense of the people— when they ehall be fully enlightened on the subject to wre, without disturbing the public tranquillity, an effectual and permanent reform. Resolved, Sdly—That the intentions of this and similar societies have of late been grossly calumniated by those who are interested to perpetuate abuses, and their agents, who have been industrious to represent the members of such societies, as men of dangers ous principles, wishing to destroy all social order, disturb the state of property, and introduce anarchy and confusion instead of regular government. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 334 “ Resolved, 4thly—That, in order to-counteract the operation of such gross aspersions, and to prevent them from checking the proere of liberal inquiry, it is at this time pecoiarly expedient that this and similar societies should publicly assert the rectitude of their prineiples, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 335 “ Resolved—That the said resolutions be adopted, in order for printing in the news rs. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 336 ow I desire any person to read that paper through again, a hen, gentlemen of the jury, if it is relied upon, be 30 good as to ask yourselves what is the definite meaning in any one passage in it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 337 About the same time there is an address from the Manchester Socicty, dated the 14th of Decemher 1792, which appears to have been read in the Constitutional Society, in the presence of the prisoner, and which address some very particular circumstances about it, for you will find that there was a resohution upon the 14th of December 1792, in these words—“ Read a printed address from Manchester—Resolved, that the said address be approved for publishing in the Hemapapers 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 338 It appears by a paper, which I shall produce to you, that the words Read a printed address from Manchester, are in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke; that the address itself is in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke; whether it was a copy of any address at Manchester or not, I do not know : this address appears a! to be in print; it is seut for publication; and with a view to show to the public what extent the Sstniba on of here has arisen to Aan the progress of a treasonable purpose this address was ordered ta be printed, and that a hundred thousand copies of it should be distributed to their correspondents in Great Britain and Ireland
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 339 The report that was made upon it was, that it had been offered to the Morning Chronicle the Morning Post, and that the paper itself, though drawn by a masterly hand, was such, that they durst not venture to print it—TI believe it was however printed in London. Yourwill occasionally see 5 pa printed in the country, at Manchester, if London will not do it; or if the law of England has reached as far as this side of the Tweed, so as to check the publication of o libel, then it is carried over the Tweed, in order to be published in Scotland, where. it might be more safely done. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 340 Now, in this paper, which bears date wpon the 14th of December 1792, and recollecting, as I hope you will do, what I have ly stated to you of the principles of those who were concerned in this transaction, as these principles had been manifested in all the other transactions, I have stated to you, you will find there is this passage: he says— To gull the poor witb the insolent falsehood, that the laws are the same for the poor as the rich, or with idle panegyrics on a rotten constitution, which you have not examined, and of whicb you feel not the benefit—The real friends of the people hear with pity and bear with patience the hourly calumnies to which they are exposed ; they entertain, however, no personal enmities, no aversion, but to the enemies of the people, and no disrespect to the constitution, but where it is hostile to the rights of the people. Now, why it is said to be hostile to the tights of the people, I think, can be pretty well understood, after what I have stated to ou about these communications with France, t it need not be left there, for you will find that this is more distinctly stated in the draught of an answer toa letter, which was likewise read and entered among the minutes of this society upon the 6th of October 1792: the draught of the answer scems to have been prepared on the 2nd November 1792 ; it was to be sent to the editors of the Patriot. The editors of the Patriot were persons who were living at Sheffield; and it will appear by the rs, the substance of which I have not really ily strength enough to state to you, were affiliated at the same time with the London Corresponding Society, aud also with the Constitutional Socicty, in the propagation of their paces and this in an extent, which no j|anguage can do justice to, which it is imposable to describe to you without reading a particular letter, in which they themselves state their mode of procceding, and which, for the purpose of informing you in this respect, shall be presently read to you: to one-of them the following is an answer, and I beg your attention to it, of the 2nd of Nov. 1792. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 341 “ We rejoice with you in the increase of the members of the societies of freedom ; our bosoms glow with the sentiments—we are brothers in affection with you, and with the freemen of Stockport’—(who wrate that letter which I before observed upon, which states that nothing can do but a convention, and that their object is a government immediately constituted by the people: that that cannot be while the Crown or the Lords, as you choose to cunstrue the letter, retain their authority)—They add—““ Freedom, though an infant, makes “ Herculean efforts—Now they Meant nothing in the world to the prejudice of the monarchy, they meant nothing in the world but a full representation of the ree inaparliament co-existing with king and lords. They add —“ The vipers, aristocracy, that is, persons who have got coats upon their backs—“ and Monarchy—we have it yet in England, gentlemen—“ are panting and writhin Wnder its grasp: may success, peace, ani happiness attend those efforts! — That letter, so prepared, will be produced to you, with the corrections of Mr. Horne Tooke, in his own hand. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 342 Gentlemen, I have now gone through, as well as I am able,—and I hope you will keep in view the case I have stated,—the principles and practices of these societies, with all their affiliations. I ought to mention to you, that you will find ia the evidence, as itis laid efore you, most uncommon industry in picking up fresh connexions. If a paper appeared in the country, stating that a socicty of any sort was formed, you will find immediate industry to connect them, and affiliate them with the London Corresponding and Constitutional Societies. If these societies professed —as, for instance, the Stockport Society professed—that they would have nothing but a government constituted immediately by themselves, they contrive to give an answer satisfactory to them. If the societies professed attachment to the monarchy, and desired explanation whether they meant Mr. Pitt's plan, which Mr. Paine laughs at, or whether they meant the duke of Richmond’s plan—or whether they meant, as a letter, you will hear by and by, says, to rip up monarchy by the roots, you will find they satisfied them all sufficiently to enlist them all for that purpose, which from their own transactions, I state to be neither more nor less, than to do what Mr. Paine did in his book, to combine the principles, which they stated, when the times were ripe for it, with the practices which were correspondent with those principles; to apply those principles, which were alike the principles of these societies and of the French constitution of 1791, and which Mr. Paine, Mr. Barlow, and those addressers to the convenion, receiving such answers from the convention in 1792, declared bad produced a constitution in France upon the 10th of August 1792, to apply them not to form that, which in its nature is an absurdity, a royal democracy, but that which upon principle is consistent, though it ita wretched bad governMent, a representative government, to be exchanged here in lieu of our limited monarchy, in lieu of our government, under which I state it, with a defiance to the world to tell me that I do not state it truly, that a people never did enjoy, since the providence of God made us a people (you may talk about theories as you please), that they never did enjoy, for so long atime together, such a quantum of actual private happiness and private prosperity, public happiness and public prosperity, under any constitution, as we have enjoyed under the constitution, to the destruction or the support of which it is for you to judge whether such means, as I have been stating to you, were designed to be esuployed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 343 ‘The next thing that was to be done, was to go on in strengthening themselves by affiliation ; and you will fin eager that they have connexions at Norwich, Shefheld, Leeds, and other places: indeed, there was hardly a county, in which they had not affiliated societics, and, if you believe them, to great numbers. The next step they took was, not that they should have it accomplished—their principles would not let them accomplish it—but it was for the purpose of attaching more and more affiliated societies, that they began now to think, in the year 1793, of making applica“tions to parliament. gentlemen, mn the course of that year, 1793, whilst they are to make applications to parliament, you will find that they distinctly discuss the utility of doing so. The London Corresponding Society, it will be proved to you, take the opinion of the socicties in the country with respect to three distinct propositions. Mark this. Now, gentlemen, in September 1792, the Stockport Society told the London Corresponding Society that there was no hope of doing any thing but in a convention; the London Corresponding Society give the answer that I have before stated. They began to think of this thing called a convention in the beginnir g of the year 1793, and they propose having communication, on the other hand, from the country societies. They State three propositions—W hat is it we are to do 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 344  Are we to make an application to parliament ?—Are we to make an application to the king ?—That would have been, to make apPlication to the king, that he would be gra ious'y pleased, according to the oath which be takes upon his coronation, to give his consent to measures, which were to destroy the government of the country, as it exists, and of himself as a part of it! Or are we to have a convention? You will find, when the whole of the evidence is laid before you, there is a vast deal of discussion about this measure of a convention, there is a vast deal of discussion about applying to parliament. The application to the king is thought futile without more debate; but they come to this Metermination, that things are not yet ripe: but that the application to parliament, however, may be one means of ripening that which is not yet mature; and then solicitin petitions from all parts of the kingdom, telling those, from whom they ‘ask them, that they do not mean that they should have any effect, that they are all waste paper; canvassing all parts of the kingdom, and getting sigMatures in the way you will find, they send the petitions to parliament, which, for myself and my posterity, I thank God par-. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 345 liament did not attend to; I mean petitions to introduce a change in the government upon the principle of annual suffrage and universal Tepresentation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 346 They determined for the present that they would content themselves with petitions: that this would occasion a great deal of debate: that that would give them a vast variety of opportunities of discussing the point they had had in agitation since 1792; and, if the public mind was not ripe for a convention in 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 347 1798, the proceedings and transactions of 1793, had a natural and obvious tendency, when these transactions were made a proper use of, to bring to maturity the project, not yet Come to maturity: you will find therefore that both the London maneeyning Eee and the Society for Constitutional Information keep this object in view. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 348 The Norwich Society, upon the 5th of March 1793, write thus to the Society for Constitutional Information, and which you will see had held correspondence also with the London Corresponding Society upon the subject of the same proposition : “ It is with peculiar satisfaction that we are favoured with your correspondence,—they first ssy—“ We wish to find out a method of redress; at present we see a great propriety in universal suffrage and annual elections; but we beg will be obliging enough to inform us of wl you have collected of the sense of the people by your correspondence: we have to inform you that our worthy Corresponding Societies of London have recently submitted three propositions for our investigation ; first, whether a petition to parliament, or an address to the king, or a convention. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 349 When I find here the word convention, I think I may address this question to you as nen of common sense; if, in August 1792, the London Corresponding Society, by the address which I have read to you, have told you distinetly that they cannot get any redress from parliament, is it not marvellous how it is to be made out in argument, that, in March 1793, they were to have a convention in ordet to get it from parliament, and more i larly to get it from that parliament, which, upon their owp principles was not tent to give it, if they had a mind to take it from parliament? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 350 “ Permit us briefly to state our views for your revisal ; and with respect to the first, we behold we are a conquered people; we have tamely submitted to the galling yeke, and resistance in the present circumstances is vain; we cannot, we cannot act the man; and, 88 necessity has no law, we think ourselves under that degrading necessity to state our grievances to the House of Commons, with a request for redress; and should they refuse— which they did—“ to grant our reasonable petition, we have still got (no thanks to them)—here is an accurate, a short descrij tion of the affiliated societies—“ a formidab! engine, that will couvey the insult to the remotest parts of the kingdom: as to the propriety of the second, we wish to submit to your superior judgment, and should esteem it a favour to be informed of the result; fer at Present we are dubious of its good conseuences. Lastly, a cunvention ; and oh! that the period were arrived; but in the present state of affairs, alas! it is impracticable ; yet this is the object we pursue, and esteem any other means only in subordination to, and as having a tendency to accomplish that able end. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 351 “ We wish to be in unison with. our breahren and fellow labvurers, and should be glad of any information, as soon as it is convenient; and we beg your advice whether it is necessary, as soon as possible, to collect signatures to a petition for a real representation of the people 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 352 This letter, of the 5th of March 1793, having been received from Norwich, you will find that Mr. Frost, who had then lately come from France, and was about that time, I believe, talking of no king in this country, in which it is not yet quite lawful to say so, was thought an extremely proper pergon to draw up a letter in answer to this; and accordingly it is stated upon the books of the society, that Mr. Frost was ordered to prepare that answer: however, it got into abler- hands; for, unless i am again misinstructed, it was settled by counsel, and the substance I will now read to you. It is dated the 16th of April 1793. “ From the seeretary of the Society for Constitutional Information to the secretary of the United Political Societies at Norwich
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 353 We have to acknowledge with great satisfaction the letter which you favoured us with, dated the 5th instant, relative to the most desirable of all other objects, the reform of a parliameentary representation. The honour you do us in supposing that we are better fitted than ourselves for the promotion of political know iadees we must disclaim, because we observe with the test pleasure, that our country correspondents have too much zeal and information to want success in their public endeavours, whether at Norwich, at Sheffield, at Manchester, or elsewhere, throughout the nation. In our sincerity for the good of our country we trust that we are all equal, and, as such, we doubt not of our ultimate success. “ We see with sorrow the existence of those evils, which you so justly represent as the streams of corruption overflowing this once free and prosperous country. We see with surprise and abhorrence that men are to be found, both able and willing to support those corruptions. It is, however, no small consolation to find that others are not wanting, in every point of the nation, of an opposite character, who are ready to remedy, by all laudable and honourable means, the defect in our Yepresentation, the usurped extension of the duration of parliaments, and other grievancesSuch as you notice in your letter. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 354 “ That the constitution of England has no more of that character it once possessed ; that the supposed democracy of the country has become a matter of property and privilege ; and that we have therefore no longer that mixed government, which our adversaTies are praising, when they know it is no longer in our possession, are facts notorious and indisputable: where then are we to look for remedy 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 355 most assuredly those who had said on the 6th of August, 1792, they would not louk to parliament, would not be so inconsistent as to say that they would look to it in April 1793—“ to that parliament of which we complain? to the executive power which is implicitly obeyed, if not anticipated in that parliament? or to ourselves ? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 356 Now, who are ourselves? why, those affiliated societies! “ ourselves represented in some meeting of delegates for the extensive purpose of reform, which-we suppose you understand by the term convention. The Norwich Society writes to the Constitutional Society, and it proposes a convention as the only means of doing this business. The Constitutional Society states that it is to be done only in a convention,—of what? of themsclves. Why then, I say, upon the 16th of April, 1798, the Constitutional Society construed the acts of the 20th of January, 1794, which I shall allude to presently, and the 27th of March, 1794, because the Constitutional Society, said that a convention was a convention of themselves, represented in some meeting of delegates,—and for what purpose ? for the extensive purposes of reform; how ? byapplyingtoparliament? No. Why, thispassage states expressly that the reason why they would have a convention was, because they would not apply to parliament; and canIimpute to men of understanding, that are employed in this business, for there ere merf of understanding enough employed in this business; whether that understanding is. properly employed in this business, it is not for me to say any thing about—can I impute any thing so absurd to men of understanding as that they meant to form a convention, which convention should carry their petition to parliament? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 357 t is the end of each of these propositions that we ought to look to; and, as success in a good cause must be the effect of perseverance and the rising reason of the time, let us determine with coolness, but Ict us persevere with decision. As to a convention, we regard it as a plan the most desirable and most practicable ;—when? so soon as the great body of the people shall be virtuous enough to joinusin the attempt? No—but “so soon as the great hody of the people shall be courageous and virtuous enough to join usin the attempt. You will see whether the interpretation which I give of the word “ courageous by the manner in which I mean to expressit, is due to it or not, by what I have to state to you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 358 Gentlemen of the jury, with a view to explain this thing called a convention, as contradistinguished from parliament, give me leave to carry back, your attention for a moment to January 25, 1793. In this society, which, in November, 1792, had the correspondence with France, which I stated, in January, 1793, when we were on the eve ofa war, and upon the eve of a war which had been produced by the “principles which brought fraternization into’ this, country, and took place soon after that decree of 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 359 November,. 1792, you will find that these resolutions were come to “ That citizen St. Andre, a member of the National Convention of France,—that convention which had deposed a king, as that which could not exist ina government, formed upon the principles of the rights of man, as disclosed by Mr. Paine, his fellow-member in that convention,—“ as one of the most judicious and enlightened friends of human liberty, be admitted an associated honorary member of this society
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 360 Resolved That citizen Barrere, a member of the National Convention of France, being considered by us as one of the most judicious and enlighteaed friends of human hans be admitted an associated honorary member of this society. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 361 “ Resolved, that citizen Roland, being also considered by us as one of the most judicious and enlightened friends of human liberty, be admitted an associated honorary member. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 362 Gentlemen, I particularly request your attention to this—“ that the speeches of citizen St. Andre and citizen Barrere, associated honorary members of this society, as given in the Gazette Nationale, ou Moniteur universel of Paris, on the 4th, 6th, and 7th of January, 1793, be inserted in the books of this society ;—and, as far as this society could effectuate it, they endeavoured also to have these resolutions, lished in the newspapers, and it will be 1n proof to you that, in the books of the society, it is resolved that each of these resolutions should be so published. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 363 Now, gentlemen, I shall prove to you, by evidence completely effectual for that purpose, what these speeches were, and then, if you will be so good as to ask yourselves what the Constitutional Society, which in January and February ordered these speeches to be published, meant by a convention in that letter of the 16th of April, 1793, you will judge whether that convention was to be the means Vege they would neither apply to the ing, the executive power, nor to the parliament), was to be the means of handing their application to parliament or whether, on the other hand, it was to be the means of introducing by its own force, a representative procrmnent in this country? that assembly, which you will find, they insist would for the time absorb all the powers of government, which, if it did exist, would delegate its legislative power only so long as they chose to delegate it, a body competent to create a legislature, and possessing within itself an eternal power of reform, an eternal source of revolution. With respect to St. Andre, speaking to the convention, he says, “ Your right to decide the fate of kings arises from your being a revolutionary assembly created by the nation —a- revolutionary assembly created by the nation in such a state is at least that thin which I think no good Englishman ever wil wish to exist to see—“ a revolutionary assembly, created by the nation in a state of insurrection. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 364 Speaking of the trial of the king of France, mee This proceeding is of the highest importance to public order, absolutely necessary to the existence of liberty, aud connected with whatever is held most sacred by the nation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 365 he people of Paris—This is upon the question whether the person of the king be ioviolable, a maxim unquestionably true ia the constitution of this country, a maxiot perfectly consistent with the civil liberties of the people, because, though the king’s person is inviolable, he has advisers, who are violable as to every act that he does—“ The people of Paris, by making a boly insurrection against the king on the 10th of Angie —that 10th of August, which, in Mr. t's letter to Mr. Tooke, was absolutely necessary to the existence of liberty in France—“ deigs him of his character of inviolability. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 366 he people of the other departments, applauded this insurrection, and adopted the consequence of it. The people have therefore formally interposed to destroy this royal inviolability. The tacit consent of the Lk rendered the person of the king inviolable; the act of insurrection—I pry heaven defend us from the operation of such principles in this country—“ the act of insurzection was a tacit repeal of that consent, and was founded on the same grounds of law as the consent itself; the king’s person is inviolable only with relation to the other branches of the legislature, but not with relation to the people. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 367 Now, I ask, what did those gentlemen, who ordered this speech to be published, that the king’s person is inviolable only with relation to the other branches of the legisla ture, when they were talking of conventions, mean? Iam sorry to say that my mind is drawn to the conclusion that they thought the king’s person was not inviolable with ree lation to the people, a convention of whons was to be formed, and was to be formed because an application to parliament was useless. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 368 Now, let us see the description of a convention. “ A convention differs from an ot dinary legislature in this respect: a legisla ture is only a species of superintending magistracy, a moderator of the powers of government: a convention is a perfect representation of the sovereign: the members of the legislativeassembly acted in August upon these principles, in sammoning the conyention; they declare—precisely as it is declared in the letter I have been reading to you—“ that they saw but one measure which could seye France, namely, to have recourse to the supreme will of the people, and to invite the yee to exercise immediately that upalienale right of sovereignty, which: the constitu: tion had acknowledged, and which it could not subject to any restriction: the public interest required that the people should manifest their will by the election of a Nasional 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 369 Convention, formed of representatives in vested by the people with unlimited powers. The people did manifest their will by the election of that convention. The convention being assembled is itself that sovereign will which ought to prevail. It would be contrary to every principle to suppose that the convention js not alone exclusively the expression of the general will. i 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 370 “¢ The powers of the convention must, from the very nature of the assembly, be unlimited with respect to every measure of general safety, such as the execution of a tyrant. It is no longer a convention, if it has not power to judge the king: a convention is a constituent body, i. e. a body that is to make a constitution ior the people; a legislature makes laws ler an established constitution, and in conformity to it. It is despotism when, in the ordinary and permanent establishment ofa state, there is no separation of powers ; but it is of the very essence of a constituent body to concentre ‘be the time all authority: it is the very nature of a national convention, to be the tempo image of the nation, to unite in itself all the powers of the state, to saploy them against the enemies of liberty, and to distribute them in a new social compact called a constitution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 371 Gentlemen, after I have stated that to you, I think I cannot possibly be mistaken when I conceive that you can do no otherwise than put the same construction upon this letter which I did. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 372 I will now take the liberty of calling your attention to a letter of the 17th of May 1793, and the answer of the 26th May 1793, passing over a tt many letters, the substance of which you will inform yourselves of by having read, namely, letters that prove affiliations solicited and granted to Leeds, Tewkesbury, Coventry, and many places in the kingdom, more numerous than I apprehend bt will believe, till you see what the numof them is, by evidence actually before 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 373 Re ou. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 374 Gentlemen, I beg leave now to call your attention, in order of time, to a letter of the 17th May 1793, for it begins a correspondence Most excessively material with that part of country in which the convention has been already held ; I mean Scotland; a convention which, I think I shall satisfy you, did, for the time, act upon the principles that I have stated to you, from the speech of Barrere, as far as it could act, and in which I think, at the moment that I address you, if it had not been stopped in the execution of its purposes, and had been joined by those whose acts we are considering this day, you might have seen, in the speeches of a national convention in Great Britain, a repetition of the language of Barrere, instead of hearing it from me in a court of justice. Gentlemen, I hold it, in the office that I fill, to be due to the administration of the jus
ATTORNEYGENERAL 375 Uce of this country, to say distinctly, if 1 un- i derstand the case upon which certain persons were tried for the acts which they did in Scotland, that, if they had been tried tor high treason, they would have no right to complain; no right to complain if the question upon their conduct had been agitated in that shape before a jury of the Sout Gentlemen, upon the 17th of May, a Mr. Urquhart going from London, Mr. Hardy, and a Persea of the name of Margarot, celebrated in the future history of this business, join, and write a letter—parliament had, as the expected it would, and as they meant it should, rejected their petition—he London Cor. responding Society eagerly seizes the opportunity of Mr. Urquhart going back to Edinburgh, to request of your society a renewal of correspondence, and a more intimate co-operation in that which both societies alike seck, viz. a reform in the parliamentary representation. We are very sensible that no society can by itself bring about that desirable end : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 376 let us, therefore, unite as much as possible, not only with each other, but with every other society throughout the nation. Our petitions, you will have learned, have bean all of them unsuccessful: our attention must now, therefore, be turned to some more effectual means; from your suciely we would wil. lingly learn them, and you, on your part, may depend upon our adopting the firmest measures, provided they are constitutional, and we hope the country will not be behindhand with us. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 377 Now, by “constitutional measures, it is clear that they meant that a convention, as contradistinguished from a parliament, would be constitutional: it is clear they meant it, because they have said it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 378 Then Mr. Skirvingwrites thus — “ Mr. Urquhart did me the pleasure to call on Thursday afternoon, and delivered your letter of the 17th inst. I am much pleased with the contents of it, and shall lay it before the first meeting of our societies here, which, however, does not take place till Monday sevennight. I would have acknowledged the receipt of your favour by yesterday’s post, but was tou much employed in removing our household to another leising to attend to any thing else. NowI beg your attention to this, because you will see in the transactions of the ople in convention in Edinburgh, that they looked to what they were todo in case of a rebellion as well as any other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 379 feither you in England or we in Scotland should attempt separately, the reform which we, I trust, seek to obtain, we should, by so doing, only expose our weakness, and manifest our ignorance of the corruption which opposes our important undertaking ; if we sought only the extirpation of one set of interested men from the management of national affairs, that place might be given to another set; without affecting the vitals adverse to the system of reform, these might be easily accomplished: but to cut up deep and wide rooted prejudices, to give effectual ener, to the dictates of truth in favour of public virtue and national prosperity, in opposition to self and all its interested habits, and to withstand and overawe the final efforts of the powers of darkness, is the work of the whole, and not ofa part; a work to which mankind till this awfu' poe were never adequate, because never till pow disposed to fraternize, not merely or only, I trust, from the sense of the common danger to which we are exposed, but from the ennobling principle of universal benevolence. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 380 I know no greater service that I can do my country, than to promote the union you so wisely desire: and I am happy to assure you, that I have bitherto discovered no sentiment in our association, adverse to the most intimate and brotherly union with the associations in England. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 381  think the minds of all must in the nature of things be now turned to more effectual soa of reform. Not one person was convinced of the necessity of it by the most convincing arguments of reason, together with the most unequivocal expressions of universal desire. What then is to be hoped for from repetition? Iam only afraid that the bow in England against reform was so contracted, that in returning it may break. You would willingly learn, you say, from us—I own that we ought to be forward in this: we have at once in great wisdom perfected our plan of organization, and if we were in the same independent state of mind as the people of England, we would be able to take the lead, the associations with you are no more, I fear, excuse my freedom, than an aristocracy for the good of the people: they are indeed moderate, firm, and virtuous, and better cannot be; but we are the people themselves, and we are the first to show that the people can both Jute and resolve, if undirected by faction, with both wisdom and moderation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 382 “I have not a higher wish in the present exertions for reform than to see the people universally and regularly associated, because Tam persuaded that the present disastrous engagements will issue in ruin, and the people must then provide for themselves; and it would be unhappy when we should be ready to act with unanimity, to be occupied about organization, without which, however, anarchy must ensue—we will not need but to be prepared for the event—to stand still and see the salvation of the Lord—let us therefore take the hint given us by our opposers; let us begin in earnest to make up our -minds relative ig Pe extent of aber which r ought to seek, be prepared to justify it, and to controvert objections : let us model the whole in the public mind; let us provide every stake and stay of the tabernacle which we would erect, so that when the tabernacles of oppression in the ‘palaces of ambition are brokea down, under the madness and folly of their supporters, we may then, without anarchy aud all dangerous delay, erect at once our tabernacle of righteousness, and may the Lord himself be in it! 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 383 Gentlemen, these are things all very easy tobeunderstood. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 384 “ How hurtful to the feelings of a reflecting mind, to look back to the wretched state in which the Roman monarchy, eafeebled and broken by its own corruptions, left the nations, which it subjected, like sheep without a shepherd; they soon became a prey to every invader, because there was mone to gather and unite them; had they, foreseeing the evil, associated for mutual defence, -no robber would have been able to enslave them ; would have given laws to all parties, as as to themselves: all separate colonies and nations would have sought their alliance ; but not having virtue to associate, and heal the divisions, and root out the selfish spirit, which ambition-fostering governments procure to their subjects, they fell under oppressions, from under whose iron sceptre they have never yet been able to deliver themselves. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 385 “ We may suppose an event, which we deprecate; nay, should we not be prepared for every possible issue of the present unprecedented divisions of- mankind, we have a right to be apprehensive of the abilities of our own managers, who are so afraid to depart from recedent, that, like men of detail, they may e inadequate to the task of preserving the vessel from shipwreck, now grappling with danger not only great, but new and uncommon. If the present ministry fail, who after them shall be trusted? It requires little peNnetration to see the anarchy and discord which will follow; it will be such, teh thing short of a general union ai people themselves, will be able to heals baste therefore to associate, at least to be to associate; if, then, such a broken state of things should take place, the civil broils that ane necessarily ensue, would soon subside before the united irresistible voice of the whole. Do not, I entreat you, hesitate’ thinking such a work premature as yet,— this is written in May 1793; but a month, and then it may be too late; a malignant party may be already formed, and only waiting for the halting of the present menagers; it will then be too late to seek to subject to deliberation, after a party has dared the act of rebellion. Jf you go po further than separate meetings in different towns, we will not be able to confide in yous con fraternity, because while in such a state you may be but the tools of a faction; we have all confidence and unite with all affection in one assembly of commissioners from all countries of the world. Gentlemen, observe that expressica ; this letter, in the beginning of it, speaking with reference to the war, does. not know but the palaces of ambition may be all overset; the illars will tumble with’ their supporters. Then it says, “ we could have all confidence and unite with all affection in one assembly commissioners from all countries of the world —if we knew they were chosen by the unbiassed voice of the people, because they would come up with the same disinterested views and desires as ourselves, having all to a common centre of union and interest; but we could not confide in fellowcitizens, who kept aloof from such union, and would not previously affiliate in one great and indivisible family. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 386 Gentlemen, I have befote told you, that there was a society at Birmingham. Upon the 10th of June 1793, the London Corresponding Society writes to that Society in these terms: “ it is with singular satisfaction the Committee of the London Corresponding Society received your letter; they are very giad to see the spirit of freedom springing up in Birmingham, and they make no doubt but that the zeal of your Society and the increase of your numbers will soon do away the stigma thrown on your town by the unjustifiable behaviour of a Church and King mob: ‘we are entirely of your opinion. with regard to the necessity of a general union, and we believe, as you do, that when once the country shall have so united,—what then? “ the Neroes of the day will be forced to yield to the an demand of a long and sore oppressed entlemen, the political societies at Norwich also write to the London Corresponding Society with respect to this Convention upon the 25th of June 1793, in which they say, “ we also received your friendly letter prior to that wherein you stated three propositions: first, a petition to his majesty, or to parliaament, or a national convention; and ordered one of our committee to answer it ; should be glad if you will inform me whether it was attended to.’ I gave my opinion on the subJect to the Constitutional Society of London, and found their ideas congenial to my own, —thatalludes to the letter they wrote him,—viz. an address to the king—futile; a petition to parliament (as a conquered people)— tolerable; a national convention GE crutenstances admitted), best of all. ‘Gentlemen, you will find that, upon the 28th of June 1793, whilst these societies were holding so much correspondence with y Tespect to thie national convention, as the only effectual mcans, it was thought an address to the nation should be prepared: that is not immaterial, because you will find afterwards, that the project of a national convention in Scotland was thought by many of the members of it, and many of the members of those bodies, to have failed for want of such a previous address to the nation; and upon this occasion two gentlemen are brought. together, I do not know whether one of them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 387 at that time was s member of the society or not, but two members are brought together, Mr. Horne Tooke and a borer of the name of Yorke, who, you will find, was a delegate ofto the convention in Scotland, and who you will find has acted a considerable other parts of this country, were to ployed in preparing that address. Upon the 6th of July 1793, a letter havin; been feceived from the political socintes de Norwich, theanswer, signed by the prisoner at the bar, is given in these terms':“Fellow-citizens, the London Cotresponding Society have received, and: read with pleasure, your letter of the 25th of Jane ;' bit the answer, which you mention to‘have been made to our three questions, has not by come to hand; we shall be glad to be i formed by your next whether it was ever ‘put in the post-office. i “ie 6 “With regard‘te the questions themselves, however individuals may have made up thelr mitids on them, the public seeincd most to approve the mode of petitioning parliament. Then it states the effect oF the petitions, ‘“ Exhorting you therefore to throw aside all unavailing complaint, we wish you to occupy yourselves in instructing the people, in intrdducing and maintaining order and regularifs in your own society, and in forming a junctio’ with all others associated for the same putpose throughout the nation, by keeping up’a constant correspondence with them; but, above all, orderly and courageously preparin yourself for the event,"—now mark the event,— “ for, as it is natural to suppose that those, who now pe on the public, will not willingly yield up their enjoyments, nor repossess us of our rights without a struggle, which by their be haviour in Ireland,—that alludes to the bill in Ireland to prevent a convention,—" wehave some reason to think they are meditating, and perhaps may intend to effect by means of those Joreign mercenaries, who ure now paid by the sweat of our brow, and whom, under some plausible pretence, it would be no difficult ! matter to land on our shore: it may be morepantageous to humanity to show them at firstthat their opponents are neither mob nor rabble, but an indignant oppressed people, in wham is not yet entirely extinct the valour of their foree fathers. . A e gentlemen, in a letter to Hertford, which is written by the same Correspending Society, upon the Sist of July 1793, and which Socie' at Hertford had desired to know their princt ples, they state themselves in the same manner; “ We receive with pleasure your assurance of co-operating with us fora reform in parliament, en object to which all our endeavours tend, and on which our hearts arp invariably fixed; but as your declaration that you will not pledge yourselves to demand universal suffrage and annual parliaments, is followed by no specific plan of reform of your another set; without affecting the vitals ad-sion in’ the ‘palaces “of verse to the system of reform, these might bedown, under the easily accomplished: but to cut up deep and supporters, we may. wide rooted prejudices, to give effectual energyand all dangerous to the dictates of truth in favour of publictabernacle of righ’ . virtue and national prosperity, in opposition tohimself be in it 0 ee..self and all its interested habits, and to with- gentlemen, theseare stand and overawe the final efforts of theto be understood. i powers of darkness, is the work of the whole,“ How hurtful to th and not ofa part ; a work to which mankinding mind, to look bac! —

ATTORNEYGENERAL 405 ‘. In October 1798, the Scotch Convention having met, of which we have all of us heard 80 Touch out of this place, you will find that a etter had been received from a Mr. Sinclair, together with an address from Sirving who Was secretary to the Convention and Friends of the People in Scotland, by the London Constitutional Society; an extraordi meeting of the Society was therefore called, by the Crown and Anchor, to consider the wtility and propriety of sending delegates to a convention of delegates. of the different societies in Great Britain, at Edinburgh, for the purpose of obtaining a parliamentary reform. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 406 Upon the 28th of October 1798, this society came to a resolution to send delegates to that convention, and the two persons elected were Mr. Sinclair and Mr. Yorke; and perhaps one cannot state a more striking. instance of the extraordinary power of a small society, afflating itself with societies, spread all over the whole kingdom, than by stating that Sinclair, who was deputed from this society, meeti with other delegates in Scotland, bad no di culty of assuming with others the title of a delegate to the British Convention—to assert their right to do acts in contradiction to the legislature—than by telling you, that this Yorke and Sinclair were deputed from this society by a poll, in which he, who had the majority, had seventeen votes only; My. Yorke and Mr. Sinclair are accordingly scot down, and they go with all the delegation of the power of the people, which this Constitutional Society, thus affiliated, could give them, and what they thought it was you will see presently
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 407 The London Corresponding Society was not to be backward in torming this Convention in Scotland—and, accotdingly, you will see in the evidence, which I have to state to you, a considerable deal of contrivance on the part of the prisaner at the bar, in order to bring about that convention in Scotland; for, gentlemen, he writes letter to the ‘Norwich Constitutional Society, which deserves your very serious attention, in which he expresses himself thus—“ We have to acknowledge, at once, your favours of the Srd of September and 14th instant; utopia: of business prevented my answesing your first, but will now inform you that the spirit, shown in it, gave great satisfaction to our society at large. The rejoicings for the capture of Valenciennes were not confined to Norwich alone: the ignorant every where else throughout the nation betrayed their imbecility on the occasion—the taking of a town, the slaughtering of thousands. of bumaa beings, the laying waste whole provinces, or the enslaving a nation (however great evils they may be), can only retard for a small space of time the progress of truth and reason. Be not disheartened therefore; pursue your plan, instruct mankind, and constitutionally set your faces against existing abuses; be assured that many are our friends, who opportunity to openly join us, while our cnemies have much enfeebled themselves and their cause y their arbitrary exertions; despotism is at its last 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 408 ‘gasp—one or two caurpaigns more will terminate its existence. “We are glad to see that you ‘begin to make a proper use of delegation; where 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 409 ‘bodies of men are too numerous to be convened easily on every occasion, delegation is 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 410 “the best, and indeed the only way to obtain the general opinion. Scotland, iniproving on the idea, have ot only summoned their tw delegates, but also invite those of every other society to attend a kind of convention (as if Mr. Hardy knew nothing about it), “ which is to be held at Edinburgh on the 29th instant, the enclosed paper, which I, previous to the communicating your letter to our committee (which will meet only to-morrow), make haste to tranemit to you, will show you that your society is included in the general invitation to send delegates to that peste which we exhort you to do. if you possibly can; I firmly believe our society will not miss the opportunity of doing the same. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 411 ‘Now you will find that, upon the 5th of October 1793, Hardy, who wrote this letter upon the 17th, wrote to Skirving in this way 2—“ With pleasure I peruse your favour of the 2ad instant, but, as yet, have scen nor heard nothing ‘of the two copies’ of Mr. Muir’s trial, which you mention as being sent to the society and to myself—be kind enough, notwithstanding, to return that gentleman thanks for his polite attention, and assure him that we view him in the light of a martyr to freedom, as well as Mr. Palmer, and that our warmest bh are, that the oppressors of mankind will either be ashamed or afraid of carrying their revengeful malice into executron 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 412 «The General Convettion, which you mention, appears to Mr. Margarot (to whom alone E have communicated your letter) and myself te be a very excellent measure, und as such, I cordd wish you, without delay, to communicate it officially to our society without any ways mentraning thut have written to me prisutely— if in your official letter you should sequire us 80 send a deputation to that meeting, I have no doubt tut our society would, with pleasure, accept the invitation ; andIain persuaded it may do much good
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 413 Our freedom, as you justly observe, depends entirely upon ourselves; and upon our availing ourselves of this opportunity, which, once Jost, may not be Becovered so soon. I am glad to discover by your testimony that Iwas by no ways mistaken in the high opinion T always bad of Lord Daer’s patriotism: a title may be a bar te disinterested partriotism, but it seems he has evinced it not to be an insuperable one. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 414 You are right; itis true, that we ‘have hed another general meeting, at which a hastily composed and suddenly produced address to the king was read, applauded, and tobe presented ; but, on a cool revisal, the said address being found to be more 1iPnabired om spirited, more dengerous in its lan e, than advantageous in its object, feaider being too long, the committee, with the approbation of the majority of the society, have adopted anomuch safer, more apposite, relating solely to the war: enclosed you have a copy of it; but-you was misinformed when you was, told we passed any resolutions at that meeting, for we only came to one, and that rather of a private nature, namely, that the conduct of sir James Sanderson, in preventing ‘the meeting of the London’ Corresponding ‘Society, at. the Globe tavern, Fleet street, was of such’ a nature s to place him below our censure. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 415 Gentlemen, the London Constitutional -Society gave their delegates, Mr. Yorke and Mr. Sinclair, certain instructions: and I ought’ here to tell you, -by way of explaining the effect of whatam now to state, that the’ manner of ‘keeping the books of the London Constitutional Society, as I understand it, was this—The resolutions, made upon one night,’ were taken upon loose minutes, either by the’ secretary, or by other persons, who acted in his absence, or in his presence, when he was not. doing that duty himself: they were entered before the subsequent night of meeting, regularly. in the book, and the first thing done upon the' subsequent night of meeting was to read the’ resulutions which were made upon the former night, and to see that they were correct: now it will naturally occur that the minutes may explain the book, and the book may explain the minutes: now, when they come to drawthe minutes, which you will have for the insteuction of their delegates ata convention, which was to be held in Scotland, the first’ ided was, toinstruct those delegates, to petition parliament; but they seem to have recollected that that wasa measure, which had been’ abandoned some months before by all the societies with whom they were affiliated: they therefore struck out of their minutes the purpose of applying to parliament, and they send instructions in these words : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 416 “ The delegates are instructed, on the part of the society, ty assist in bringing forward and supporting any constitutional measures fer procuring a real representation of theCommons of Great Hritain in parliament— that, in specifying the redress to be demanded of existing abuses, the delegates ought never! to lose sight of the two essential principles, general suffrage and annual representation, together with the unalienable right in the poopie to reform, and that a reasonable and nown compensation ought to be made to‘ the representatives of the nation by a national contribution. What they meant by the representatives of the nation, after what I have already read to you, I think you cannot possibly mistake. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 417 London Correspanding Society are’ somewhat bolder in the instructions, which they send with their delegates to the convention in Scotland : you will find these instructions are to the following effect : By article the 1st, the delegate is instructed “ that he shallon no account depart from the original object and principle of this society; namely, the obtaining annua! parliaments, and universal suffrage, by rational and lawful means. 2d. To support the-opinions that representatives in parliament ought to be. paid by their constituents, : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 418 ““7th, That itis the duty of the people now, gentlemen, I beg your attention to this; it is the principle, upon which the convention in Scotland was formed, and upon which it acted: “ That it is the duty of the people to resist uny act of parliament, repugnant to the original principles of the constitution, as would be every attempt to prohibit associations for the purpose of reform. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 419 Gentlemen, there is no government in this country, if this principle is to be acted upon, because nobody can tell to what extent it will Bo and accordingly you will see that these lelegates, who went into Scotland, with this authority in their hands, carried the authotity far beyond the resistance, which they were authorized to make according to the principles t:ere laid down, and they state a preat variety of cases, all approved afterwards oth by the London Corresponding, and the Constitutional Society, in which the people, and the convention of the people, were to resist parliament. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 420 Gentlemen, these societies having sent delegates to the conyention in Scotland, I proceed now to state that the acts of that convention, to the extent at least to which the delegates from this country were authorized to act, are evidence against those who sent them and therefore against the persons here indicted. But farther, they communicated to the societies here, particularly to the prisoner at the bar, their acts; and the societies here, in distinct resolutions, acting upon consideration, approved their whole conduct: they therefure made that conduct of their delegates in the convention in Scotland, whether it was agrecable to the original authority which was given them, or not, their own; they adopted ut by giving it their subsequent approbation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 421 Gentlemen, you will find, first of all, that they received a letter from the Sheffield Society, athliating with them, in which it was Proposed to determine like Englishmen. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 422 After receiving a great deal of other correspondence, which I will not trouble you with reading, the societies here prepare to send delegates to Scotland. Mr. Skirving sent a circular letter upon the arrival of the English delegates to the delegates of all the associations in Scotland, which were extremely numerous, and very widely extended; and I think the delegates of these difterent societies came together to the number of one hundred and eighty. After sitting some time, Mr. Marrot, you will find, who was the delegate of the London Corresponding Society, represents to the body there met—“ That the societies in London were very numerous, though sometumes fluctuating ; that in some part of England whole towns are reformers: that in Sheffield and the environs there are fifty thousand ; that in Norwich there are thirty societies in one; that if they could get a convention of England and Scotlan , they might represent six or seven hundred thousand males, which is a majority of all the adults in the kingdom. — 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 423 You will find Mr. Margarot moves, that, previous to publishing an address to the public a committee should be appointed to consider the means, and draw up a plan of general union and co-operation—between what? Not between any societies in the two nations, but a plan of general union and co-operation between the two nations. In their constitutional parent of a theory of parliamentary reform, they stylejthemselvesa convention, and this, gentlemen, is extremely material for Pi to attend to; they style themeelves, “ The British Convention of the delegates of the people associated to obtain universal s and annual parliaments. Then I ask what is a convention of the people according to these societies? According to the proceedings in Scotland, a convention of the people is a convention of the delegates from s0cieties in England and Scotland. They assert that the people have in them all civil and political authority; and they, repeatedly, again and again, from the moment that this convention was formed in Scotland to the moment of its dispersion, more especially at the time of its dispersion, more especially still from the time of its dispersion tll the time of a meeting on the 20th of January, at the Globe tavern; and on the 27th of March, when another convention was proposed, as I stated at the outset, they repeatedly and in the most pressing terms state that now or never was the time, when the people were to meet, when they were to act by their own force, when they were courageously to prepare themselves for the event, and to show those whom they called their oppressors and plunderers, that they were a brave people, in whom valour was not extinct. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 424 Having thus met together, upon the principles of the French system, which took place on the 10th of. August 1792, they proceed directly to the French practices, which took place then in the National Assembly of France, took place then hecause the people of France were understood to be represented by aconvention ; these delegates taking upon themselves also to be aconvention of the people, they instituted Primary Societies, they divided the country into departments, they appointed provincial assemblies, they have Committees of Union, they thank for patriotic donations, they assume an epoch, they appoint a Secret Committee to be called together upon extraordinary emergencies; and upon the 28th of November 1793, they come toa resolution, to which I must beg your most serious attention. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 425 Gentlemen of the jury, you will remember that they went with authorities, which stated to them that it was the duty of the people, which people they had taken upon themselves to represent, to resist any act of parliament, that should be made for a parti purpose. It is hardly, I think, to be contended, that the pat bulk of the people of this country, ; ing wrongous imprisonment and against unppy in their political existence, as undoubtedly they are, remaining happy in their political existence, because they do not teel grievances (till they are taught by malignant industry to believe that they exist), I mean to such a degree as to call for measures of this sort, could believe that the legislature of the country, doing justice to the subjects, whoin it is bound to protect, would permit a proceeding of this kind to go on—yet, gentlemen, confiding su much as these persons did in the supposed state of their number-in that coun- ; try, and of those who were to be connected with them in this, you will find that, upon the 28th of November 1793, one of the persons belonging to that convention, citizen Sinclair, I think, the members all standing up upon their feet, for the greater solemnity of the thing, proposes this resolution— Resolved that the following declaration and resolutions be inserted at the end of our minutes—“ That this convention—now if it be possible to say that any convention means to act asa con- , yention of the people, it is that which sets itselfabove the legislature in the act it is doing —“ that this convention, considering the ca-lamitous consequences of any act of the legislature, which may tend to deprive the whole or any part of the people of their undoubted right to meet, either by themselves or by delegation, to discuss any matter relative to their common interest, whether of a public or private nature, and holding the same to be totally inconsistent with the first principles and safety of society, and also subversive of our known and acknowledged constitutional liberties
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 426  
ATTORNEYGENERAL 427 Gentlemen, permit me to. call your attention to this, that this declaration, in its principles, follows the instructions that they had teceived, that, if any attempt was made to bring in a convention bill, they were then to doso and so. They then proceed thus—“ do declare before God and the world, that we shall tollow the wholesome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act, which shall militate against the constitution of our country’—That 1s saying, that the will of the legislature is not a better judge of what is an act against the constitution of the country, than the affiliated clubs at Edinburgh—“ and shall continue to assemble and consider of the best means by which we can accomplish a teal representation of the people, is that a parliament 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 428 “ and annual election, until— ae ?— until compelled to desist by superior force. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 429 “ And we do resolve that the first notice fiven—The first notice—parliament is not even to discuss the thing; but, if an intimation of it ismade in parliament—“ That the notice given for the introduction of a conYention bill, or any bill of a similar tendency to that passed in Ireland in the last session of their parliament, or any bill for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus act, or the act for preventdue delays in trials in North Britain, or in case of an invasion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 430 Gentlemen, I call back to your recollection the letter of Skirving—I call back to your recollection not only the letter of Skirving, but that the troops of liberty were promised to be sent with bayonets and pikes from that country, which at this moment was likely to invade us—“ or the admission of any foreign troops whatsoever, into Great Britain or Ire land—If the parliament of this country, for the purpose of protecting itself against that foreign invasion, had brought these foreign troops into Great Britain or Ireland, not being the troops of a nation with which we were at war, this convention of the people was to act upon the introduction of such foreign troops in the same manner as they would act in case of an invasion by those who were at war with us—What is the construction that follows upon that
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 431 that, even if foreign troops, to meet the exigence of an invasion, were introduced—what then ?—“ all or any one of these calamitous circumstances—why calamitous ? they might be necessary for the very existence of the country—“ shall be a signal to the several delegates to repair to such place as. the secret committee of this convention shall appoint, and the first seven members shall have power’—to do what?—to do that exactly, which a national convention in France would do—“ to declare the sittings permanent’—why? Because the duly constituted legislature of the country had dared, not to do an act, but to entertain a deliberation upon doing an act—the first notice was to call together this convention, and being called together, their sittings were to be permanent. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 432 Gentlemen, are the parties tu this convention in Scotland such men, as would think of bringing themselves together to declare their sittings permanent upon such a gout as they state here, namely, the legislature of a great country acting in the execution of the great duties which belong to the legislature of that country, without supposing, by that solemn declaration, that they could make their meeting effectual by the acts which were to be carried on for the purpose of preventing that legislature from deliberating upon such duties? By what acts could it be done but by exertions, as they style them, in the manner of their forefathers, by force? By affiliated societies, exerting their physical strength that physical exertion, which Mr. Barlow observes is to be preceded or presided by spreading useful knowledge, and that useful knowledge, being that which is to beat down the existing authority of King, Lords, and Commons. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 433 “ The convention therefore resolve, that each delegate immediately on his return home do convene his constituents, and explain to them the necessity of electing a delegate or delegates, and of establishing a fund without delay, against any of these emergencies, for his or their expense, and that they do instruct the said delegate or delegates to hold themselves ready. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 434 Gentlemen, you see what they expected from the legislature—they knew that what they were doing ought to provoke the legisTature to do what they meant to forbid the legislature to do: and they instruct their delegate or delegates to hold themselves read: —“ to depart at one hour’s warning. Well ight Mr. Skirving say, that a month's delay, ged ile whole was lost : well might Mr. Hardy say, sie he ort in lettersabel produce presently, that i opportunity is lost now, it is lost for ever—we must act now, or we never can. Having some reason to suppose that this convention would be dispersed, they then with great solemnity come to another resolution : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 435 “ That the moment of any illegal dispersion of the British Convention shall be considered as a summons to the delegates to repair to the place of meeting appointed for the convention of emergency hy the Secret Committee, and that the Secret Committee be instructed without delay to proceed to fix the place of meeting. gentlemen, after these resolutions it became necessary to do a little more, that is, to declare upon what principles this conyeniee existed. Now mar ue inciples, and do your country justice; a Laren of the puarseliane tae Thave mate to you, as are worthy your attention, to what I have beture stated as the necessary connexion between the principle and practice of Mr. Paine, and of these societies. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 436 Gentlemen, these principles brought together the French Convention—what is the ractice then, that flows-out of the principle? hy, it is the assembling of a convention upon principles obliging it to sit for the purpose of declaring that the eeilelne shall do nothing but what they liked: that is to all intents and purposes a National Convention ; if not a convention for an eternal reform, at least a convention, that probibits the legislature to do any thing but what is agreeable to them. Then having met for the execution of the practice, they proceed immediately to the declaration of the principle—but they do not proceed to a declaration of the principle, till they have done that strong and solemn act, which I have stated: then they resolve “ that acommittee be appointed to draw up a declaration’—This is France exactly—It is the Southwark Society in 1792—“ a declaration of the natural imprescriptible rights of man, and that the same be prefixed to an address to the people of Great Britain. That a committee of observation, that is, for the better effectuating the purpose that they had before declared, ““be appointed in London to give the earliest intimation of any motion of the kind mentioned in the foregoing resolutions to the different societies. You will then find that they met in a place, which they call Convention Hall, under the wt name of the British Convention, and then they are informed that the London Corresponding Society would undertake tobe that committee of observation, which, they say, ought to exist —and then you will find that the members mentioned that they had thousands of their constituents in London, Sheffield, Norwich, eds, &c. and that the convention was to look at itself as in its true nature a Committee of the people—that therefore it was necessary to have, as they have in France Primary Societies, who shall be consulted—in other words, that this committee of the pores Edinburgh, which was to overrule the ogi lature, was itself to be overruled by these Primary Societies, these primary societies themselves being overruled by the leaders of the great clubs, from which they emanated, and so forming in this country a government, under the power of a Jacobin Club, and that ereounen destroying the present existing legislature of the kingdom. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 437 You will also find that, before these persons parted, Mr. Margarot communicated to his constituents the proceedings of this body, which he styles always the Convention of t People associated to obtain annual parliaments and universal suffrage. There are letters which I shall lay before you, without detailing them, stating that they looked up to the London Corresponding Society, and the Society for Constitutional Information— that their active exertions were necessary for the accomplishing the projects, which the: sitting in Edinburgh were to execute; aad then the two delegates of the London Corresponding Society write to Mr. Hardy, as the secretary of that society, an account of their proceedings—they give him an account of that solemn motion, and of the manner of making it, which I have just been detailing to you—they state to him that they had determined to assemble in convention in any such case— that the appointment of the place, which is a circumstance I beg your most serious attention to, was left to a Secret Committee; but then they send to him an account of the motion, infurming him in the letter—that “letters convey but very imperfectly, and with no great degree of safety, what we might wish to inform each other of. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 438 Now what do you think it is that they do not inform him of in this letter
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 439 They do Not inform him in this letter, because letters will not convey every thing safely—that the convention was tu meet in case of invasion— that was a secret, which durst not be trusted to correspondence by letter, and because it existed in that motion which wasmade, every other part of it being communicated even in a letter, they consider it of such a nature, that they determine not to insert it even in their own minutes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 440 This Secret Committee having been apinted in the Scotch Convention, the fact ing communicated to the London Corresponding Society by their delegates, you willlikewise find that Mr. Sinclair, the delegate from the Constitutional Society to the Society at Edinburgh, was not behindhand in the communication of it: he communicates the proceedings, and desires that a secret committee may be appointed in that society. It was not long after this, that the wisely exerted power of the magistracy of that country dispersed that convention. The dispersion of that convention, which, from what I have before stated to you, was conceived to bea body that must then do its work, or its work never would be done, suggested to the societies of this country the necessity of undering the same business, of undertaking it at the same hazard, knowing that the project must either then be accomplished, or that it never could thereafter be attempted—for that no government could permit such a convention as this to meet, when its nature was teally understood, without taking some means to protect itself against the consequences of the existence of such a convention. Gentlemen, you will therefore find, that, after they had been dispersed, and aftcr, in consequence of that dispersion, some of them had been punished in Scotland, by sentences which were pronounced upon offences, not stated in the records of that court in so aggravated a way against them as they might, in my humble opinion, have been stated, that it became ni that some step should be taken immediately to prevent the mischief ich was meditated; for you will find, in the evidence, propositions in these societies about a rescue, which failed; but Pe: will find in their correspondence from Scotland, and their correspondence from those ships in which the members of the Scotch Convention were before they sailed in execution of their sentences, not only the strongest invitations to do some strong acts in this country, to both societies, but, on the other hand, the strongest and most unequivocal declarations pee societies, that these strong acts must ne. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 441 Gentlemen, you will find that before they left Scotland, upon the 11th of December, 1793, there is a letter from Mr. Margarot to Mr. Hardy to this effect—“ We received your letter and remittance yesterday, and shall be glad to receive another such without delay. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 442 “ The convention you will see has declared Nself permanent; they are to sit jn some other part of the country, which is not yet 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 443 Gentlemen, Mr. Sinclair, the delegate of the Constitutional Society, came to London. Ihave before observed to you, from a letter of Gerrald and Margarot, that there were some things that could not safely be conveyed by letter. Margarot writes a letter from Edinburgh to the ‘prisoner, in which he says —“ My colleague, Gerrald, also proposes to leave place the latter end of this, or the beginning of the next week: he will expleia himself to you: Pray send him ‘money for this journey, &c. He is now gone to Perth on very urgent business. Since Sinclair's departure nothing new has occurred, except the formation of a society somewhere about the Grampian Hills’—this shows the spirit of fraternization—“ they have already made a subscription towards it: again we are interrupted, and likely tu lose the post, unless I dispatch this immediately. ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 444 Upon the 22d of December 1793, another letter is written to Mr. Hardy by the same gentleman, which probably led in some degree, to the transactions that I have to state as having passed in January 1794; for, after stating what had happened to himself ip Scotland, he says— Sheffield has on this occasion exhibited a most manly spirit’ — The Sheffield Society had at that time sent out some excessively strong resolutions, which I shall give you in evidence in. the course of this business—“ I am extremely mortified to find so great a difference between them and the London Corresponding Society ; itis not however too late. For God's make send forth some very strong resolutions, and above all, talk of impeachments, and of petitioning the king to remove from their offices those persons who have thus violated the laws of the realm. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 445 You will find from a letter of the 24th of December, that spp ales a delegate of the London Society, a delegate of Norwich, and a Mr. Brown, who was the delegate from Sheffield, had gone to attend a general meeting of the Society of the Friends of Freedom in'East Lothian, and then the expression isThe time is come that we must show ourselves worthy of liberty, or deservedly lose it. The opposition of our adversaries is demonstration of the propriety and efficacy of the means which we have employed to obtain it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 446 Upon the 27th of December 1793, a will find Mr. Margarot states that Mr. Gerrald was gone to Perth; that he himself had been in t Lothian ; that they had been well employed; that they must send out spirited resolutions; and you will find, that, upon the 11th of January 1794, Mr. Hardy writes a letter to Norwich relative to the proceedings I have now been stating, the Constitutional Society first, and the London Corresponding Society afterwards, peving in their public acts approved every thing that this convention had done. Mr. Hardy’s letter runs thus: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 447 I have just received a letter from citizen Margarot, at Edinburgh, with some of the Edinburgh Gazetteers, where you will see that citizen Skirving is found guilty, and sentenced for fourteen years transportation to Botany Bay. Margarot’s trial comes next; he meets it with great firmness and resolution. I have no time to make m comments on the proceedings, but I thi our opponents are cutting their. own throats 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 448 ‘| as fast as they can—Now is the time for us to do something worthy of men: the brave deSenders of liberty, south of the English channel, are performing wonders, driving their enemies before them like chaff before the whirlwind. Margarot tells me that he has not time to write to you just now, but he hopes to have time very soon, when his trial is over, and immured in a prison. The London Corres‘ponding Society is to have a general meeting, and an anniversary dinner on Monday the 20th instant, at the Globe tavern, Strand. Gentlemen, you will find that Mr. Margarot, this delegate, with whom Mr. Hardy is thus in correspondence, writes to the Norwich United Societies—“ This morning ten ships of war have left Spithead for the channel; and it is here reported, that the Brest fleet is out. Rumour, always magnifying things, says there are seventy sail of the French at sea; if so, there must be a number of transports among them, and a descent may probably be the consequence—for God's whe: my worthy friends, do not relax in the cause of freedom.—Now what connexion had a descent with the cause of freedom
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 449  ‘“ Continue as you have begun; conselidate your own societies—unite with others— rsevere, and make no doubt, but, sooner or later, your endeavours will be crowned with success. : Gentlemen, I come now to state to you 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 450 ‘the proceedings of the year 1794, as far as ithey depend upon written evidence; and it must be a satisfaction to the mind of every man who hears me, that, in the course of this business, whatever observations may arise upon the parol eyidence that will be 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 451 “given you, I think ‘you will find so strong a confirmation of all you are to hear in the written evidence that is to be laid before you, ‘that these observations cannot possibly mislead you from coming to the true conclusion upon the whole of the evidence, whatever that may be. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 452 Gentlemen,. the Constitutional Society, having sent their delegate to the Scotch Con‘vention, you will find that, ata meeting of “the 17th of January 1794, the following reso‘lutions were come to, to which I must desire your particular attention, more especially as there are some circumstances belonging to the composition of those resolutions, which appear to me to be worthy of attention. I have before told you that these resolutions “were usually drawn from minutes—the original minutes still exist, and perhaps they show that discretion, with which men are sometimes able to state, in different ways, precisely the same thing: I say, that these Tesolutions of the 17th of January 1794, were meant to excite the subjects of this country to resistance. co 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 453 “ Resolved, That law ceases to be an object of obedience, whenever it becomes an instrument of oppression. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 454 “ Resolved, That we recall to mind, with the infamous Jefferies, once lord chief justice of England, who, at the era of the glorious revolution, for the many iniquitous sentences which he had passed, was torn to pieces by a brave and injured people. This 1s applied to the judges of Scotland, who executed the law upon such facts as I have been stating —“ That those who imitate his example deserve his fate—this sort of intimation might have a tendency, I hope it had not, to put in any peril those who did, in the regular course, and in the due course, of their judicial duties, pass those sentences, to which these resolutions allude. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 455 “ That the Tweed, though it may divide countries, ought not, and does not, make a separation between those principles of com‘mon severity in which Englishmen and Scotchmen are equally interested; that injustice in Scotland is-injustice in England; and that the safety of Englishmen is endangered, whenever their brethren in Scotland, for a conduct ‘which entitles them to the approbation ofall wise, and the support of all brave men, are sentenced to Botany Bay, a punishment hitherto intlicted only on felons. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 456 hat we see with regret, but we see without fear, that the period is fast approacliing when the liberties of Britons—this was in January—“ must depend, not upon reason, to which they have long appealed, nor on their powers of expressing it, but on theirfirm and undaunted resolution to ‘oppose tyranny by the same means by which it is exercised. Now what is thetyranny? The exercise of the regular government of the country. What is the means by which it is exercised? The application of the force of the country in support of the government of the country. What is this resolution then? Why, that the means which the government takes in the regular exercise of its functions, ought now to be resisted— We see it with regret, but do not see it with any fear. That a breach of allegiance was contemplated you can have no doubt, for you will see in the original of this that it stood thusthat, “ as allegiance and protection are reciprocal, law ccuses to be an object of obedience, wherever it becomes an instrument of eppressian Cae that, as it stood originally, with the third resolution, and whatait? Why, it is—that the protection, which was due from Kim to whom allegiance is due, has not been afforded: therefore allegiance is no longer due. “ We see with regret, but we see without fear, that the period is fast approaching, when the liberties of Britons must depend, not upon reason, to which they have long appealed, nor on their powers of expresing it, but on-their firm ard undaunted resolution to oppose tyranny by the same means by which it is exercised. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 457 You will also find that it stood, “that lishmen feel the oppression of Scotehmen, which they are determined to resist at the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 458 ‘fhe deepest satisfaction, the merited fate ofhazard of their lives,"—You will find the lass resolution, in the minates, comparing the gebuine representatives of this country, in the House of Commons, with this convention in Scotland, which convention in Scotland had taken upon itself to resolve upon resistance to even a motion, in either House of Parliament of this country, in the execution of their duty, thus : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 459 hat we approve of the conduct of the British Convention, who, though assailed by force, have not been answered by arguments, and who, unlike the members of a certain assembly, have no interest distinct from the common body of the peuple—The words originally e008 who “ being the incorrupt representatives of many thousands, have spoken thege of truth and firmness. Can I make this court the instrument of conveying to the public, what I cenfess I do most anxiously wish to make it the instrument of conveying to the public, as far as it is fit, in the execution of the duty that I am now discharging, that they may understand what it is that men, when they are scattering these libels through the country, mean—“ this convention, assailed by force, have not been answered by arguments—How was it possible to answer those by arguments, who were comting to solemn and sacred resolutions, which they did not even dare to put upon the face of their own minutes? How were we to answer those by ment, who were working under ground till they had blown up the government, and then say, you cannot point out that we have been acting ill, because we will not tell you how we have been acting ? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 460 Upon the 16th, Mr. Margarot writes again, leaving them to pursue what sort of conduct they please. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 461 Then there is a letter of some importance of the 28th of January, which is written to the person who stands at the bar—“ We have justreceived notice from the sheriff to hold ourselves nenly We depart at an hour's warning: we night; we imagine to Newgate; Look out for us. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 462 Gentlemen, you will likewise find a letter from Mr. Margarot to Mr. Hardy, of great consequence, as it explains many of the passages im the evidence between the 20th of January 1704, and the time that those persons were apprehended. Margarot writes from Edinburgh in this manner : “ armed associations are, I ewe, now set on foot by the rich; wherefore should not the poor do the same? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 463 “ Are you to wait patiently till twenty thousand Hessians and Hanoverians come to cut your throats? And will you stretch forth your necks like lambs to the butcher’s knife, and, like lambs, content yourselves with bleating? Pray let me hear from you soon. Remember me to Moffat, Muir, and Palmer, and all suffering brethren. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 464 Gentlemen, upon the 20th of January 1794, there was a meeting at the Globe tavern; that meeting, which, you will permit me to observe, Hardy mentioned in his letter of the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 465 11th of January 1794, which I before have spoken of, when he said the London Corresponding Society were to have a general meeting, and an anniversary dinner. Gentlemen, the proceedings of that day will des serve your very particular attention. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 466 “ Ata general meeting of the London Cor. responding Society, held at the Globe tavern, Strand, on Monday the 20th day of January 1794, citizen John Martin in the chair,— when I state this to you, I ought to say that I shall prove the prisoner to have been present, or to have been connected with all the transactions that I have been stating—“ the following address to the people of Great Britain and Ireland, was read and agreed to : citizens, We find the nation involved in a war, by which, in the course of one campaign, immense numbers of our countrymen have been slaughtered ; a vast expense has been incurred; our trade, commerce, and manufactories are almost destroyed ; and many of our ma nufacturers and artists are ruined, and their families starving. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 467 o add to our affliction, we have reason to expect that other taxes will soon be adied to the intolerable load of imposts and impositions, with which we are already overwhelm ed, for the purpose of defraying the expenses which have been incurred in a fruitless cresade, to re-establish the odious despotism of France. Co 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 468 “ When we contemplate the principles of this war, we confess ourselves to be unable to approve of it as a measure either of justice or discretion; and, if we are to form our calcu lation of the result, from what has already passed, we can only look forward to defeat, and the eternal disgrace of the British name. While we are thus engaged in an expen sive and ruinous foreign war, our state at home is not less deplorable. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 469  We are every day told by those persone who are interested in aap ns the corruption list, and an innumerable host of sinecure placemen, that the constitution of England is the perfection of human wisdom; that our laws (we should rather say their laws) are the perfection of justice; and that their administration of those laws is so impartial and so Teady, a3 to afford an equal remedy both to the rich and to the poor, by means of which we are said to be placed in a state of absolute freedom. The paper then goes on and reasons upon the state of the law in this country, under an exposition of Magna Charta, which gives as nearly the true meaning of it as man would give, who had never seen it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 470 “Jf we look to Ireland, we find that aeknowledged privilege of the people to mect for the support and protection of their rights and liberties, is attempted by terror to be taken away, by a late mfamous act of parliament
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 471 That was an act to prevent convention by delegates with dangerous objects. Whilst titles of honour—no—but of dishopour, are lavished, and new sources of cosruption opened to gratify the greedy prostitution of those who ns the instruments of this oppression. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 472 “In Scotland, the wicked hand of power has been impudently exerted without even the wretched formality of an act of parliament
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 473 A piece of parchment justice they call an act, in the convention of Scotland. — “ istrates have forcibly intruded into the eaceful and lawful meetings of freemen, and y force (not only without law, but against Jaw) have, under colour of magisterial office, interrupted their deliberations, and prevented their association. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 474 “ The wisdonr and good conduct of the British Convention in Edinburgh has been such, as to defy their bitterest enemies to name the law which they bave broken; notwithstanding which, their papers have been seized and made use of as evidence against them, and many virtuous and meritorious individuals have been, as cruelly as unjustly, for their virtuous actions, disgraced and destroyed by infamous and illegal sentences of transportation; and these unjust and wicked judgments have been-executed with a rancour -and malignity never before known in this land; our respectable and beloved fellow Citizens have been cast fettered into dungeons, amongst felons in the hulks, to which they were not sentenced. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 475 “Citizens, we all approve the sentiments, ‘and are daily repeating the words for which these our respectable and valuable brethren are thus, unjustly and inhumanly, suffering ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 476 we do associate—mark the expression—“ in order to obtain a fair, free, and full representation of the people in a house of real national representatives
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 477 Now, did the convention st Edinburgh then associate for the purpose to obtain a fair, free, and full representation of the people in a house of real national representatives? if they did, they associated to form that house of real representatives upon this principle, that they were, as Mr. Skirving calls them, the people in Scotland, that they were to athliate, and to associate themselves 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 478 ‘with societies in England; and that, in that state of affiliation and association, holding a convention, as they call it, of the people, from delegates of these societies, and not el the people—to do what 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 479 why, to meet as an assembly, which assembly was to control the operations of periments of that parliament, which must be the representatives of the Commons of the nation ; an expression, which by the way, they never used, adopting ene’ rally terms of a different import, “ fNational Representatives. ‘Are we also willing to be treated as felons for claiming this our inherent right? which we are determined never to forego but with our lives, and which none but thieves and -traitors—that is, persons acting in the regudar execution of the functions of magistracy— ‘can wish to withhold from us? consider, it sone and the same corrupt aud corrupting influence, which at this time domineers in Treland, Scotland, and England: can you believe that those, who send virtuous Irishmen and Scotchmen, fettered with feluns to Botany Bay, do not meditate, and will not attempt te seize the first moment, to send us after them; or if we had not just cause to apprehend the same inbuman treatment, if, instead of the most imminent danger, we were in perfect safety from it, should we not isdain to enjoy any liberty or privilege whatever in which our honest Irish and Scotch brethren did not equally and as fully participate with us? Their cause then, and ours, is the same, and it is both our duty and our interest to stand or fall together. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 480 Gentlemen, recollect the expressions that Tread to yeu from Skirving’s letter: “ will you wait till barracks are erected in every village, and till subsidized Hessians and Hanoverians are upon us? You will now see from the proceedings I am stating to you, that the time was come, that they were not only virtuous but courageous enough to do an act, which in 1792 and 1793, though they were virtuous enough to do, they were not cow rageous enough to do. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 481 “ You may ask. perhaps, by what means shall we seek redress? We answer, that men in a state of civilized society, are bound to seek redress of the grievances from the laws, as long as any redress can be obtained by the laws; but our common master, whom we serve (whose law is a law of liberty, and whose service is perfect freedom), has taught us not to expect to gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles: we must have redress Jrom our own laws. —Were they to be a convention of the people, then, without making laws? They approve the whole conduct of the British Convention, that would not let others make laws, and yet were they not to make laws? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 482 “ We must have redress from our own laws, and not from other laws; the laws of Great Britain are thus described,—“ the laws of our plunderers, enemies, and oppressors : indeed, if the legislature of their country were their plunderers, enemies, and oppressors, in their Notions, it would be very difficult to suppose, that they were to have redress from the laws of that legislature; but then it follo of course, that they meant to have reiress Ronn laws made by some other body, that had authority to make laws: and what that other bodyis, but the Convention which they determine upon must be left for those to say, who can find it out. They go on then to say, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 483 ‘“ There is no redress for a nation circumstanced as we are, but in a fair, free, and ful representation of the people
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 484 Now, here again I ask, what is that fair, full, and free representation of the people, not mentioned to be in parliament? but if it was, it would be precisely the same phrase as occurred at the time of the Common-wealth. But they take upon them toapprove of the BritishConveation, and to unite the two nations of England and Scotland, to be a British Convention formed by delegates from the different societies in this ager kot professing to act as a convention of the people; I say, that it is ¢hat species of convention, which, in their opinion «vas a anes Sree, and full representation of the peopee, in which, and which alone, they hoped for that redress, which they could not bope for from the parliament of Great Britain, those, who were their plunderers, their enemies, and oppressors. Could it be possible for them to suppose, that they could make parliament the willing or unwilling organ of bringing about this representation of the people to subsist by annual suffrage and universal rePresentation? Could it have entered into their imagination that those whom -they -call their plunderers, enemies, and oppressors, would ever become the voluntary or involuntary instrument of doing that which was the object of all these societies, from March 1791, till they were checked in the execution of their purposes? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 485 Then follows a resolution that will require likewise your very particular attention : “ Resolved, That during the ensuing session of parliament the general committee of this society do meet daily, for the purpose of watching the proceedings of the parliament and of the administration of the government of this country. This was to be published: they do not therefore venture to insert totidem verbis that resolution, which I have stated to you was so solemnly made, and so sacredly sworn to in the Scotch Convention, but they resolve “ that upon the first introduction of any bill or motion inimical to the liberties of the peole, such as for landing foreign troops in Great ritain or Ireland, for suspending the Habeas Corpus act, for proclaiming martial law, or for preventing the people from meeting in societies for constitutional information — What the meaning of the term constitutional is we can judge by this time—that uponany express motion of this nature, “or any other innovation o «a similar nature ; that on any of these emergencies the general committee shall issue summonses to the delegates of each division, and also to the secretaries of the different societies affiliated and corresponding with-this society, forthwith to calla eae caecalin of the people, to be held at such place, and in such a manner, as shall be specified in the sammons, for the purpose of taking such measures into their consideration. They omit the case of invasion in this publication. But what is this, supposing nothing had passed in Scotland of what I have stated to you? What! Is the legislature, is the rule and government in this great country reduced to this state, that it shall ind no protection in the administration of the law of the country against ns, associating and affiliating themselves x the purposes which they declare here? Is no motion to be made in parliament for amy purpose, which these societies choose to comprehend under the terms “ any other innevation, without explaining what it means
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 486 but what? but that bodies of men are to come together, claiming to themselves the civil and political authority, which exists im the natural and physical qualities of the people, and then to contend that they have gota convention of the people? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 487 Now, do they canvene the-people? In faet, it will be said, nothing like it. t they cali themselves a convention of the people in the very terms that they use. the summonses are to go to the delegates of each meeting, and also the secretaries of the different societies corresponding with this society, and no where else. For what purpose? ‘To call a general convention of the people! Then, what w the meaning of all that, taking it with its context? It is thise from your laws—the laws of you, our plunderers, enemies, and oppressors—we can expect no relief: we do not mean to come to you fur any: but we will watch you, and if you dare to propose an innovation of any sort, we shall call a fain, Sree, and full representation of the people. Composed pray how? By delegates from our societies, to seek, as a general convention of the People, redress from our own laws. It appears to me that the reasoning upon this paper 1s so whole and intire, that it is out of power of human ingenuity to touch it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 488 Then they resolve, “ That a hundred thousand copies of the Address to the people of Great Britain and Ireland shall be printed. Then they follow this up with the publication of a great many toasts ; and really, when one mentions such a thing as toasts in the trial of a greatnational cause, such as this undoubtedly is, one is afraid of its sinking into insignificance ; and yet this is a great feature in this cause. You will find that previously to one ofthe most seditious meetings which was ever held in this country, it was thought of importance enough that they should meet once, twice, or thrice, in committees, in arder to frame toasts, which were best calculated to inflame their minds, and to urge those forward who were already engaged in these projects, “ The Rights of Man: “ The British Convention ;—“ Success to the arms of freedom, against whomsoever directed. This is during the war—against whom were the armsof freedom directed, in the opinion of these persons? You remember they said that “ the elector of Hanover may join his troops to traitors and robbers; but the king of Great Britain will do well to remember that this country is not. Hanover: should he forget the distinction, we will not. They corresponded with the French in October; and in November 1792, they state to you, that the principles of their resolutions are those upon which they meant to act—that Great Britain was now engaged in a war—which they mmned—in which the arms of freedom, as ghey said, had never been engaged on the part of Great Britain. Then the meaning of the toast is obvieus, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 489 Another toast was—“ The virtuous and spirited citizens now in confinement for matters of opinion. Now, these matters of opinion are acts all done in the long tissue and detail of aconspiracy to subvert the monarchical government of this country, under its present legal provisions and limitations. The name of Mr. Frost being mentioned— I'mean him no disrespect in saying this—but it is tothe purpose of this business to take Notice of it—that gentleman was prosecuted in this country for this doctrine—“ No king, none in England, I am for liberty and equality every where. What was the consequence of that? The judgment of the law of England upon him was, that he was guilty of an offence: he was punished: he has suffered that punishment, and made an atonement to the Jaw: but these gentlemen, who sent Mr. Frost with Mr. Barlow, to state such doctrine to France, and br:ng such doctrine baek from France, you will find that they havea formal resolution that they will sustain this Mr. Frost in all his persecutions and prosecutions. Docs that mean nothing? If Mr. Frost is perseeuted for holding doctrines in the country, which were to put the king out of the system, is it no evidence of intention with respect to those who engaged in such projects jas I have mentioned, that they do come to a resolution, in which they declare that the law, questioning the propriety of declarations of that kind amounts toa persecution, and that he ought to be sustained against it? Gentlemen, you will bear from witnesses, who were present, what the proceedings on the 20th of January, and the general com’ plexion and nature of them were. Mr. Martin being in the chair, and Mr. Hardy being present, who wasa member of both these societies, an attending member in both of them, I will give you Martin’s account of the proceeding on the 22d of January 1794, in a letter in bis own hand-writing, sent to MauTice Margarot, at Edinburgh, who bad advised you will recollect, the London Corresponding Society to come to sume strong resolutions— who had urged that now is the time, that two months in Scotland would do the business, provided they did their duty in England. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 490 “ My dear sir, I dare say you think I have forgot you from my not having written to You, but you know my sentiments so well that it ‘was unnecessary for me, and would probably have been improper to say much on the subject of your mission’—then he states something about private business. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 491 “We had a meeting on Monday, I was in the chair—the newspaper gives our numbers at 500, but we were nearer 1,500: every thing was well conducted, that is to say regularly, and the proceedings were tolerably bold. Mr. Hardy, dare say, has sent you a copy of the address and resolution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 492 “ Your conduct receives universal approbation; and though I at one time dreaded the who opposed the subscription at first, are now putting their hands to the very bottom of their pockets, and swear by God you shall be supported with the last guinea—we must have another general meeting in a chapel, or some large place, and declare the purpose of a subscription, and I think we shall get plenty of the needful:for that and other purposes. Have you read my letter to ? do you incline to try the writ of error? what do the Scotch lawyers think of it, and what do you think of the legal knowledge of my countrymen? I firmly believe that the law is the only science, of which they know nothing. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 493 he king went yesterday to meet Ais parliament’—so now we have got no parliament of ours, the people of this country —“ they sat till six o’clock this morning: the papers are not out, but I am told only twelve members were for peace: I am glad the minister has so great a majority within doors for the war, and that the people have a greater majority without doors against the war: the swinish rogues had the impudence to write ‘ No war’ on all the doors and corners of the Houses of Lords and Commons, and they had even the audacity to groan and hiss, while his most sacred majesty was passing to and from the House —nay told, a woman, moved and seduced by the instigation of the devil, and traitorously intending, &c. did in St. James's Park take off her patten, and threw it with all her force at his majesty, whereby the glass of the state coach was broken, and his majesty putin fear: God save the king, for if, &c
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 494  as Gerrald says—there he leaves it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 495 “ The society is increasing rapidly, both in spirit and in numbers, and the richnow begin to come among us, and to sit down with pleasure among the honest men with the leathern aprons. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 496 I could write to you strange things, but I know not but this may be read by somebody before it comes to your hands. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 497 Gentlemen, after this had passed, you will find that that letter was written by the Corresponding Society to the Society tor Constie tutional Informatiton (which I first mentioned to you) upon the 27th of March 1794, and now with your leave, I will read a part of .it to you again. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 498 “ I am directed by the London Correspond ing Socicty to transmit the following resolutions to the society for Constitutional Information. I should tell you first, in the order of time, that the society for Constitutional Information distinctly adopt that paper of the London Corresponding Society of the 20th of January 1794, as their own, and order it to be entered upon their books; they approve of the manly sentiments of it, and they fully take it to themselves, to all intents and purposes, as if it had been a conjunct meeting of them both. Then, the London Corresponding Society having held this- language respecting the convention, and upon the 24th of J. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 499 want of money, yet that is now over: those, the Constitutional Society having adopted the project of a convention stated in the address of the London Corresponding Society of the 20th, and the nature of that convention being acopvention from the atftiliated societies, to take upon themselves the character of a conpention of the people, it would be surprising indeed ifthe convention, which they speak of on the 27th of March, should be a convention of a different nature from that which they had both agreed to on the 20th and 24th of January—and with that observation I come again to this letter of the 27th of March. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 500 am directed by the London Corresponding Society to transmit the following resolutione tu the Society for Constitutional Information, and to request the sentiments of that society respecting the important measures which the present juncture of affairs seems to require. ‘The London Corresponding Society eonceives that the moment is arrived throughout the years 1791, 1792, and 1793, they thought it was not arrived—“ when a full and explicitdeclaration is necessary from all the friends of treedom—whether the late illegal and unheard-of prosecutions and sentences shall determine us to abandon our cause, or shall excite us to pursue a radical reform, with an ardour proportioned to the magnitude of the object, and with a zeal as distinguished on our parts, as the treachery of others in the same glorivus cause is notorious. The society for Constitutional Information is therefore required to determine whether or no they will be ready, when called upon, to act in conjunction with this and other societies, to obtain a tair representation of the people, whether they concur with us in seeing the necessity of a speedy convention for the purpose of obtaining, in a constitutional and legal method, a redress of those grievances under which we at present labour. Now, in the first place, with respect to the words “constitutional and legal method, ‘these persons have not much to claim upon the score of the effect and force of the words constitutional and legal method, which appear, through all their transactions of the years 1792 and 1793, and more particularly through the transactions of 1793, as they appy to the British Convention, in Scotland, to thought consistent with the existence of a eonvention of such a character as that had; and, if it was their purpose to have a convention of the people, by summonses to affiliated societies, that convention to take upon itself the power of the people, it is in vain that they talk of legal and constitutional methods : it is in vain, if the thing they mean to do, and the manner of doing it, is not legal or constitutional —Upon this letter, I apprehend, after what has passed, there can be no doubt what is meant bya convention: but it is not left there: for in the third resolution they state, that “there ought to be immediately 4 convention of the people by delegates—mark the words—“ deputed for that purpose from the aifferent societies of the friends of freedom, assembled in the various parts of this nation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 501 Then here is a convention of the same character, of the same name, and the same constitution, as that mentioned in the resolution of the 20th of January 1794. Now, to whom is this proposed? It is proposed to that Constitutional Society, which had adopted the address of the 20th of January 1794, and which had also said, by approving that address, that they were of opinion that redress was not to be obtained by the laws of England, but that they were to have redress against their oppressors, plunderers, and enemies, by their own laws—by that sort of representation of the people, which is formed by aconvention of the people, summoned from those associated societies. Then what follows upon it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 502  though the thing is couched in phrases that are a littleambiguous, yet no human being, judging honestly, can doubt the meaning of it; itis, that there shall be this convention, to act asa convention of the people, with the power of the people, having or claiming all eivil and political authority. The prisoner is sufficiently involved oe if sucha convention never had been thought of; but then the two societies form a committee of correspondence and co-operation for the purpose of bringing together that convention, which they had gail was the only mean by which Britons could enjoy their liberties, or protect themselves against the legitimate government of the country, including 1n it their plunderers, enemies, and oppressors. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 503 Gentlemen, when I lay this evidence before you, if I stopped here, I should be glad to learn why this is not a step taken for the execution of such a purpose as I have before stated—a step taken for constituting a body, or a step taken towards devising the means of constituting a body which was, lke the convention mentioned in the speech of Barrere, to supersede the legislature, to depose the king, to suffer him to have no existence, but what their good will and pleasure would allow him, against the will, as the language of the indictment states it, and im defiance of the authority of the parliament—to depose the king—for, if these people have the sovereign power, and they must have the sovereign power upon their own principles—the king of England cannot have it in the manner in which it is vested in him now. He was bound to resist such a projectas this: he owed it to every good subject in his country to resist it— he was sworn to do it by the solemn obligation of his coronation oath—you cannot therefore contemplate a case of his acting otherwise—the king being bound to resistance for the security of the subject, and fur the sake of observing his oath, for the sake of continuing to reign according to the terms of that oath, according to the statutes acreed upon in parliament assembled, and the laws and customs of the same. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 504 But, gentlemen, I do not stop here: you will also that there was a mecting at 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 505 Chalk Farm, the particulars of which I will Not state farther than to say, that, when they arg read, you will see that that meeting at Chalk Farm was a step taken in the farther prosecution of the functions of that committee of co-operation—that it was a measure taken for the express purpose of trying the temper of the people, of seeing what they could do by numbers. That meeting was held in April 1794, and it is very remarkable that it appears that there were meetings in other parts of this kingdom ; more particularly it appears from a letter, found in the possession of this prisoner, baa a there was a meeting in the open air at Chalk Farm, so there were meetings elsewhere —it required vigilance—it required the interposition of some strong hand, by parliament or otherwise, to preserve you in the situation in which you now are: if it be the will of these persons that you shall not remain in it, it is at least the duty of those, who are to watch over the country as long as it can exist, that it shall not be destroyed by any fault of theirs: but you will find there were meetings in the open air at Leeds, Wakefield, Huddersfield, Bradford, Birstal, and at various other laces. This project of a convention had en communicated to many parts of the country, and too many of them had assented to it; not only assented to it, but it will be proved, that the prisoner sent a circular letter to the remotest parts of this kingdom (which I willnow read), for the purpose of assembling this convention, for the perpore of carrying into effect the project of this British Convention, the body of which had been dissipated, but which was still carrying on its purposes b measures precisely the same as those whic! had exist in this part of the island. You will find that the prisoner writes this circular letter to all those societies; and the addressing this circular letter to all the societies, shows that the convention that was to be called was not to be a convention of the people at large, but a convention of delegates summoned from those societies, to usurp the character of “ a convention of the people. — “ The critical moment is arrived—mark the difference of language; in 1793 the time is not yet come, men are not virtuous nor courageous enough ; in 1792 they expected nothing from parliament; in 1793, they expected every thing from the societies in due time; and now they assert that the due time is come, that the Sulness of time is come—“ the critical moment “6 arrived, and Britons must either assert with zeal and firmness their claims to liberty, ‘or yield without resistance to the chains that ministerial usurpation is forging for them. Will you co-operate with us in the only peaceable measure—a very peaceable measure a convention of this sort!—“ that now presents itself with any prospect of success? We need not intimate to you, that, notwithstanding the unparalleled audacity of a corrupt and overbearing faction—now this corrupt and overbearing faction is the King, Lords, and Gommons of Great Britain—“ which at present earnest on the rights and liberties of the people; our peeing cannot in England be interrupted without the previous adoption of a convention bill. A convention bill !—this shows the reason for their resolutions in Scotland about permanent sittings, and the meeting of another British Convention, and for their language, which they held upon the. 20th of January 1794; “a measure it is our duty to anticipate’—mark these words—“ our duty to anticipate, that the ties of union may be more firmly drawn, and the sentiments and views of the different societies throughout the nation be com "—What was their object in this circular letter? If, when the British Convention in Edinburgh sat, there had been a motion for a convention bill in the parliament of Great Britain, why, their object was then, we perceive, that of being ready at an hour’s warning; communicating in ali parts of the kingdom to their delegates that solemn resolution, which had been made im the British Convention upon the 6th of November; they were instantly, before the project of such a bill could in parliament ripen out of notice of a motion into a bill once read, to be assembled in Edinburgh to prevent any such bill passing; they solemnl vowed to each other, hand in hand, and stan ing up, to give the greater solemnity to the declaration, “ that the moment such a bill as that was introduced into parliament, they would resist it at the hazard of their lives. Then what did they mean in this circular letter ? they meant that, while as yet the bare expectation of a convention bill might exist, while, as yet, no notice of such a motion was given or heard of in parliament—that it was their duty to anticipate what parliament might possibly think of. How to anticipate it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 506 to anticipate it by means of a convention assuming the character of a British Convention of the people, but delegated from these societies, to sit not at Edinburgh, but to sit at a place, as yu will find, which they durst not name, and for the purpose of conducting this project with more security, as you find by this letter, to sit at a place that was to be kept secret, in order that the purpose might not be disa pointed. ‘“ A measure, they proceed, seis ing of a convention bill, “it is our duty to anticipate, that the ties of union may be more rmly drawn, and the sentiments and views of the different societies throughout the nation be compared, while it is yet in our power, so as to guide and direct the future operations of the friends of freedom. Rouse then to one exertion more, and let us show our consciousness of this important truth; if we are to be beaten down with threats, prosecutions, and illegal sentences, we are unworthy, we are incapable of liberty; we must, r, be exe peditious ; Hessians and Austrians—here is the idea that came from Scotland again— “are already amoung us, and if we tamely submit, a cloud of these armed berbariens Joy shortly be poured in upon us. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 507 The loprothaetion of sick men e this eountry for the humane purpose of giving them that air, which they could not obtain while on board a ship, is made the pretext of this letter for stating that “Hessians and Austrians are already among us, and, if we tamely submit, a cloud of these armed barbarians may be pace inupon us. Let us form then another British Convention. What was that convention? they expressly state it to be convention of the people, and a convention, which is to assume controlling powers over the legislature. “‘ We have a central situation io our view, which we believe would be most convenient for the whole island, but which we forbear to mention (entreating your confidence in this particular) till we have the answer of—whom 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 508 “ of the societies, with which we are in correspondence. What, is that a convention of the people? or of the societies assuming the character of a convention of the people? “Let us have your answer then—Now, give me leave to observe how nearly this project was to being carried into effect—“ Let us have your answer then by the 20th at farthest, earlier, if possible, whether hn approve of the measure, and how many de bed you can send, with the number also, if possible, of your societies. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 509 Gentlemen, this will be proved to you to have travelled as far as Strathaven, to have been received there, and delegates to have been appointed in consequence of the solicitation ; and then, as in the British Convention, in the month of November 1793, this great project of calling together a body, which was to put an end finally to the existence of parliament, was to be conducted by a secret committee ; because its operations, its assembling, and the means which were to be taken for it, could not be committed to numbers, a secret committee was then appointed. This letter ends—“ for the management of this business we have sppomnied a secret committee: you will judge how far it is necessary for you to do thesame. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 510 Gentlemen, the next proceedings were at Chaik Farm. In these proceedings, it appears, they had stated to the Society called “ the Friends of the People, this measure of a convention ; that measure the Friends of the People refused to agree in. You will find that, refusing to agree in that measure, at the meeting at Chalk Farm, when it was stated that the Society of the Friends of the People would not agree in it—indeed, agree in it they could not—you will find what was the reception, which the communication of that information met with—an universal from a body of men, amounting, I believe, to a couple of thousand there assembled. entlemen, this committee of correspondence and co-operation, you will find, met; you will find that there is in the hand-writing of the prisoner, in avery short note, an account of what was done when they met; that one of the first steps towards the accomplishment of their purposes, was a communication of the correspondences of the country societies to those who were to be the delegates of the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 511 Constitutional Society; but the meeting was’ broke up by the apprehension of the prisoner and others, which has led, as I before stated, to this prosccution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 512 Gentlemen, I have before told you that I conceived it was competent for me, as indeed 1 apprehend without question it is, after proving the conspiracy, to show the conduct of the persons, who were parties in that conspiracy, in furtherance of the conspiracy, when it is proved. You will find that one of the persons who attended the meeting of the 20th of January 1794, and who was a very active member of the London Corresponding Society, and likewise one of the committee of correspondence and co-operation, which J have alluded to as the final act of this business, gives himself this account of the transactions of the 20th of January 1794, and of other circumstances: this is Mr. Thelwall. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 513 “ It is with infinite satisfaction that at last I received a letter from you; it was brought this morning by citizen Lee, and has been delayed, I understand, this fortnight at Rotherhithe by some accident. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 514  am too well acquainted with mankind to be surprised, too much of a philosopher to be angry at the abuse and misrepresentation of mistaken men; but I shall endeavour, as I wish to preserve the good opinion of a man whom I remember with esteem, to send you such printed documents as will prove to you that, instead of having deserted the cause of liberty, I have redoubled my zeal, and thas there is not at this time in England a man that goes bolder lengths, and exposes himself to more danger, in the cause of liberty, tham myself. I have been for four or five months past almost the sole labourer upon whom the fatigue, the danger, and the exertions of the London Corresponding Societies, the only avowed Sans Culottes in the metropolis, have rested; and have been otherwise so active in the cause, as scarcely to have passed a week without threats and conspiracies from the government and its purblind adherents. Ever since the famous, or infamous, call it which you will, proclamation of November, 1792, I have been frequenting all public Meetings where any thing could be done or expected, have been urging and stimulatin high and lew, and endeavouring to rally an encourage the friends of freedom. I have been constantly sacrificing interest and security, offending every personal advantageous connexion, till ministerialists, oppositionists, and moderees, hate me with equal cordiality, and, if I may judge by their conduct, fear me as much as they hate.. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 515 “ For these four months, I have been giving political lectures and gr and appropriating the whole receipts, till the last fortnight, to the support of our delegates to the British “ Convention ; for the history of which I must refer you to citizen Talbot, whom I have not seen tat whom I hope to see before he leaves England. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 516 e then gives an account of the meetings T have been stating to you, and of his lectures: then he says, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 517 “ Adieu. I will collect together what political papers ‘I can, to send to you when I can find leisure. Do write to me; let me know something aboat the state of politics and society in America. I fear you are somewhat short of the true Sans Culutte liberty ; that you have too much veneration for property, too much religion, and too much law. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 518  fear you are somewhat short of the true Sans Culotte liberty. Now, that is, that you have too much veneration for property, too meh religion, and too much law. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 519 Gentlemen, having now gone through the written evidence, I am to state to you some other circumstances. I have not indeed stated all the written evidence, because you will have written evidence laid before you of stimulations, under singular pretexts, to these societies, to arm themselves. You will find, that parliament, where they meant hereafter to suffer no debate, about the Hessians and Hanoverians, they circulated among them papers, and it will be brought home to those with respect to whom it is stated, to this effect — The ins tell us we are in danger of insvasion from the French ; the outs tell us that we are in danger from the Hessians and Hanoverians: ineither case, we should arm ourselves. Get arms, and leam how to use shem. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 520 You will likewise find, upon this part of the ease, that, after the dispersion of the Bri‘ish Convention in Edinburgh, after it was teen that the law of this country was strong enough to beat down .a conspiracy of that kind, acting by their mere naked numbers, that it became then, in their opinion, necessary to the accomplishment of their purpose, to act with arms. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 521 Now, gentlemen, where a general conspiracy of this sort, among affiliated societies, existed in Scotland, Sheffield, Norwich, Manchester, smd various parts of the king‘dom, all aiming at the same end, all acting upon the same principle, all involved in the same project of having a convention from the different parts of the united kingdoms, it is natural that they should think of arms: but, if the eonspiracy did not exist, it would seem a very odd thing that it should happen in fact, that, in these different rts of the kin; ‘field, and in London, we should find persons preparing arms of a sort, and of a denomination, which of late years we have not heard of in this country, except as existing in France, and except as stated in a letter from France, which I have read to you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 522 But, gentlemen, Bo will find, from the evidence I have to offer, and indeed it is not lom, in Scotland, in Shef. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 523 snprisips that you should so find—after I shall tell you, that in the pocket of one of the parties in this conspiracy, and distributed also in divisions in the London Corresponding Society, were papers, importing that upon the 1st of April, 1794, was to be periirrmesh, The Guillotine, or George’s Head inBasket ; papers in which the sacred person of the king 1s so spoken of, and in which all orders of men, under ludicrous representations of them to their country, were doomed te lamp-irons, and to suspension ; after I shall tell you, that I am instructed that Mr. Thelwall could, when retiring from Chalk-farm, take a pot of peer in his hand, with a knife take off the ead, and say, “ Thus I would serve all kings ; if you should find such language used, I am persuaded you widl not be surprised to find pikes in the hands of these men and their associates—to find muskets in the hands of these men and their associates. Do not, gentlemen, let us be misled by the great doctrine of the Bill of High that every man has a right to arms for his own protection— he has without question a right to convenient arms for his own defence; but the point before a jury will be, for what purpose had he the arms? If he attempts to say that he had them for his own defence—if had he them in fact for a worse purpose, the attempt to colour the tact makes the fact more criminal. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 524 Gentlemen of the jury, you will find that Mr. Yorke, in the month of November 1793, will be proved to have been at one of the divisions of the London Corresponding Society, stating, that he was going among the sons of liberty into Belgium, to bring into this coun try the true friends of liberty. You will find that he was a member of the Landon Cortespending Society, and constituted a delegate of the Constitutional Soeiety to Scotland ; that he has been propagating at Sheffield the same doctrine, as his brother associates were propagating in London: that he was there directing the form in which pikes should be made, to persons who were to make such instruments; that the persons at Sheffield enter into a correspondence with the prisoner at the bar; that they inform him that these pikes are made; that he delivers the direction to persons of the Corresponding Society, in order that they may furnish themselves with these instruments ; and that they were to be furnished from Sheffield to a place here, I think, the Parrot, ix Green Arbour alley, or some other place in this town; and that, if the apprehension of these persons here, and at Shetheld, had not put an ead to the farther execution of the project, there would have been a large apron of these pikes into this part of the kingdom. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 525 Gentlemen, you will find that this idea of arms was carried farther; you will find that, for the use of this society, a plate with figures, showing the manner of learning the military exercise, was engraved by a Mr. Worship, a member of this society. You will find that there was a military society in Lambeth, and another in Turnstile, Holborn; they were small in their beginnings, I admit; but these things must be so in their beginnings; and you will find, that the prisoner at the bar ve'to a witness of the name of Edwards, a jirection of whom to obtain pikes at Sheffield. Mr. Williams; another witness, who will be called to you, who is a gun-engraver in the Tower, made muskets for the use of these societies in Lambeth, and in Turnstile, with an express protest that he should not be employed, unless he himself became a member of the societies. You will find accordingly that he did become a member of them. You will find that they drilled at particular places. Gentlemen, I give you this outline of this part of the evidence, because I do not wish to enter more into the particulars, than to give you a general impression of the nature of the case which I have to lay before you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 526 You will likewise see, what is natural enough to happen, when you find in the book of the Society for Constitutional Information, that Mr. Horne Tooke could think of giving notice, that he would move “ that two books should be vpened, one of them (bound in black) in which should be entered all the enormities of those who deserve the censure ; and in the other, the merits of those who deserve the gratitude of the society. You will not be surprised, if you should find persons in these affliated societies, of lower descriptions, holding conversations about seizing the Most august persons in the nation; if you should hear of their holding conversations about the situation of persons in the House of Commons, and the means by which they could know their persons. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 527 Upon the whole, gentlemen of the jury, I shall now lay the testimony before you, submitting this written evidence to you, calling witnesses, above all exception, to a great part of the case; calling some witnesses, whom I now avow to you, you will find, were persona employed by government to watch over the proceeslings of these societies, and who there‘ore became informed, in consequence of such employment, of some of their transactions; and government would have been wanting to itself, and would have been wanting to a degree of criminality, which no mancan describe, if this country had at this moment been in the state in which it would have been, if these pikes had been brought into actual exertion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 528 At Sheffield, indeed, I am told they had got to the length of forming iron instruments, which were to disable horse, which they called night-cats, and which would immediately insert themselves into the hoofs of horses feet. I say, if, with these projects going on im the country, a secretary of stute, or any other person in the executive government, had hesitated a moment to procure information, these parties might have been able to put into execution the projects they were mepighng. and he would have been answerable for it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 529 Gentlemen, it-is the great province of a British jury, and God forbid these prisoners should not have the benefit of the reflection, that British juries are able to protect us all— are able to sift the characters of witnesses— to determine what credit is due to them—listening to men of good character without any impression against their evidence—listening to men, such as I have stated, with a strong impression against their evidence ; that impression, however, to be beat down by the concurrent unsuspicious testimony arising out of the rest of the case, if, upon the whole ou shall find the case to be made out as I ave stated it to you1. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 530 Gentlemen, I torgot to mention to you, that you will likewise find, about the time that this convention was talked of, that there was a new constitution framed for the Corresponding Society, in which they speak of a royalist as an enemy to the liberties of his country —of a democrate, as a friend to the liberties of his country; and you will find, that, ina constitution again revised, the whole was thrown into a scheme, and into a system, which was to add physical strength to the purposes of that convention, which was, I submit to you, to assume all civil and political authority. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 531 Tf you find all these things, and, if under the direction of that wisdom that presides here, with respect to which, gentlemen, let me say again, that the situation of this country is indeed reduced to a most miserable one, if the respect, which is due to the administration of the law, is suffered to be weakened in any manner, if the respect, which is due to the administration of the law, that administration, which perhaps is the best feature of the constitution under which we live, is destroyed, miserable indeed must be the situation of your country! If you’ find under that direction that the case, being proved in fact, is also made out in law, you will do that on behalf of the public which is due to yourselves, to the public, to your posterity, and theirs. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 532 But on the other hand, if, after hearing this case fully stated, and attempted to be fully proved, you should be of opinion that it is not proved, or you should be finally of opinion that the offence is not made out ac cording to the Aallowed interpretation of the statute of Edward 3rd; I say then, in the conclusion, I pein. from my heart, in the prayer which the law makes on behalf of the prisoner, God send the prisoner a safe deliverance !

BOWER 556 “ March 27, 1794, 
BOWER 557 “ Citizen; I am directed by the London Corresponding Society to transmit the following resolutions to the Society for Constitu‘tional Information, and to request the senti‘ments of that society respecting the important measures which the present juncture of affairs seems to require. The London Corresponding Society conceives that the moment is arrived when a full and explicit declaration is necessary from all the friends of freedom, ‘whether the late illegal and unheard-of prosecutions and sentences shall determine us to abandon our cause, or shall excite us to pursue a radical reform with an ardour proportioned to the magnitude of the object, and with a zeal as distinguished on our parts as the treachery of others in the same glorious cause is notorious; the Society for Constitutional Information is therefore required to determine whether or no they will be ready, when called upon,.to act in conjunction with this and other societies, to obtain a fair representation of the people ; whether they concur with us in seeing the necessity of a speedy convention, for the purpose of obtaining, in a constitutional and legal method, a redress of those grievances under which we at present labour, and which can only be effectually removed by a full and fair representation of the people of Great Britain, The London Corresponding Society cannot but remind their friends, that the present crisis demands all the prudence, unanimity, and vigour, that ever was or can be exerted by men and Brtons; nor do they doubt but that manly firmness and consistency will finally, and, they believe, shortly terminate in the full aecomplishment of all their wishes. I am, felow citizen (in my humble measure) a friend to the rights of man, , Harpy, Secretary. 
BOWER 558 “ Resolved unanimously,. 1. That, dear as justice and liberty are to Britons, yet the va lue of them is comparatively small without a dependence on their permanency, and there can be no security for the continuance of any right but in equal laws. 
BOWER 559 “ 2, That equat laws can never be expected but by a full and fair representation of the people ; to obtain which, in the way pointed out by the constitution, has been and is the sole object of this society ;. for this we are ready to hazard every thing, and never but with our lives will we relinquish an object which involves the happiness, or even the political existence, of ourselves and posterity. 
BOWER 560 “3, That it is the decided opinion of this society, that to secure ourselves from future feed: and scandalous prosecutions; w prevent a repetition of wicked and unjust se tences, and to recall those wise and wholesome laws that have been wrested from us, and of which scarcely a vestige remains, there ought to be immediately a convention of the people, by delegates deputed for that purpose from the different societies of the friends of freedom, assembled in the various parts of this nation, and we pledge ourselves to the public to pursue every legal method speedily accomplish so desirable a purpose. 
BOWER 561 “Postscript. I have to inform you, that 4 general meeting of the society will be holdea on Monday the 14th of April, the place to be ; announced by public advertisement.

WOOD 589 “A parliamentary reform is that which of allother things, in our opinion, deserves the attention of the public. We are more and mure convinced, by every day’s experience, that the restoring the right of voting universally to every man, not incapacitat by nature, for want of reason, or by law for commission of crimes (together with anDual elections) is the only reform that can be effectual and permanent. As Providence has kindly furnished men in every station with faculties necessary for judging of what con-y cerns themselves, it is somewhat strange that the multitude should suffer a few, with no better intellects than their own, to vsuxr the iaportant power of governing them without control, i t has has been a long and very just complaint, that a very great majority of the people of this country are not represented in pariament; that the majority of the representatives of the whole nation are chosen b number of voters not exceeding twetve t sand, Many large and populous towns have not a single vote for a representative, such as Birmingham, containing about 40,000 inhabitants, Manchester above 30,000, Leeds above 20,000, besides Sheffield, Bradford, Wolverhampton, Halifax, &c. &c. ‘

We began this society last January; and, since we published our declaration and resolutions, we have increased so rapidly in number and respectability, that we were under the necessity of dividing into different companies to meet at separate houses, and each division sends a delegate to meet as a committee, to transact the business of the whole society, The indorsed papers will inform you more fully of the principles we set out upon. Be so good as to deliver them to the president or secretary of your society. As I know you to bea friend of freedom, you will endeavour to proTavte a union between the two societies; for, by uniting together, we shall become stronger, and a three-fold cord is not easily broken,—I am, sir, with great respect, your most humble Servant, Thomas Harpy, secretary.

BOWER 641 We will now read the Address. 
LAUZUN 642 I found this paper in the prisoner’s house. 
LAUZUN 643 he London Corresponding Society's Address and Resolutions of the 24th of May, 1792; reprinted and distributed gratis. Assured that man, individual man, may justly claim liberty as his birthright, we naturally conclude that, as a member of society, it becomes his indispensable duty to preserve inviolate that liberty for the benefit of his fellow citizens, and of his and their posterity. For, as in associating, he gave up certain of his rights, in order to secure the possession of the remainder, and polunterily yielded up only as much as was necessary for the ral goud—so he may not barter away the liberties of his posterity, nor desert the common cause by tamely and supinely suffering to be purloined from the people of whom he makes a part, their natural and unalienable nicuTs oF RESISTANCE TO OPPRESSION, and Of SHARING IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THEIR COUNTRY ; without the full and uninterrupted exercise of which ricuts, no man can with truth call himself or his couatry free. 
LAUZUN 644 “ Yet of late, the very men who have dared to oppress the nation, have also dared to advance, that edf resistance to their oppression is illegal; while on the other hand, rraup or FORCE, sanctioned by custom and blind submission, has withdrawn, and now withholds, from a very great majority of the tax-paying, industrious, and useful inhabitants of Great Britain, the arcu of sharing in the governthe management of their own interests. 
LAUZUN 645 he few who are now permitted to elect representatives, and those who are chesen by this small number of electors, disgrace the country at large by buying and selling votes, by corrupting re being corrupted—the former by their behaviour at elections, and the latter by their conduct in the senate—more than sufficient to prove, that THE NATION IS UNREPRESENTED, and that THE PRESENT SYSTEM JS TOTALLY uNconstTITuTIoONAL—if by the word conetitue tion, any thing is meant. 
LAUZUN 646 “ Roused at last from their torpor, and i god remedy the evil,—various, numerou: and respectable societies have been form by the peuple, in different parts of the kings dom, several have also arisen in the metro polis; and among them the London Corresponding Society, with modesty, but with firm. ness, claim the attention of their country to the following resolutions ; 
LAUZUN 647 “ Resolved, 
LAUZUN 648 “ I. That every individual has a right to share in the government of that society of which he is a member, unless incapacitated. 
LAUZUN 649 “ II. That nothing but nonage, privation of reason, or an offence against the general laws of society, can incapacitate him. 
LAUZUN 650 “ III. That it is no Jess the riont than the puty of every citizen to keep a watchful eye on the government of his country, that the Jaws by being multiplied do not degenerate into oppressiwn; and that those who are entrusted with the government, do not substitute privute interest for public advantage. 
LAUZUN 651 “ IV, That the people of Great Britain are not effectually represented in parliament. 
LAUZUN 652 “ V. That in consequence of a partial, unequal, and therefore inadequate representation, together with the corrupt method in which representatives are elected; oppressive taxes, unjust laws, restrictions of liberty, and mgsting the public money, have nuied. 
LAUZUN 653 “ VI. That the only remedy to those evils, is a fair, equal, and impartial representation of the people jn parliament. 
LAUZUN 654 “ VII. That a fair, equal, and impertial representation tan never take place untill alt partial privileges are abolished. 
LAUZUN 655 “ VIII. That this society do express their abhorrence of tumult and violence, aiming at reform, not anarchy, reason, firmness, and unanimity, are the only arms they themselves will employ, or persuade their fellow citizens to exert, against ABUSE OF rOwER. Signed by order of the committee, 
LAUZUN 656 , Harpy, secretary. “ April ed, 1799. “ The London Corresponding Society to the 
LAUZUN 657 Nation at large. 
LAUZUN 658 “ Whereas it is notorious, that very numerous, burthensome, and unnecessary taxes are laid on the ns and families of us and others, the industrious inhabitants of Great Britain, an exceedingly great mejority of whom are, notwithstanding, excluded from all representation in parliament. 
LAUZUN 659 And as upon inquiry into the cause of this grievance, which is at once an obstruction to our industry, and diminution of our property, we find that the constitution of our country (which was purchased for us at the expense’of the lives of our ancestors) has, hy the violence and intrigue of criminal and designing men, been injured and undermined in its most essential and important parts: but particularly in the House of Commons, where the whole of the supposed representation of the people is neither more nor less than an usu power, arising either from abuses in the mode of election and duration of parliaments, or from a corrupt property in certain decayed corporations, by means of which the liberties of this nation are basely bartered away for the private profit of members of liament. 
LAUZUN 660 “ And as it further appears to us, that until this source of corruption shall be cleansed by the information, perseverance, firmness, and union of the people at large, we are robbed of the inheritance so acquired for us by our forefathers: and that our taxes, instead of nang lessened, will go on increasing: inasmuch as they will furnish more bribes, places, and pensigns to our minister and members of parliament. 
LAUZUN 661 “It being resolved by us, the members of this society, to unite ourselves into one firm and permanent body, for the purpose of informing ourselves and others of the exact state of the present parliamentary representation— for obtaining a peaceful but adequate remedy to this intolerable grievance—and for corresponding and co-operating with other societies united for the same objects, the following regulations for the internal order and governsion shall divide again, til it amount to double such number of members; at which time notice shall be given to the committee of delegates hereafter mentioned, by the them delegates of such division. 
LAUZUN 662 «Fourthly. That each division shall meet weekly, on any evening (Thursday excepted) at some house to be chosen by themselves, and appoint a chairman for the Bas order thereof; and also shatl name a delegate as hereafter mentioned. 
LAUZUN 663 “ Fifthly. That each member shall pay te the secretary‘of his division one penny per week, or one shilling and a penny per quarter; which shall be credited to the account of such member in a book to be kept for that purpose. That all mony paid shall be transmitted monthly, by delegate of such’ division, to the treasurer, who is to account with the body of delegates for the same, onthe four usual quarter-days. 
LAUZUN 664 “ Sixthly. ‘That the sums so paid to the said treasurer shall form one commen stock, to be applied by ‘the said delegates in the postage of letters, in stationary, and in printIng such matters as may be good for the imformation of the society. But that before any expense whatever shall be incurred, the said delegates shall inquire of the treasurer what balance he has in hand. Seventhly. That the delegates so appointed shall meet on Thursday in every week, and shall continue in office for three months; subject, however, to be recalled or superseded by their several divisions befgre the expiration of that time, if thought necessary. ‘That being assembled, they shall name a chairman and secretary, who shall both sign ail the public acts of the society. 
LAUZUN 665 “Eighthly. That sueh delegates so assembled, shall in the first place communicate ment of our society, have been unanimously adopted: 
LAUZUN 666 “First. That every person, before he is admitted, shall be proposed by two members, and shall answer in the affirmative to the three following questions, viz. 
LAUZUN 667 “ Question . Are you convinced that the parliamentary representation of this country is at present inadequate and imperfect ? “Q. 11. Are you thoroughly persuaded that the welfare of these kingdoms requires thot every person of adult years, in possession of his reason, and not incapacitated by crimes, should have a vote for a member of parliament ? 
LAUZUN 668 “Q, TIL. Will you endeavour, by all justiftable means, to promote such reformation in parliament ? 
LAUZUN 669 “ Secondly. That the whole body shall gounder one common name of the Londox Corresponding Society, united for the reform of parliamentary Representorign. 
LAUZUN 670 hirdly. That for the more easy and orderly-proceeding of the society, it be separated into as many divisions as there shall be thirty members to make up the number requisite for such division, And that no divi- i the wishes of their several divisions, relative to any objects of the society. Thatthey shall be authorized to answer any correspond which may require immediate attention ; an afterwards, that each delegate shall report the same to his respective division. Also, that they shaH consider of the general state of the society: but shall .on no account publish any new principle, or set of principles, until the same shall be approved by a majority of the individual members of the society at large. 
LAUZUN 671 “Ninthly. That it shall be necessary for two-thirds of the said socesiet to form a committee for the dispatch of business. And, enthly. That these resulutions and regulations be printed for the members of the society, and that a copy be given to cach member on his admission. 
LAUZUN 672 “ Maurice Marcarot, chairman. 
LAUZUN 673 “ Thomas Harpy, secretary. 
LAUZUN 674 “ Forasmuch as it is possible that the grounds of our complaint may be denied, and that our views and principles may be misrepresented, we desire that every one will seriously consider and treasure in his memory the state of scandalous facts which follow
GRANT 675  
LAUZUN 676 Let him then ask himself, whether it be the art of a good citizen to sit quiet under such abuses, which have not only increased, but are at this moment increasing; and which ought therefore to be remedied without delay. ill the reign of Henry Gth it was not necessary for the inhabitant of a county to have a freehold estate of 40s. a year, in order to vote for the representative of his county. But the statute of that king, passed in the year 1429, under pretence of preventing disputes at elections, most unjustly deprived a t part of the commons of this nation of the right of consenting to those taxes which, moiwithstanding, they were compelled to pay, just as if such right had not been taken them. 
LAUZUN 677 “ Till the reign of queen Anne, is was not pecessary for the inhabitant of a county to have 600. a year, freehold or copyhold estate, in order to his being elected the representative of his county. But the statute of that queen, posed in the year 1710, under pretence of the freedom of parliament, excluded all persons not possessed of such a property from our representation, whatever be their principles, their abilities, or their integrity. 
LAUZUN 678 ill the reign of William Srd parliaments were of gicur to be called once a year, or oftener ifneed be. Butthe statute of that king, passed in the year 1694, under pretence of calling them more frequently, enacted, that they should be holden once in three yeurs at the least. 
LAUZUN 679 “ Till the reign of George 1st, parliaments were therefore of three years duration. But the statute of that king, passed in the year 1715, under pretence of a ‘restless faction’ then existing in the nation, usurped a power of enacting, that ‘ parliament should respectively have continuance for seven years.’ 
LAUZUN 680 “As for the supposed representation of the people, which 1s called the ‘ Commons of England in Parliament assembled ;’ 
LAUZUN 681 he county of Cornwall contains in itself alone the privilege of sending forty-four members to parliament, which is just one less in number than those of the whole kingdom of Scotland, containing upwards of three millions of people. 
LAUZUN 682 “ Of these forty-four supposed representatives, two are elected by the frecholders of the county: the rest sit for twenty-one corporation towns; of which 
LAUZUN 683 Electors. Property of Launceston -- 10 - Lord Elliot Leskeard:- 9 Ditto Lestwithiel-. 7 - Duke of Northumberland Truro --- 13 -- Lord Falmouth Bodmyn --
GRANT 684  18 -- Sir Francis Basset Helston --- 3 Duke of Leeds, &c, Seite eee 16 - Sir Francis Basset East Loe ---- 20 West Loe 20 3 Judge Buller Grampound 30 -- Lord Sommers, &c. amelford 6 -- Lord Camelford Penrhyn «. 0 -- Sir Francis Basset

LAUZUN 689 St. Michael-- 14 -- DukeofNorthumberland Newport -St. Mawes -- 15 -- Marquis of Buckingham Callingham-- 30 Lord Falmouth 
LAUZUN 690  80 Lord Lovaine 
LAUZUN 691 Electors 453, Members 42.“ To these we might add, of the same description, 28 corporations, consisting of 354 electors, which send 56 members to that House of Commons, which is so frequently and so falsely called the democracy of the nation; while the towns of Shetheld, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Wolverhampton, &c. containing above three hundred thousand people, have no electors or representatives whatever. 
LAUZUN 692 “ Upon the whole it appears, that 257 supposed representatives of the People making a majority of the House of Commons, are returned by a number of voters, not exceeding the thousandth part of the nation. 
LAUZUN 693 “ But as Providence has aul furnished men, in every station, with faculties necessary for judging of what concerns themselves, shall we, the multitude suffer a few, with no better right than ourselves, to usurp the power of governing us without control? Surely not'!—Let us rather unite in one common cause, to cast away our bondage; being assured, that in so doing, we are pro tected by a jury of our countrymen, while we are discharging a duty to ourselves, to our country, and to mankind. Ordered that the secretary of the society, do transmit copies of the above to all the societies in the nation, engaged in the same cause. 
LAUZUN 694 “ London, May 24, 1792. 
LAUZUN 695 “ Address from the London Corresponding: Society, to the Inhabitants of GreatBritain, on the subject of a Parliamentary Reform, 
LAUZUN 696 “ Fellow Citizens,—Of every rank and of every situation in life, rich, poor, high or low; we address you all as our brethren, on a subject of the highest importance, and most intimately connected with the welfare of every individual who deems liberty a blessing, who partakes in the prosperity of his country, and who wishes to transmit as much of either as he possibly can, to posterity. 
LAUZUN 697 “ Uninfluenced by party pique or selfish motives—no ways affrighted at the frowns of power—not in the least awed by the evidently hostile preparations of a much alarmed aristocracy, we, the London Corresponding Society, united with a view of obtaining a Tuoroucn PariraMentary RerorM, anxiously demand your serious and most collected attention to the present vitraTED state of the British government, we entreat you to examine coolly and impartially the Numerous abuses that prevail therein, their destructive consequences on the poor, and their evil tendency on all; as also the rapidity with which these abuses increase both in number and magnitude. 
LAUZUN 698 “ We next submit to your examination an effectual mode of putting a stop to them, and of thereby restoring to our no less boasted than impaired constitution, its pristine vigour and punty: and we thereunto warmly solicit the junction of your efforts with ours. 
LAUZUN 699 his great end however we believe attainable, solely, by the whole nation deeply impressed with a sense of its wrongs, uniting, ane as it were with one voice demanding of those to whom fur a while it has entrusted its sovereignty, a restoration of, annuALLY ELECTED PaRLIAMENTS, UNBIASSED AND UNBouGut ELEctIoNs, AND AN EQUAL RepreSENTATION OF THE Wuoitr Bopy oF THE Pzopte. 
LAUZUN 700 “ Leaving to the enemies of freedom, all violent, tumultuous, and unconstitutional proceedings, we invite you to. peaceful, wellregulated, and neighbourly meetings, wherein Sealtatcods worthy citizens may as honest men, as good patriots, in a reasonable and sensible manner, laying aside prejudice, seriously and earnestly take into consideration their rights, and the welfare of the present and succeeding generations. 
LAUZUN 701 “ As men can never barter away the rights of their posterity —as eneroachmentson liberty or property cease not to be grievances from their being customary and of Jong stenting and ag a grievance is not the less felt for being denied by those who cause it—fceling grievances enormous,—seeing our liberties encroached upon and endeavoured to be entirely purloined from us—as also that our plaints are derided by government, and ourselves unlawfully menaced by. those in power, we call upon you all, Britons, to remember your privileges as such, and to assert your rights as men—to pay all proper regard to your native freedom; and to consider that, being the property of no man, nor of any set of men, it is ighly disgraceful for you to suffer yourselves any longer te be thus enslaved and disposed of as cattle in a fair, as irrational beasts in a market, to the highest bidder. 
LAUZUN 702 “ Laying aside all pretensions to originality, we claim no other merit than that of reconsidering and verifying what has already been urged in our common cause by the duke of Richmond, Mr. Pitt, and their then honest party, years back; now differing from them, we support with candour and zeal (thereby op ourselves no courtiers) the banner eftruth already displayed against the oppressors of mankind, and we take a pride in acknowledging ourselves a part of that useful class ofcitizens-whioh placemen (pensioned with the extorted produce of our daily labour) and proud nobility wallowing in riches (acquired somehow) affect to treat with a contempt too degrading for human nature te bear, unless reconciled to it by the reflection, that, though their inferiors in rank and fortune, we equal them in talents, and excel them in honesty. “ Still, friends and fellow citizens, possessed of souls far superior to the evil spirit influencimg these oppressors, these debasers of mankind; instead of hating, we contemn them ; and our motive is not vengeance, but redress. “ A constitution we are said to possess, we are willing to believe it—if good, it allows redress to 2 complaining people—if excellent, as many assert, it must naturally point out the means thereof. Let it therefore be publicly and carefully examined—if it is really what it ought to be, it cannot be too well: known; if faulty, it cannot be too soon amended; nor can that be done by a more competent jud: the arte than the thus collected sense o! nation. 
LAUZUN 703 t is the right of every individual to be well acquainted with the laws that bind him ! but how is the peasant, the mechanic, the manufacturer, to obtain that necessary knowledge ; his time fully employed in labouring hard to provide a scanty meal for his family, and in earning wherewith to satisfy the frequent and peremptory demands of surly tax-gatherers, he has no leisure for suc intricate political researches ; and even was he, by stealing that leisure from his labour or his sleep, to acquire the desired insight—still with spirits depressed by his suffering, with fears increased by the clamorous threats of the pensioned all-devouring locusts in office, the sore-oppressed subject feels the remedy to be far out of his reach, and dreads the consequence of being even supposed to know how greatly he is wronged: Such being the forlorn situation of three-fourths of the nation, how’ are Britons to obtain information and redress? Will the court, will ministry, afford either? Will parliament grant them? Will the nobles or the clergy ease the peopte’s suffering? No. Experience tells us, and' proclamations confinn it, that the interest and the intention of power are combined to keep the nation in torpid ignorance! 
LAUZUN 704 “ The only resource then, friends and feHow citizens, villbe found in those societies which, instituted with a view to the public good, promote a general instruction of our rights as men, expose the abuses of those in power, and point out the only constitutional, the only effectual means of forwarding a public investigation, and obtaining a complete redress for a people in whose credulous good nature originated their present difficulties. 
LAUZUN 705 We will not hurt your feelings by a minute detail of our common grievances; you cannot be ignorant, friends and fellow sufferers, how generally power, place, pension, and'title, are the rewards uf men whose services to the court have been of the greatest prejudice to the country. You painfully feel the consequences; increased taxes, a great part of which are most vilely squandered; a heavy national debt, begun With a design of forming 
LAUZUN 706 & powerful and monied court-party ; contitued with nearly the same view, unto its ptesent enormous bulk, and from its commencement militating against our liberties! Too visible are the numerous encroachments on our rights, too common the insolence of office, the venality of magistracy, the pervereion of the laws, the letting loose the military on every occasion, and those occasions eagerly sought. The subject’s complaints derided—the one part of the nation turned into spies and informers against the other—the—but wherefore more? Is here not enough to prove beyond a doubt, that while we boast the best constitution, the mildest laws, the freest government, we are in fact slaves ! “ Yet, fellow citizens ! numerous as are our gieences and close rivetted as weighty to shackles on our freedom; reform one alone, and the others will all disappear. If we once regain an anually elected parliament, and that parliament to be fairly chosen by all, thetga will again share in the government of their country, and their then unbought, unbiassed 8 must undoubtedly select a majority of honest members, while the very few unsound ones, that may accidentally obtain seats, will, from the consideratiun of their annual dependance on the people, think it highly advisable to continue the disguise that procured them their election, and at least wear the mask of honesty—a mask neither at all times necessary, nor at all times worn, in &septennial parliament. “ Let no man imagine himself unconcerned in the proposed reform—let no one think so meanly of his situation or abilities, as to suppose his coming forward will be of no service to the cause of liberty! numbers, union, and Perseverance must in the end be crowned with success, while compared with the small efforts of each individual associating and thereby countenancing the demand of the cae) na be ana to its cons taoral nghts! how great will appear the advanta, resulting thertives — al “ An HONEST PARLIAMENT! 
LAUZUN 707 “An ANNUAL PARLIAMENT ! 
LAUZUN 708 “ A PARLIAMENT waerrin EACH INDIVIDUAL WILL HAVE HIS REPRESENTATIVE. 
LAUZUN 709 oy ten souk we “ fas schon a stored, the press free, the laws simpli jizes eniiin oed, juries independent, nealless places and pensions retrenched, immoderate salanes reduced, the public better served, taxes diminished, and the necessaries of life More within the reach of the poor, youth better educated, prisons less crowded, old age better provided for, and sumptuous feasts at the exine of the starving poor, less frequent. 
LAUZUN 710 not upon this, dear countrymen, as an enthusiastic vision; but rather let us together take a calm and reasonable review of such an liament assembled—let us in idea amtail their session unto even the short duration of thtee months in one year, of sixty-foor meetings for doing the annual business of the nation. Still five hundred honest men, meeting sixty-four times, with both intention aid capacity to serve their country, must do something, must employ their tinfe somehow. Contested elections, none or very few, and soon determined ; party debates, none, the interest of the people being one; long speeches much diminished, honest men seeking reason not oratory; no placemen in the senate, corrupt influence dies away, and with it all ious, obstinate, ministerial opposition to measures calculated fer the public good: detesting chicanery, oppression and injustice of every kind, this honest parliament, findin; that the laws wanted simplification a arrangement, would set about it, however destructive their labours might prove to the sordid interest of art ambitious judge, a prostituted council, a packed jury, or a vile herd of pettyfoggers, trading justices, bailiffs, or rune ne! 
LAUZUN 711 -“ Finding that a most extraordinary waste of public money had taken place under the different pretences of places, pensions, dontracts, armaments, subsidies, secret service money, &c. our honest and annual parliament would, after narrowly scrutinizing the same, retrench every sum, needlessly or wickedly laid out. 
LAUZUN 712 “ Recalling to their mind that wise and wholesome provision of the 12th of William 3rd, chap. 2, enacting, that all resolutions taken in the privy council shall be signed by such of the privy council as shall advise and consent to the same ; they would call for an immediate renewal of that long-suspended law, and by so doing, all destructive secret influence will be rooted up, and the people could then, at all times, discover who were their friends, and who their foes. 
LAUZUN 713 he people's parliament finding, that under various pretences grants of common land had been obtained by sundry persons, no ways to the benefit of the community, but very much to the distress of the poor, the same would be soon restored to the able, and the robbed peasant again enabled annually to supply his distressed family with en increased quantity of bread out of the profit arising from the liberty regained of grazing a cow, two or three sheep, or a brood of geese thereon. 
LAUZUN 714 “ With detestation would that parliament view any man enjoying the emoluments of six or seven places, either needless and overpaid, as requiring altogether but one officer, or else their several duties neglected, and the public thereby deprived of that service for which they pay their money. anieroas other reforms would undoubtedly take place, even in the first session of parliament so elected, dependent only on their electors the people. Untorn therefore by faction, undivided by party, uncorrupted by ministry, and. uninfluenced but by the gC 
LAUZUN 715 public ‘good, every transaction would tend to reform, and a strict economy, its natural consequence, might soon enable us to reduce our taxes; and by the integrity of parliament, that reduction would light upon such objects as best might relieve the poor. This to the people would prove an advantageous and a Qovel session, and to an honest parliament ot a tiresome one. 
LAUZUN 716 herefore Britons, friends, and fellow citizens, with hand and heart unite, claim whatis your right, persevere and be free; for who dare to withstand our justdemands! —oppression already trembling at the voice of iecividuale, will shrink away and-disappear for ever, when the nation united shall assert its privileges, and demand their restoration

LAUZUN 739 “Itis doubly deserving. our tharks, as it shows your kindness, as it will be useful in the formation of our infant society. We stand much in need of your experience in this particular, and we doubt not of your best assistance. We are surrounded by a majority,

We observe one expression, which mye “Numerous other reforms. would un doubtedly take place, &c. &c.’ But we ask how is that parliament to be chosen? Can we expect it from the present order of things? Would not all the evil be done away at once by the people assembled in convention? Does it appear probable that the odious laws which we complain of will be abolished any other way? o the eres arising from aristocracy be redressed while the retains its present authority in the legislature?

Again we find that the Friends of the People and the Society for Constitutional Information do not exactly agree. We could be glad to know the reason ; it seems to me as though the difference was this—the Friends of the People mean only a partial reform; because they leave out the words expressing the duke of Richmond’s plan and talk only of a reform; while the Manchester peuple seem to intimate, by addressing Mr. Paine, as though they were intent upon republican principles only: now, to come closer to the main question, it is only desired to know whether the generality of the societies mean to rest satisfied with the duke of Richmond’s plan only; or, whether it is their Private design to rip up monarchy by the Toots, and eee democracy in its stead, I shall now, sir, give you an exact account of what plan we could wish to obtain, which I have already moved for at our general meeting, viz. a full and equal representation of the whole body of the people, a general suffrage of votes, and and annual parliaments. I remember the Society forConstitutional Information intimated to us that Mr. Basham used to write to them in the name of the Revolution Society; if you approve of that appellation, pray be so kind as to give us a full and satisfactory answer.

They do not thereughly comprehend how it would be possible to incorporate with our society three of your members 
LAW 794 Norwieh, the residing in Norwich, inasmuch as it would be impossible to communicate to them at that distance all our correspondence, and they could not attend our committees, where the business is transacted. If it is information you want, they very readily will answer any question you may put to them; and, to that end, invite you to a -regular correspondence, As to the object they have in view, they refer you to their addresses: you will therein see they mean to disseminate political knowled a thereby engage the judicious part of the nation tu demand a restoration of their rights in annual parliaments, the members of those arliaments owing their election to the unfount and even unbiassed suffrage of every citizen in possession of his reason, and not incapacitated by crimes. They consider the obtaining such parliaments to be the ground work of every necessary reform ; to this theres fore they steadily adhere, and turn themselves neither to the right nor to the left, to follow any other plan whatever; the rules and order of their society being so plain and easy, that if they can get a majority of the nation to act as they do, the pone reform will effect itself. They look upon the trifling difference that may have arisen between the several societies to be of very little consequence, and think they will subside without any ways injuring the cause. 
LAW 795 “ They think ita matter of small importance whatever name you choose to adopt. They advise you to follow their plan, and divide yourselves into small societies, cach of which to choose a delegate; the delegates, when met, to form the committee, and transact the business of the society; afterwards, let each delegate report to his division the business so dune; let him admit fresh members, communicate fresh intelligence, encourage political discussion, or read to you such books as may convey the instruction your weaker members stand in need of ; but, above all, be careful to preserve peace and good order among you; let no dispute be carried to excess; leave monarchy, democracy, and even religion, entirely aside; never dispute on these topics, let your endeavours go to increase the numbers of those who wish for a full and equal representation of the people, and leave to a parliament, so chosen, to form plans for remedying the existing abuses ; should they then not answer your expectation at the year’s end, you may choose others in their stead. The committee offer you every assistance in their power, but request that your questions may relate chiefly to the methods of obtaining a reform in parliament. Like yourselves, they are friends to peace, not aiaceny: and well-wishers to the rights of man; yet not so sanguine in their expect: tions as to imagine those rights will Testored by the spontaneous consent of those who have so long deprived mankind of them. Understanding that ou are many societies in oa ek recommend to you to unite upon the plan before mentioned; the correspondence, then carried on by one committee, will serve you all: they likewise recommend the appointment of one of the least conspicuous of your members to receive such letters as may be sent to the society, lest, if he be well known about your town to be a member, some interruption might take place in the delivery. ‘

LAW 797 “ London, the 1st February, 1793. 
LAW 798 “ gentlemen, We are instructed by the committee of delegates of the London Corresponding Society to express the satisfaction they experience in finding, by your answer to our letter, that your society are willing to communicate freely with those whose friends they profess themselves to be: not the less determined to obtain the desired reform, had you refused to act in concert with us, we yet freely acknowledge that your concurrence will add great weight to our so just demand. Leaving' the distinctions of rank, talents, and fortune, entirely out of the question, on a subject in which every man is equally interested, all must be convinced, that when members of Parliameng demand a reform, abuses certainly exist; and that when men, distinguished for their knowledge of the laws, join in the purmal, is constitutionality is sufficiently warran 
LAW 799 “ With you we think, that ‘the common happiness of all’ is the only constitutional authority laws can claim—that laws so founded must meet the affections of the whole nation and that those who seek the most effectual means of obtaining such, ‘ equally promote the present peace and the future prosperity of their country.’ -‘Venerating with you our excellent constitution, we are firmly persuaded the restoring it to its primitive purity will be found a sufficient remedy agains every abuse we complain of. Did we, however, deem less highly of its principles, we could not be brought to think ourselves so greatly degene as to be unequal to the Bike| of a task which our forefathers undertook, without fearing it would prove beyond their strength, not to disgrace them by supinely submitting to a total overthrow of the glorious fabric, reared by their yalour and cemented with their blood, from premature apprehensions of ‘ the tempest that mightensue’ in a conflict of oppression against general good—pecuniary interest, and life Itself, are never to be brought into competition with liberty. “ We thank your society for your kind advice concerning peace, order, and obedience to the laws: we made them the foundation of our union, as our addresses sufficiently evince—we have never d from obedience, and have thereby frustrated evil designs of all those who militate against reform. You acknowledge, that ‘ te wish success to the cause of freedom is congenial to the heart of a Briton,’ instead therefore Bod admitting your argument against our havi: published such Datiaiense by a friendly ade dress to the National Convention of France, that you, that all other societies, that the whole nation did not catch the generous flame, and follow our example—as to the handle likely to be made of it by our corrupt opposers (and well we have noted them), let them use it like most of their other machinaaa it will only accelerate that which they read. 
LAW 800 “ We must observe, that at a time when the enemies of mankind are exerting every Ee to crush the infant effort ef French hi
LAW 801 'y, it became our duty, as friends to human happiness, to express the just abhorrence we entertained of a manifesto which we conceived aimed, not so much at the liberty of France as at the liberty of the world. But to make any particular comments upon that manifesto is now unnecessary, as it might be unsafe—we only wish every Briton to peruse it. 
LAW 802 iad seepardliens of any evil intention, which the malice of our enemies may attribute to our conduct, we remain conscious of our rectitude; and that we therein acted up to the free, open, manly, generous national character of Britons—a character which oppression, assisted by enervating luxury, has not yet been able to entirely extinguish. 
LAW 803 “Unnoticed, however, you have tree over our statement ofabuses, our addresses to the nation, our demand of protection, addressed to those whose duty it is to afford it, and our answer to the calumnies of Mr. Reeves’s association, we request your notice ofthem. Pressed likewise by our numerous country correspondents to give them authentic information of what measures you mean to pursue when you mean to begin, and how far you intend carrying your proposed reform; we beg your explicit answer on these heads, and that you will enable us speedily to rightly inform the country thereon—no ways doubting, but that from your answer, we shall be enabled to assure them that you are really what your title imports, the Friends of the People, for many thousands of whom, in the name of the London Corresponding Society, united in one common interest and pursuit, with man other societies in different parts of the isl. altogether forming no despicable number of usotal members of society; we have the honour of subscribing ourselves, your fellow. labourers, and humble servants. 
LAW 804 “ Sir; I am directed by the Society of the Friends of the People to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated February 1, 17953 
LAW 805 having pledged ourselves by our public actsand documents, to use every effort in our power for the purpose ofobtainingacomplete, substantial, andi radical reform of the representation uf the people in parliament, we never can be cos posed to have surrendered to any other body of men the exercise of our own discretion, with respect both to the plan which we deem most effectual for the purpose, and the time which we may think most favourable for offering it to the public; at present we think, that to make public our views on these subjects, would be to furnish arms to our enemies, and to injure the cause in which we are engaged. The period, however, is probably not very far distant when these particulars will be made known to the public; it is sufficient now to apes our confidence, 
LAW 806 1 that moment will prove by evidence More substantial than professions; that we will propose no plan of reform which is short of an effectual destruction of abuses in the representation of the people, and that we have honestly exerted every faculty we possess in choosing the time most favourable to the success of our plan. 
LAW 807 “ We have learned, with affliction and indignation, the arbitrary and unconstitutional interruption of meshing of citizens, peaceably and lawfully assembled for the discussion and maintenance of their rights. We have ever viewed with utter disapprobation both of their principles and proceedings, the associations who have been the authors or instruments of this persecution. Their principles, we think, are repugnant to the free spirit of the English law; and their conduct, we think, has been as injurious and oppressive, as the principle of their institution is unconstitutional and absurd. But deeply penetrated as we are with these sentiments, we neither possessed power nor legal competence to interpose for the protection of an individual, suffering even under the most unjust prosecution, we cannot therefore feel ourselves blameable for inaction in cases of which the particulars were never laid before us, and in which it might have been perhaps impossible, rae perhaps improper, for us to have interfe 
LAW 808 “‘We do not think it necessary to make any particular remarks on those publications which you have put forth; we are not called upon to pronounce any judgment on the publications of individuals or societies; and however we may lament the grievances of which some of your publications complain, our efforts must necessarily be limited to the object of our institution—the creation of an to speak the public voice in legislation. 
LAW 809 “We cannot help expressing some surprise at the information, that societies in different ts of the kingdom, who were solicitous about the nature and extent of our plans of reform, instead of expressing such solicitude to ourselves, should have chosen the indirect and oircuitous channel of apy other society. 
LAW 810 Had they applied to the Friends ef the People directly, they would assuredly have received every information compatible with prudence, and with a due regard to the success of our common cause. 
LAW 811 “On the subject of your correspondence with the National Convention of France, we freely communicated to you our opinion in our last letter; we see no reason to change the sentiments which we then expressed on the prudence and tendency of that measure, for though we not only ‘ acknowledge, but avow with pride, ‘ that to wish success to the cause of freedom is congenial to the heart of a Briton ;’ yet we cannot think that men engaged in so momentous a cause, as that of parliamentary reform, are. entitled to make public declarations, even of their most viriuous sentiments, in any manner which may injure that cause, serve the purposes, and strengthen the pretexts of its enemies. Far be it from us to treat with severity and rigour even those errors and indiscretions into which men may be betrayed by a generous zeal for the cause of freedom, but surely it cannot be denied, that the correspondence of societies in this country with public bodies in France, has furnished the most specious pretences to interested men, for confounding a virtuous sensibility to the interests of liberty in other countries, with a criminal intention to introduce disorder and civil commotion into our own ; it is chiefly by the help of this pretext, that designing men have so successfully prace tised on the alarms of the Se and that timid honesty has been rendered the dupe and the instrument of corruption. But on this subject all further remark is now become unnecessary, as every good citizen must now feel himself precluded from all political intercourse with, France (for a period which we earnestly pray may be very short), by a war, the principle of which we utterly disapprove, the inevitable evils of which we deeply deplore, and at the possible consequences of which we tremble. Among the most wise and honest friends of liberty there must arise frequiens differences of opinion and of conduct; and these differences, the natural effect of an independent judgment and independent spirit, are perfectly compatible with mutual confidence nde g co-operation; when indecd designing persons avail themselvesof such differences, tosow distrust, and to insinuate suspicivas against the characters and intentions of men, it is then only that they become perniciousand injurious, Against practices which might produce such a spirit of disunion and distrust, it is surely almost unnecessary to warn the friends of liberty, at a moment when our enemies are so formidable and so united. They havesacrificed all inferior interests and all former differences to their common interest, in perpetuating abuses and corruptions. Let it not be said, that more generous motives have a less powerful influence on the human mind, and that the love of liberty is not able to produce that union among her friends, whieh in her enemies has arisen from the most abject and sordid passions. 
LAW 812 “ It seems scarce necessary to represent to the London Corresponding Society the pe‘culiar necessity of circumspection and moderation, at a moment when the most venial indiscretion of the friends of reform is remarked with such malignant watchfulness, and converted into an argument against the cause of reform itself. 
LAW 813 “ He must surely either be a secret enemy, or an unsafe and pernicious friend of that cause, who could prompt you to any thing that could be construed into indiscretion, or who would labour to sow distrust among the small number of those who now appear in behalf of freedom in England, at a period when a persecution is carried on against the friends of reform at home, and a war is commenced, which in its progress may combine the arms of England with those of powers engaged in a crusade against the general liberties of Europe

LAW 815 o Mr. Thomas Hardy, secretary to the London Corresponding Society. 
LAW 816 “ Mr. Edward Lauzun deposed, that he found the following paper in Mr. Hardy’s house. Sir, The committee of the London Corresponding Society have at present to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th of apa f “ With pleasure we perceive your societ not unwillin gto keepupacorrespondence wit! tus, yet at the same time we are sorry that you should appear to be hurt by the plain questions we put to you in our last; to ask of you what measures you mean to pursue in a matter which concerns us all, is certainly ne ways calling upon you to surrender up to our society, or even to the public at large, your discretion ; nor can we conceive that a of men having pledged themselves to the public, can be a sufficient security to that public to repose implicit confidence in them, without being made further acquainted with the nature and extent of the plan you mean to pursue, in order that we the people may, if we approve it, co-operate with you; the extent of your porponedt refers we apprehend is already determined upon, and we can discover no advantage likely to result from its secrecy ; on the contrary, if we are to ask for ourselves the same thing which our friends mean to ask for us, the latter must receive their instructions from us, or we must be ditected by them ; in either case there must be no secrets ; we further conceive, that the permanency of a reform must be founded on the ee of the public, who after merely berating om every thing proposed, have found your plan the most useful and the best that could possibly be laid down. The business we are engaged in is of too important a nature to admit of reserve or disguise ; 
LAW 817 we will therefore, by the frankness of our behaviour, show ourselves worthy the friendship of a society of honest men endeavouring to serve their country, and plainly tell you our country correspondents did not desire us to inquire of you what you meant to do, but fairly asked us whether we thought you honest? whether we thought you meant to serve 2 party, or the nation? whether we imagined you intended a partial or a complete reform? Addressed in this manner to us, and blunt as these questions may appear, they have nothing in them whieh can possibly offend you, the people having always an undoubted right to scrutinize the character andprinciples of those who call themselves their friends, and, as such, avow an intention of bringing. forward measures in which we are so deeply interested. As to the furnishing our enemies with arms by a disclosure of our intention, we cannot conceive that demands, founded on constitutional rights, can lose any of their force by being made public. Reason (vires acquirit eundo) to triumph requires only to be known; and as none of the ple’s demands are founded on fallacy, to take the enemy by surprise weuld be unworthy of the public champions, and moreover, perfectly needless when truth and reason must unavoidably bear down aH before them without the assistance of guile. 
LAW 818 “ Under the idea that, where you say you neither possessed power, nor legal compe“tence to interfere for the protection of an individual, suffering under the most unjust prosecution,’ you allude to the case of our bill sticker, we must beg to set you right, and to inform you we never, as a society, sought the interference of any body of men; on the contrary, we are firmly persuaded, however hard such cases may bear upon individuals, they will eventually prove of service to the public, nothing having a greater tendency towards rousing the country from its too prevalent apathy, with regard to stretch of prerogative and abuse of power. 
LAW 819 “ As to our Address tothe French National Convention, we imagine it best to say ho more about it at present, only that if it has furnished pretexts to designing men, it has only saved them the trouble of seeking excuses elsewhere: but such men, eves without our aid, would have been at no loss ; at the same time, we are to believe the plan for war, if conceived before then, was by no means accelerated thereby; intended as preventatives, addresses might have been effectual, if they had not been more generally adopted; the only fault therein, that by a mistaken idea; the addressers mre credit to phe pei hes a ter a of energy t it posSoseed. ea agree wilt you, that umity of sentiment is ne-way ingpmpatible with diver. 
LAW 820 sity of opinion, and that the latter is natural to m mt minds; with the same object in view, their mode of pursuing it will andoubtedly differ; with caution, therefore, we will watch over those who wish to sow athe seeds of unnecessary distrust among us, and will at the same time take good care that the doctrine of implicit confidence may Dot gain ground among us; full as much as yoursetves, we plead the necessity of union among the friends of liberty, but isment that it is prevented, or at least retarded in many instances by the very same thing that promotes it among the enemies of reform, namely, interest; with them, all their interest is for the continuation of abuses, ‘while to some of us a reform must be attended with ‘pecumiary loss, and many others would lose their employ, their daily bread, were it dcpown they took an active part; thus, the same motive, assuming on one side the appearance of a virtue, gives emulation to bad amen, and on the other, in its vilest bat most aatural ferm, stays the pepsiess of those who, with the best intentions, labour to save their coentry.

GARROW 841 When were you, if ever, applied to to print 
GRANT 842 I was applied to some time in the aniddle or the latter end of the year 1792. 
GARROW 843 ‘Whom was that application made to you by 
GRANT 844 I believe by Mr. Gow. 
GARROW 845 "Wes that application made by him at the society, or at one of the division meetings 
GRANT 846 I do not know positively, but 1 know I refused to print something that was shown me. 
GARROW 847 I do not ask you the contents of that paper; but did you afterwards print any thing else for the society, which you were paid for by any of those persons that you have named 
GRANT 848 Yes: I printed a posting bill. 
GARROW 849 Upon whose application did you print that posting bill
GRANT 850 Mr. Richter. I read it over with Mr. Richter; and I agreed to print it, and did priat it. 
GARROW 851 Do you mean the same Mr. Richter that Lie have named as a member of the society 
GRANT 852 Yes. 
GARROW 853 Did you ever see Mr. Richter at any of those meetings of the divisions at which the prisoner att i—Yes. 
GARROW 854 You say you undertook to print that which Richter applied to you to print
GRANT 855 Yes ; five hundred copies. 
GARROW 856 Who pein pou for them 
GRANT 857 Mr. Hardy, the prisoner. 
GARROW 858 Were there any directions ig you as to the time by which they would be required to be printed ? was there any extraordinary expedition required 
GRANT 859 They were ordered to be done as fast as possible ; and I recollect when they were done I ordered them to be sent toMr. Hardy’s ; and I imagine my order was complied with. 
GARROW 860 How soon after you had ordered them to be sent to Mr. Hardy’s did you see Hardy
GRANT 861 I dare say it wns two or three days after. 
GARROW 862 Did he pay you for those which you had ordered to be sent
GRANT 863 Yes; but they were sent back to my house. 
GARROW 864 Did he pay before the order came for sending them back to your house, or afterwards
GRANT 865 No. I was paid afterwards. 
GARROW 866 And then the papers were returned to your house
GRANT 867 They were returned the very same day they were sent. 
GARROW 868 What became of them after they were sent back to your house? did the circumstance which you were about to state come to your knowledge from Hardy, or did you ever converse with him upon. that subject 
GRANT 869 No; never. 
GARROW 870 Do you know of your own knowledge what became of the papers after they were returned to your house 
GRANT 871 They were given by my warehouseman to one Carter to stick up in the streets. 
ERSKINE 872 Did you see them given 
GRANT 873 No. 
GARROW 874 Do you know in fact that any of those bills that you printed, and which Hardy paid you fur, were stuck up in the streets of this town
GRANT 875 No; I could not swear that, for I did not see any to the best of my recollection. 
GARROW 876 Had you any conversation with Mr. Hardy respecting those papers which Carter was supposed to have had something to do with
GRANT 877 Yes. 
GARROW 878 What passed between Mr. Hardy and you upon that subject 
GRANT 879 Mr.. Hardy informed me that Carter had been taken up. You had given orders that these bills should be delivered to Carter ; were they in fact delivered out of your possession after they were returned from Hardy’s?—They were not delivered by my order to Carter. 
GARROW 880 Were they delivered out of your possession
GRANT 881 They were. 
GARROW 882 After that Hardy told you Carter had been taken up
GRANT 883 Yes, for putting up those bills, pats I told him I had been informed of before: 
GARROW 884 For putting up the bills, where 
GRANT 885 Up in the streets in this town, 
GARROW 886 Did any thing more pass upon that occasion 
GRANT 887 No. 
GARROW 888 Do you know that Carter was in fact in prison for posting up those bills
GRANT 889 I heard it from Mr. Hardy. I never saw him in prison. 
GARROW 890 Look at this, and tell us whether this is one of the bills that you printed 
GRANT 891 Yes, I believe that is the very identical bill; I have no doubt about it. 
GARROW 892 Had you any eonversation with Mr. Hardy with respect to any other papers which you had been applied to to print, and which you had ee print—did Mr. Hardy say any thing to you about your having declined to print for. the society 
GRANT 893 He did about an additional order that I had. 
GARROW 894 The first order you complied with was for five hundred 
GRANT 895 Yes. 
GARROW 896 Who gave you the additional order 
GRANT 897 There was. an order brought,I cannot tell by whom, to me, for five hundred large bills, and a thousand small ones. 
GARROW 898 Had you any conversation with Mr. Hardy about that additional order
GRANT 899 Yes: he said he had heard that I refused to print them. 
GARROW 900 Had you refused to print them 
GRANT 901 I had actually refused. 
GARROW 902 How long did you continue a member of the society after you had refused so to print for them
GRANT 903 In fact, I had not frequented the society for some time before that: I believe abat was in the end of November, or the beginning of December. 
GARROW 904 How much was the sum lie paid you 
GRANT 905 Two guineas. 
GARROW 906 You named Mr. Margarot as one ofthe persons psesent at those meetings: in what character did he act 
GRANT 907 He acted in the capacity of president of the delegates. 
GARROW 908 n what character did the prisoner, Hardy, act
GRANT 909 As secretary of the division, and likez as secretary of the society itself, I beeve. 
EYRE 910 Was there any secretary to the division 
GRANT 911 I do not know expressly; for I only was twice or three times at the farthest among the delegates. 
EYRE 912 And it was there that Hardy acted, was it
GRANT 913 He acted as secretary to the society at large. 
EYRE 914 Where was it that he acted
GRANT 915 At Mr. Byde's. 
EYRE 916 Do you mean that that was a meeting of the division or of the delegates 
GRANT 917 Of the division. 
GARROW 918 Were you ever at the Unicorn
GRANT 919 Yes; I was there once. 
GARROW 920 Try to recollect any of the members you saw there 
GRANT 921 There were a great many there ; I knew very few. 
EYRE 922 Was that a division meeting, or what
GRANT 923 I believe it was the same society moved from the Bell to the Unicorn, the same society or the same division that was there, 
EYRE 924 “ Address of the London Corresponding Society to the other Societies of Great Britain, united for the obtaining a reform in parliament. , 
EYRE 925 “ Friends and Fellow Countrymen; Unless we are greatly deceived, the time is approaching when the object for which we struggle is likely to come within our reach. That a nation like Britain should be free, it is requisite only that Britons should will it, to So. That such should be their will, the abuses of our original constitution, and the alarm of our aristocratic enemies, sufficiently witness. Confident in the purity of our motives, and in the justice of our cause, let us meet falsehood with proofs, and hypocrisy with plainness, let us persevere in declaring our principles, and misrepresentation will meet its due reward—contempt. 
EYRE 926 “In this view, the artifices of a late aristocratic association, formed on the 20th instant, call for a few remarks, on account ef the declaration they have published relative to other clubs and societies formed in this nation. It is true that this meeting of gentlemen (for so they style themselves) have mentioned no names, instanced no facts, quoted no authoTities ; but they take upon themselves to assert, that bodies of their countrymen have been associated, professing opinions favourable to the rights of man, to liberty, and equality ; and, moreover, that those opinions are conveyed in the terms, no King, no Parliament
GRANT 927  So much for their assertions. 
EYRE 928 “ If this be intended to include the societies to which we respectively belong, we here, in the most solemn manner, deny thelatter part of the charge; while, in admitting the former, we claim the privilege and glory in the character of Britons; whoever shall attribute te us, who wish only the restoration of the lost liberties of our country, the expressions of Ne King, No Parliament, or any design of invading the property of other men, is guilty of a e Mis an impudent, and a malicious falseood. 
EYRE 929 “We know, and are sensible, that the wages of every man arc his right; that difference of strength, of talents, and of industry, do, and ought to afford proportional distinctions of property, which when acquired and confirmed by the laws, is sacred and inviolable; we defy the most slavish and malevolent man in the meeting of the 20th instant, to bring the remotest proof to the contrary. If there be no proof, we call upon them to justify an insidious calumny, which seems invented only to terrify independent Britons from reclaiming the rightful constitution of their country. We adinit, and we declare, that we are friends to civil liberty, and therefore to natural equality, both of which we consider as the rights of mankind, Could we believe them to be ‘in direct opposition “ to the laws of this land,’ we should blush to find ourselves among the number of its inhabitants; but we are persuaded that the abuses of the constitution will never pass current for its true principles; since we are told in its first charter, that all are equal in the sight of the law, whichshall neither be sold, nor refused, nor delayed, to any freeman what“ soever ;’ should it ever happen that ‘ right and justice’ are apposed by expense, by refusal, or by delay, then is this principle of equality violated, and we are no longer free men. 
EYRE 930 “ Such are our notions of those rights which it is boldly maintained ‘ are inconsis“ tent with the well being of society.’ But let us not suffer men who avow no principles of liberty, whose favourite cry is inequality of Property, to estrange others of our countrymen from aiding us in serving the community, and from recovering to the nation that share of its:sovereignty which has unhappily been sacrificed to corrupt courtiers and intriguing boroughmongers. 
EYRE 931 “ Ifour laws and constitution be just and wise in their origin and their principle, every deviation from them as first established, must be injurious to the people, whose persons and property were then secured; if at the revolution this country was adequately represented, it is now so no longer, and therefore calls aloud for reform. 
EYRE 932 “ If it be true that the people of Britain are superior to other nations, is it that our taxes are less burthensome? or that our provisions are less expensive? is it from the various productions of our svil that we are rich? is it owing to the majority of our numbers that we are strong? Certainly not. France has the advantage in all these respects, and, up to this period, she has never Been our superior in wealth, in power, in talents, or in virtues. But let us not deceive ourselves, the diffcrence between us and that nation was formerly, that our monarchy was limited, while theirs was absolute; that the number of our aristocracy did not equal the thousandth part of theirs; that we bad trial by jury, while they had none; that our persons were protected by the laws, while their lives were at the mercy of every titled individual: we therefore had that to fight for which to them wasunknown; since we were men while they were slaves. 
EYRE 933 “¢ The scene indeed has changed; like our brave ancestors of the last ccntury, they have driven out the family that would have destroyed them; they have scattered the mercenaries who invaded their freedom, and have ‘ broken their chains on the heads of their oppressors.’ If during this conflict with military assassins and domestic traitors, cruelty and revenge have arisen among a few inhabitants of the capital let us lament these effects of a bloody and tyrannous manifesto, but let us Icave to the hypocrite pretenders to humanity, the task of blackening the misfortune, and attributing to whole nation the act of an enraged popuace. 
EYRE 934 “ As we have never yet been cast so low at the foot of despotism, so it is not requisite that we should appeal to the same awful tribunal with our Petiren on the continent. May our enmities be written in sand, but may our rights be engraven on marble! We de sire tu overthrow no property but what has been raised on the rums of our liberty: we look with reverence on the landed and commercial interests of our country, but we view with abhorrence that monopoly of burgage tenures, unwarranted by law or reason in this or any other nation in Europe. 
EYRE 935 “ Let us then continue with pleasure and firmness in the path which is begun; let us then wait and watch the ensuing sessions of ppulanceng, from whom we have much to nope, and little to fear. ‘The House of Commons may have been thd source of our calamity, it may prove that of our deliverance. Should it not, we trust we shall not prove unworthy of our forefathers, whose exertions in the cause of mankind so well deserve our imitation.

LAUZUN 940 “ Sir; The London Corresponding Society have at present to acknowledge your last, and to answer more fully your preceding letter. 
LAUZUN 941 “ With regard to petitioning parliament, we are unanimous in the opinion that such a petition will not produce a reform; yet, from many considerations, we are now persuaded that, if every society in the island will send forward a petition, we shall ultimately gain ground; for as much as it will force the present members of the senate to repeatedly discuss the subject, and their deliberations printed in the ditterent newspapers, will most naturally awaken the public mind towards the object of our pursuit. The nation once informed that a reform in parliament is suught for from difierent quarters, gives rise to debates in the House of Commons, and is acknowledged by every rank to be wanting, will begin to exercise their own reason on this subject; arrived at that period, we presume our business will be nearly accomplished. Let us then closely follow up our Nottingham brethren ; let every society petition separately; let every weck furnish a fresh petition, and afiord a fresh debate. We seek to open the cyes of the public: petitions on our part, and rejections on the part of the ministry, will effectually do it: we therefore highly approve of your idea, and will ourselves folTow it up, and recommend it to all the other societies we correspond with; and, withal, we recommend to you that no time be lost in 80 doing. 
LAUZUN 942 “ With you, we lament the evils of an imprudent and inconsiderate war—a war rather eagerly sought for the advancement of private ends, than carefully deprecated from considerations of public good; a contest unfavourable to this country, whether either France or despotism gain the upper hand. We join with you in gratitude to those worthy members of either House who have endeavoured to avert this national calamity, to whom we have likewise returned our public thanks; and we remain, with sincerity and affection,—yourfriends and fellow-labourers.

GARROW 956 “ Edinburgh, 25th of Mey, 1793. 
GARROW 957 “ Mr. Hardy, Sir, Mr. Urquhart did me the pleasure to call on Thursday afternoon, and delivered your letter of the 17th cusremt. I am much pleased with the contents of it, and shall lay it before the first meeting of our societies here, which however does not take place till Monday seven-night. I weuld have acknowledged the receipt of your favour by yesterday’s post, but was too much emluyed in removing our household to another lodging to attend to any thing else. 
GARROW 958 f either you in England, or we in Sceotland should attempt separately the reform which we, I trust, seek to obtain, we should, by so doing, only expose ous weakness, and manifest our ignorance of the corruption which opposes our important und ig. If we sought only the extirpation of one set of interested men from the management of national affairs, that place might be given to another set, without affecting the vitals adverse to the system of reform. These might be easily accomplished ; but to cut 2 deep and wide rooted prejudices, to give effectual energy to the dictates of truth, in favour of public virtue and national prosperity, in eppesition to self and all its interested habits, and to withstand and overawe the final efforts of the powers of darkness, is the work of the whole, and not of a part; a work to which mankind, till this awful period, were never adequate, because never till now disposed to traternize ; not merely, or only I trust, from the sense of the common danger to which we are exposed, but from the ennobling prim ciple of universal benevolence. 
GARROW 959 “1 know no greater service that I can do my conty than to promote the unien you so wisely desire ; and I am happy to assure you that I have hitherto discovered no sentiment in our association adverse to the mest intimate and brotherly union with the associationsin England. 
GARROW 960 I think the minds of all must, in the nature of things, be now turned to more effectual means of reform. Not one person was convinced of the necessity of it by the most convincing arguments of reason, together with the most unequivocal expressions of universe} 
GARROW 961 desire; what then is to be hoped for fromto be apprehensive of the abilities of our own repetition? I am only afraid that the bow in England against reform was so contracted that in returning, it may break. You would willingly learn, you say, from us: I own that we ought to be forward in this: we have at once, in great wisdom, perfected our plan of organization; and, if we were in the same independent state of mind asthe people of England, we would be able to take the lead. The associations with you are no more, I fear, (excuse my freedom) than an aristocracy for the good of the people: they are indeed moderate, firm, and virtuous ; and better cannot be : but we are the people themselves, and we are the first to show that the people can both judge and resolve, if undirected by faction, with both wisdom and moderation. 
GARROW 962 “I have not a higher wish, in the present exertions for reform, than to see the people universally and regularly associated, because I am persuaded that the present disastrous engagements will issue in ruin, and the people then must provide for themselves; and it would be unhappy, when we should be ready to act with unanimity, to be occupied about organization, without which, however, anarchy must ensue. We will not need but to be prepared for the event, to stand and see the “salvation of the Lord.’ Let us therefore take the hint given us by our opposers ; let us begin in earnest to make up our minds relative to the extent of reform which we ought to seek; be prepared to justify it, and to controvert objections; let us model the whole in the Public mind; let us provide every stake and stay of the tabernacle which we would erect, so that when the tabernacles of oppression in the palaces of ambition are broken down, under the madness and folly of their supporters, we may then, without anarchy and all dangerous delay, erect at once our tabernacle of righteousness, and may the Lord himself be in it! 
GARROW 963 “ How hurtful to the feelings of a reflecting mind to look back to the wretched state in which the Roman monarchy, enfeebled and ken by its own corruptions, left the nations which it had subjected! like ‘ sheep without a shepard they soon became a prey to every invader, because there was none to gather and unite them: had they, foresecing the evil, associated for mutual detence, no robber would have been able to enslave them; the would have given laws to all parties, as well as to theinsclves; all separate colonies and nations would have sought their alliance: but mot having virtue to associate and heal the divisions, and root out the selfish spirit, which ambition-fostering governments procure to their subjects, they fell under oppressors, from under whose iron sceptre they have never yet been able to deliver themselves. We may suppuse an event which we deprecate; nay, should we not be prepared for every possible issue of the present unprecedented divisions of mankind, we have a right managers, who are so afraid to depart from precedent, that, like men of detail, they may be inadequate to the task of preserving the vessel from shipwreck, now grappling with danger, not only great, but new and uncommon. If the present ministry fail, who after them shall be trusted? It requires little penetration to see the anarchy and discord which will follow: it will be such that nothing short of a general union among the people them selves will be able to heal: haste, therefore, to associate, at least to be ready to associate. If then, such a broken state of things should take place, the civil broils that would necessarily ensue, would soon subside before the united irresistible voice of the whole. Do not, I entreat you, hesitate thinking sueh a work premature as yet: but a month, and then it may be too late. A malignant may be already formed, and only waiting for the halting of the present managers ; it will then be too late to seck to‘subject to deliberation, after a party has dared the act of rebeh lien. If you go no further than separate meetings in different towns, we will not be able to confide in your confraternity, because, while in such a state, you may be but the tools of a faction. We could have all confidence, and unite with all affection in one assembly of commissioners from all countries of the world, if we knew they were chosen by the unbiassed voice of the people, because they would come up with the same disinterested views and desires as ourselves, havi all agreed to a common centre of union aud interest; but we could not confide in fellowcitizens who kept aloof from such union, and would not previously affiliate in one great and indivisible family. n troubling you with so long an epistle, I have atleast shown my inclination to core respond. I have also hinted at things which appear to me the present subjects of consideration, because I am desirous of your opinion upon them; I have possibly wrote with too much freedom, but you will place it to account of zeal in the cause, and on this score discharge my design, which is disinterested and hilanthropic.

Should be glad if you will inform me whether it was attended to; I gave myopinion on the subject to the Constitutional Society of London, and found their ideas congenial to my own, viz. an address to the king—futile; a petition to parliament (as a conquered people)—tolerable; a national convention (if circumstances admitted)—best of all. To what an alarming crisis are we arrived !—the junto is forme and established—the people become a prey, and (to adopt the phrase of an Hibernian Apostate) are treated as a swinish multitude, except the privilege of fattening.

LAUZUN 981 “ London 25th of July, 1793. 
LAUZUN 982 “ Fellow Citizen; The London Corresponding Society have received, and read with pleasure, your letter of the 25th of June; but the answer which you mention to have been made to our three questions has not yet come to hand. We shall be glad to be informed in Pad next, whether it was ever putin the postoffice. 
LAUZUN 983 “ With regard to the questions themselves, however individuals may have made up their minds on them, the public seemed most to approve the mode of petitioning parliament. We accordingly acquiesced, and sent in a petition signed by near 6,000 persons. With this letter you will receive a copy of it; and with its fate you are doubtless not unacquainted. 
LAUZUN 984 “ While we agree with you, that the people are treated like swine, we are forced to acknowledge, that some a fap from their sloth and ignorance, scarce M deserve better usage; however, unceasingly labouring to meliorate their condition as well as our own, and convinced that a thorough parliamentary reform is the only means of effectuating it, we firmly pursue our purpose, and in the most conspicuous manner; under the eye of the court, in the middle of the metropolis, and in the very nest of place and pension hornets, the tavern where Reeves, the tool of the junto, holds his inquisitorial tribunal, have ately held a general meeting of the society, sent forth an address to the nation, and entered into some spirited resolutions; a few copies of which we desire you to accept, and promulgate as far and as wide as you can; at the same time rest assured, that the firmness displayed therein is not confined to words, but that on every occasion our society will he found foremost in asserting and recovering the liberties of their country. 
LAUZUN 985 “ Exhorting you, therefore, to throw aside all unavailing complaint, we wish you to occupy yourselves in instructing the people, in invoducing and maintaining order and regularity in your own society, and in forming a junction with all others associated for the same purpose throughout the nation, b keeping up a constant correspondence wit! them; but above all, orderly and courageously preparing yourself for the event; for as it is natural to suppose that those who now pre on the public will not willingly yield up their enjoyments, nor repossess us of our rights without a struggle, which by their behaviour in Ireland we have some reason to think they are meditating, and perhaps may intend to effect by means of those very foreign mercenaries who are now paid by the sweat of our brow, and whom, under some plausible retence, it would be no difficult matter to land on our shore. It may be more advantageous to humanity to show them at first, that their opponents are neither mob nor rabble, but an indignant oppressed people, in whom is not yet entirely extinct the valour of their forefathers.

We are with sincerity, fellow citizens, for the London Corresponding Society, as your friends and fellow labourers for the good of our country, M. M. TAH 
ERSKINE 988 My lord, I should wish to put a questiou—the answer to which, indeed, already foresee—whether my friends across the table think there will be any probability of their being able to finish their evidence within a time that human nature is equal to pay attention to it; because if not, to be sure your lordships will be under the necessity of taking some step to hear this extraordinary cause in a manner consistently with that justice which is due both to the Crown and to the prisoner. I confess, that for one, I do not feel myself atall fatigued, and am extremely ready to go on, and to remain here any length of time which my duty to the prisoner can possibly require ; but if the evidence on the part of the crowa should go on to such an extent as that it would be impossible either fur your lordships or the jury to give any farther attention (and your a and thejury are but men), then the prisoner’s defence could not possibly be heasd; therefore, I should humbly suggest, if your lordships find it isin your power to put this into any traip,—I would ask my learned friends, whether they can finish their evidence tonight? 
BOWER 989 It is impossible. t 
EYRE 990 What is your own judgment as to the course we ought to pursue? Mr. Attorney General, have you nearly concluded your evidence ? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 991 Not half. 
ERSKINE 992 It is very material for us that the jury should hear. 
EYRE 993 As to what is now hinted at, itis matter of very great importance to the public justice of the country In every view of it. It is undoubtedly a general rule, that there is to be no adjournment and no separation of the jury after the evidence is entered upon, until the jury bave. given their verdict. That is a rule which I shall never willingly depart from, nor ever consent to depart from but ina case of extreme necessity, and where therefore the necessity of the case will justify a deviation from the strict rule of law. 
EYRE 994 I think the necessity does exist in every case in which it shal! appear that the cause wil] go into such a length that the attention of a jury cannot be kept alive to it throughout, without the assistance of some refreshment ; and where, from that length, they cannot have that assistance from the Court, which by law they are entitled to have; provided that necessity, therefore, is apparent in this case, I should certainly readily incline to enter intoa consideration of the qucstion, whether we can, and, if we can, whether we ouglit to adjourn ; and in what way it may be done. 
EYRE 995 I know that, in point of fact, there was anadjournmentin onecriminal case: but that was a misdemeanor : there was a doubt started whe“ther in that case, though the court adjourned, the jury should not be kept together. I have not been able to learn with any certainty what the fact was; but there is one circumstance from whence I do conclude that, in truth, the jury could not have been kept together during the whole of that time, because the adjournment thcre was over an entire day at two different times in the course of the hearing of that cause ; and I have no imagination that the jury were kept together during all that time, unless the adjournment oeerihe day was only for a few hours; but it is s0 long ago, that few people remember how it was; I conceive that, under that adjournment, the jury must have becn allowed to separate. 
EYRE 996 I am not satisfied that, in strict law, there is a clear distinction between the case of allowing a jury to separate in a misdemeanor and ma capital case. I believe the rule of lew is the same; and I am inclined to think that the strict rule was, that, even ina civil case, the jury could not separate after the ease was once gone into. 
EYRE 997 In the 14 Harry 7th, there was a question debated in the Exchequer Chamber (is in the year book) upon the effect of the jury having, in consequence of a violent storm to which they were exposed, separated for a time; they afterwards returned again, and delivered their verdict. But the principal doubt that arose in that case, was the circumstance of a juryman having taken some yefreshment from the hand of a friend of one of the parties; however, that question never was decided; and I do not know that there is any other case in which the question has been much considered : therefore, if the counsel for the prisoner make the application to the court upon the ground of a necessity interesting to the prisoner, andif the counsel for the prosecution consent to that application upon such grounds as are proper to influence the jadgmentof the prosecutor, it seems to me in some way or other, it would be right that an adjournment should take place. I showki have no difficulty with regard to the Court; the difficulty that occurs to my mind is with segard to the separation of the jury. ularly, and properly, and agreeably to the ancient course, the jury ought to be kept toether. 
EYRE 998 e There are a great number of civil cases in the old books where the jury could not agree, or something happened in the course of the cause that made it necessary for the Court to be consulted before the cause could proceed. The practice was where the jury was sent for from the country to Westminster-hall, there a hostel was provided for them, and they were always sent back to their hostel: there they were attended by an officer, and kept mm all communication: but modern times have totally changed the habits of business, and there are hardly any traces of that now left, and that sort of thing is impracticable. 
EYRE 999 I made some inquiry what might be done (the subject, you see, was not totally out of my thoughts) if it should so happen that the necessites of public justice should extort from us a departure from the general rule: and the sherills, who have been always disposed to do what is right for them to do, and to give us all the assistance that is possible, did promise that they would endeavour to accommodate the jury in this house: whether that can be done, or whether we can depart even from that strictness, and suffer the jury 0 go to their own houses, upon the application of the prisoner and the consent of the poses, taking their word of honour that they would have no communication with any body upon the subject of this cause; that is a question upon which i should much wish to hear what my brothers have to say, after asking the uestion again of the sheritl, what caa be one here? 
EAMER 1000 My colleague andIhave made the best provision the place will admit; we have prepared a room and beds. 
EYRE 1001 itis a distressing thing to put the jury into these circum stances, which I should be sorry for, but it is better than sitting up for three days and two nights, which, for any thing I can see, must be the case. I am very ready to take my share of the fatigue, but my apprehension is, that the cause cannot be so effectually tned as it would be if the Court and jury had the refreshment of food and rest. 
ERSKINE 1002 It is impossible to figure to one’s self a more delicate situation than that which we hold who stand ascounsel for a person who is upon trial for his life; at the same time, my lord, I can have no difficuky in saying thatshould think the prisoner at the bar perfectly secure in taking the solemn word of honour of each gentleman upvun the jury that he would not be approached (as no gentleman upon the jury would be approached) by any man living upon the subject of the cause: and Zam sure that, if I could not depend upon the word of honour of each gentleman of that jury, in fulfilment of that pledge, I should address them to very litte purpose, even upon their oath. I shall recommend, as to the prisoner at the bar, to give that indulgence to the gentlemen, under the very peculiar eircumstances of the case. 
EYRE 1003 I think it is not simply that he may give that ind I think he must ask it as necessary to his defence. 
ERSKINE 1004 I certainly advise him to ask it. Iask at upon the difference of being m this house or going to their homes. gentlemen seem to have paid very great attention to this cause hitherto; it is my earaest wish they may do so throughout, to the evidence on the part of the crowa as well as to theevidence on the part of the defendant ; andI am willing that they shall be as free as air, with the single restriction, that they will ot suffer themselves to be approached in the way of influence ; and the gentlemen will not thinkit much that that should be required, considering the very peculiar nature of this case. 
MACDONALD 1005 The reason why the jury should never separate was, that they should not give in their verdict under any improper impression : but if that should superinduce an atter impossibility that justice could be done either by the jury or the bench; pay, by the witnesses pessibly, whose recollection, if they sit up for many hours, must be extremely imperfect: and ifthe gentlemen at the bar cannot do justice to their clients on either side,—if that is the case, and justice cannot be done, you must look to the prisoner, his case requires equal regard. The prosecutor’s evidence had the opportunity of being heard when the jury were fresh; now, if they are incapacitated to attend to his case in the way that his case requires, justice will not be done to him. 
MACDONALD 1006 If we are under the absolute necessity of departing in some degree from the strict rule, I dank we'should depart as little as possible ; and, therefore, I confess the only hesitation in my mind is between the jury's being accommodated here and their going home to their own houses: I have a great deal of difficulty, I own, about that. 
ERSKINE 1007 I wish to be understood that it was a matter of great indifference to me, and it only arose from a desire I had in my mind that the jury should not be deprived of going home to their own families for want of a consent from me, and I am persuaded I hazard nothing by that consent. 
GARROW 1008 We have the same anxious desire, provided it can be done consistently with the rules of law, that the jury may be accommodated. 
EYRE 1009 If the jury live at a great distance, they might rather choose to sleep here. e 
JURYMEMBER 1010 I live at Marybone, and am rather an invalid, but I would rather go home. 
HOTHAM 1011 Mr. Erskine stated himself to be in a very delicate situation, which he certainly is ; and it is impossible for him not to see that the Court also are ina very delicate situation; because, as to ourselves, if the adjournment is to take place, every body knows that there is no reason why we should be kept in this house ; we may go to our respective homes; at the same tine, there never has Leen an instance of a jury separating, and going away in the manner that is now etapa. Tcontess I think that there may be very serious consequences from it, As to the necessity, I think nobody can resist it; itis evident that the trial must go to such a length, that it cannot be proceeded upon safely without some sort of an adjournment of that kind: but I do foresee very serious difficulties hereafter, as well as pethaps in this very case, in gentlemen going home, and separating themselves. It is a very delicate and unpleasant situation to be pblized to say to gentlemen that they must be kept here all night; but really, if I am forced to speak, I think that they ought not to separate. 
BULLER 1012 Here is an alderman who remembers the trial of Bet Canning ; he informs me that, to his knowledge, the jury went home during that trial. 
NEWMAN 1013 I remember it perfectly well; I spent the evening with one of the jury. 
EYRE 1014 Do you think you are able to go on all night? if you do go on all night we shall make but a certain progress, and I am afraid we shall be in no condition to pursue our business to-morrow. 
BULLER 1015 I understand the shetiffs have beds prepared here for allthe jury. 
EAMER 1016 There are beds and Mattrasses prepared. 
EYRE 1017 The rule of law is clear beyond all doubt; at the same time, the necessity of public justice arises distinctl. and visibly, and is felt by all mankind: i my apprehension, that will justify a departure from the strict rule, but it will only justify that departure as far as the necessity goes, and there the difficulty is: but, to be sure, if the jury can be accommodated, and can have that refreshment which is necessary to go on, without separating, then the necessity have been speaking of does not carry them through the whole case of being allowed to separate. As there is nu doubt in any body’s mind about it, we must‘desire the sheritls to give the jury all the accommodation they can furnish them with, and we must desire of them to submit to a difficulty which I am very sorry is imposed upon them, but which I do not see any means of avoiding. Bailiffs must be sworn to attend the jury. The counsel for the prisoner will observe, that the recorg mutt be made up as of the first day of the trial. 
ERSKINE 1018 Be it so, in the most em phatical way, for the purposes of Jaw and justice. 
ERSKINE 1019 My lord, all this immense body of papers has been seized, and been a long time in the hands of the officers of the crown—We applied to see them, but were refused—we applied to the privy council, and were refused—we were referred to your lordship, because they knew your lordship could not grant such arequest—we are therefore here with all these papers tumbled upon our heads, without the least opportunity of examining them, and yet from this mass of papers, which the attorney general took nine hours to read, the act of compassing the king's death is to be collected. From a view of the whole, I trust your lordships will be disposed to indulge me—indeed I shall expect, in justice to the prisoner, that I may have an opportunity, betore I address the jury upon this mass of evidence, to know what is in it, because your lordships must very well know that, though taking all the pains I can to look at it as itisread, yet itis quite impossible for the human mind to take it in, or form any idea of it, without an hour- or two at least (for Ishould not require more) to take it into consideration. When I look across the table, and see I am addressing myself te hon. gentlemen of the profession, who know the situation I am in, I canmot doubt their consent—and the reason I mention it now is, that there may not be any inconvenience to your lordship in praying this upon the sudden. 
EYRE 1020 We. shall certainly be disposed to give the counsel for the prisoner all reasonable opportunity to make the best defence the nature of the case is capable of. I observe the greater number of papers that have been read, and the most important as yet, are papers that are printed, and before us, therefore, there can be no difficulty as to them, for I have no doubt that the printed papers have been very well considered—To-morrow we shall see what the papers will be; if there are any which appear to us, or shall appear to you, to be papers that require a careful casting your eye over before you prepare for your defence, I shall certainly propose to the Sour that you su have a reasonable opportunity for so loing. 
MACDONALD 1021 With resi to the complaint of the privy council, there is no instance, I believe, of their ever suffering such a communication, 
ERSKINE 1022 I am not complaining of the privy council, we were referred by the privy council to the crown, and by the crown to your lordship. 
EYRE 1023 I do not think it possible for the Court to have interfered upon any ground. It is one thing to permit the prisoner to see the evidence that is to be made use of against him, and it is another thing, if it should so happen, that in the seizing of his papers, there arg papers not fit to be made use of against him, but that are necessary for his defence, that such papers should have been seen; in that case, I apprehend that upon an application to the privy council or the secretary of state, that they would do what public justice requires—order access to such pas pers. The papers which are to be produced y the prosecutor, a prisoner never has by law, nor ought to have an opportunity of examine ing till they are produced in evidence. Papers that are not necessary for the prosecution, ut necessary for his defence, come under a very different predicament, and I think the rule held upon them would be very different, 
LAW 1024 The papers in the case of Mr. Sayre had been seized, and the chief justice said, give notice of the papers you. want,. and move for them. 
EYRE 1025 If you asked to look at those papers which were intended to be produced against you, I do not think that was right. 
GIBBS 1026 We asked to look at that book, that we might see what papers were necessary for our defence. 
EYRE 1027 I believe we had better not discuss the thing now. 
GURNELL 1028 I found this letter among the prisoner's papers. 
GURNELL 1029 London, the 5th Octr. 1793. 
GURNELL 1030 “ Dear Sir ; With pleasure I peruse your favour of the 2d inst. but as yet have seen nor heard nothing of the two copies of Mr. Muir’s trial, which you mention as being sent to the society and myself; be kind enough, notwithstanding, to return that gentleman thanks for his polite attention, and assure him, that we view him in the light of a martyr to freedom as well as Mr. Palmer, and that our warmest hopes are, that the oppressors of mankind will either be ashamed or afraid of carrying their revengeful malice into execution. he general convention which you mention, appears to Mr. Margarot (to whom alone I have communicated your letter) and myself, to be a very excellent measure; and as such, I could wish Sieg witKout delay to communicate it officially to our society, without any “ways mentioning that you had written to me privately. If, in your official letter, you should Tequire of us to send a deputation to that meeting, I have no doubt ‘but our society would with pleasure accept the invitation ; and I am persuaded it would do much good. Our freedom, as you justly observe, depends entirely upon ourselves, and upon our availing ourselves of this opportunity, which, once Jost, may not besoon recovered. Iam glad to discover by your testimony, that 1 was not mistaken in the high opinion I always had of lord Daer’s patriotism; a title may be a bar to disinterested patriotism, but it seems, he has evinced it not to be an insuperable one. 
GURNELL 1031 “You are right; it is true, that we have had another general meeting, at which a hastily composed, and suddenly ‘produced address to the king was read, applauded, and agreed to be presented, but on a cool revisal, the said address being found ‘to be more illnatured than spirited, more dangerous in its language than advantageous in its object, besides being too long, the committee, with the approbation of the society, have adopted another, much safer, more apposite, and relating solely to the war—inclosed you have a copy of it. But you was misinformed, when you was told we passed any resolution at that meeting, for we only came to one, and that tather of a private nature, namely, that the conduct of sir James Saunderson in preventing the meeting of the London Corresponding Society at the Globe tavern, Fleet-street, was vf such a nature as to place him below eur censure

WOOD 1040 “ Brother Hardy; The letter and this paper will explain themselves. I was at a meeting on the day this mentions, and the determination of the association are universal suffrages and annual parliaments, and it was tbe unanimous desire and wish of that meeting, that two persons, if possible, should be sent from our society in England, as delegates, to meet our dear northern frends in the ensuing convention. I must earnestly desire the said wish of our friends here may be complied with, as it will add to the dignity of our association in particular, and to the convention in general, and will further the common cause much, ina way the Judgment of our association must hit upon, without any explanation of mine. If any person could be elected of sound principles, a clear understanding speaker, with a long head and a good warm heart in ‘the cause of freedom, having it in view, and not his own aggrandizement, such a delegate would be of great service. If sucky a one is chosen, he must be here by the twenty-ninth day of this month, as the convention meets on that day; and if my poor feeble efforts will be of any service to the convention as the other delegate, the London Corresponding Society may command me for the support of their interests as far as lam capable; but those of you who know me, know I am no speaker, much less an orator, but this I will say, my heart lies in the right pare and hates and abhors all despots, lease to communicate this to our friends, and let me know the society’s determination, if they will honour me with their confidence. I am often with our friend Muir; he bears his confinement with a fortitude of soul, inspired with the genius of liberty; he is well. I have much to say, but I must leave off. This letter will be delivered by my servant, which must have a speedy answer, because of. the approaching meeting here. Every thing. of moment I will communicate to you from time to time; and wishing destruction to all human butchers, and success to all friends of liberty, I remain, brother Hardy, yours to command, A.

That part of your letter which mentions your visiting different towns in Scotland, for the purpose of promoting the cause, they were leased with the idea, but they thought that it could not be put in practice on account of the necessary supplies, which come in but very sluwly. It is to be mentioned in the different divisions. We have elected J. Baxter (by ballot) as chairman of the committee for the remainder of the quarter. We have also appointed a committee of constitution, Separate from the committee of delegates; one member is chosen from each division, to meet on this night for the first time, and to be totally unconnected with the committee of delegates. We still increase in number, and the address to the king to put an end to the war is ordered to be advertised to receive signatures in the Courier, Chronicle, Eyres’s Sunday Gazette; afterwards by hand-bills, &c. We have opened a correspondence with a new society at Bristol. I have to inform you of the wish of the society that you would favour them with the number of delegates in the convention, and the number from England also, and how the civil and military power relishes your meeting; and that you would send al a report from the convention as might appear in the newspapers in London. Send me an Edinburgh Gazetteer when there is any thing in it of importance. I would have sent you a Courier, but they informed me that they sent several to the coffee- houses and taverns in Edinburgh; for that reason, I thought it unnecessary.

SCOTT 1099 Afterwards, the correspondence was taken into consideration, Your official letter was read, and much approved of, and copies of jt taken for the use of the different divisions. It seems to be the gencral wish of the different divisions of the society for you to continue as long as you can be of real use to the cause ; but it wholly depends upon the thing necessary, money. We have hit upon an exe pedient, which we mean to put in practice in two or three days, that promises fair to bring in a considerable revenue. I shall inform you of it in my next. Those whom you gave directions to call upon has fallen far short of that liberality which youexpected. Thecommittee last night gave me orders to transmit to you twelve guineas; I enclose you a draft on sir William Forbes, and Co. for that sum. Next week I hope to be able tosend you more. There was another report of Mr. Frost being’ to be pilloried on last Tuesday and Wednesday; but it happened that, on Wednesday, a Charles Leslie stood in the pillory at Charing-cross for a crime shocking to mention, Mr. Frost is not very well at present.

The reason why Mr. Yorke did not go from that society was, that he wrote a letter to them, informin them that he would not go unless they “old pay him the whole of the money down. I have only given you a summary account of our proceedings; but you know how I am situated both in the day and in the evenings, that I cannot command a quarter of an hour to myself; therefore I hope you will excuse me for being so laconic. I have made the situation of Mr. Muir as public as I could; it throws a damp upon the spirits of every friend to humanity who hears of his cruel treatment. I remain your fellow-labourer in the good cause.

SCOTT 1104 Jetters of the 12th and 28th instant, which I laid before the committee last night. After reading and deliberating upon them maturely, they resolved that you should continue at your post till you hear from me officially after the next meeting of the general committee of delegates; by that time we may form some idea what success we are likely to meet with from the advertisement and circular letter. We entertained high hopes of beSng liberally assisted by the friends of freedom. A circular letter was ordered to be drawn up, to be sent to the different societies in England with whom we correspond, in‘viting them to send delegates to the convention in Scotland, to promote a reform in pardiament. A standing committee of five is appointed to answer the correspondence during your mission inScotland. Your objection ’ to forming a new constitution in your absence was not by them reckoned valid: it is very possible that it will not be accepted before your return; for it will be maturcly investigated by all the divisions of the society before at is fully agreed to: besides, it cannot affect you in your present mission, for you well now that we are not very fond of ex post facto law, You will herewith receive a draught for 12. 12s. Od. on sir William Forbes and Uo. The Englishman’s Rights I avill send you a few, with a few other tracts. We have not near enough fur the orders we have from the country, and our own addresses are nearly out of print. I shall direct them to the person to whom I address your letters.

We are highly pleased with the proposed union with our northern brethren, and beg you will use every exertion in your power to establish that desirable union wpon a firm and permanent basis. it gives us great pleasure and encouragement to hear that the spirit of liberty is so flourishing in the north, and are happy to inform you that the same noble spirit is making a rapid: proess in the south.

GURNELL 1112 “ Edinburgh, Tuesday, Dec. 2, 1793. 
GURNELL 1113 “ Citizen Hardy, We received last night a letter signed by you, but written by another Person, acquainting us with the determination of the committee, ‘ that at the adjournmentof the convention, we should return imme‘diately toLondon.’ This determination we will undoubtedly conform unto, unless it be (as we hope ad trust it will) contradicted in your next ; for, if the committee abides by it, we who, by being on the spot and thoroughly ac alm with the state of the country, cam judge with certainty thereon—do assure you that our immediate return to London will be attended with very bad consequences; for at present all the country societies look up to us to come among them, to enliven, to encourage them, to convince them by our presence that we exist, that we have been sent from England for the purposes of union and reform, and that the time is near at hand when such reform must take place. Nothing, dear friends, must force us from Scotland at pees but the absolute impossibility of earing the expenses attending our mission, and those expenses may be somewhat lessened by recalling one of us and leayimg the other; our Norwich friends may likewise bear a part of them; so that, unless the funds of the socicty are very low indeed, no excuse for recall can be valid, unless founded on fear, and that we must remind you, is our concern and not yours. While, therefore, the idea of uniting our society with the whole kingdom of Scotland affords you a pleasing prospect, let us do every thing in our power to cement that union; and this can only be done by a longer residence in the country, and by visiting the several societies which have sent delegates to Edinburgh, and would think themselves ill-used if we did not take theit town in our way. Consider of it then, we beseech you, and let us have your answer immediately.. 
GURNELL 1114 “ The convention proceed with great spirit; we sit daily: and last week we came toa resolution, which we fancy will give pleasure to every fricnd to reform: as the minutes are to be printed, we will, at present, only give you the heads of it, viz. aan 
GURNELL 1115 “ That should any attempt be made by guvernment for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus bil, the introduction of a convention bill, or the landing of foreign troops in Great Britain or Ireland, the delegates are inmediately to assemble in convention at a certain place, the appointment of which is left with a secret committee. That, when seven delegates shall be thus assembled, they shall declare themselves permanent; and, when their number amounts to twenty-one, they shall proceed to business: thus you see we are providing against what may happen. 
GURNELL 1116 “ Citizen Gerrald’s health ts so far recovered as to not prevent him from fully attending his duty. We cannot say as much of citizen Sinclair, from the Society for Constitutional Information; he has been confined to his bed ever since Saturday by a violent fever and sore throat: he is, however, somewhat better this morning. He is a valuable oung man; and should he die, his loss would ts severely felt; not indeed by his constituents, who have basely abandoned him, but by all the friends of freedom. He is a member of our society, and we recommend him to your notice. 
GURNELL 1117 “ You will before this have received our est, of the 26th November, acknowledging the receipt of your letter of the 23rd, together with a remittance of 12. 12s. Od. Our time is so constantly employed that we find it absolutely impossible as yet to write to you more than once a week, and even that on no fixed day; eighteen hours out of the four-andtwenty are devoted to public business, and you may rest assured they are not misspent. We are happy to hear that you go on as well in the south as we do in the north. Letters convey but very imperfectly, and with no great degree of safety, what we might wish to inform each other of. You have done us a material injury by neglecting to send us a parcel of our publications, and a number of copies of the Juryman’s Rights ; pray do not delay them any longer, and among them some of the letters to Dundas.

GURNELL 1121 Addressed—“ Mr. Thomas Hardy. 
EYRE 1122 Were these papers found in the same manner as the other papers 
SCOTT 1123 They were. 
BOWER 1124 These are the proceedings of the convention. 
ERSKINE 1125 I confess I am not veryanxious to shut out any evidence. I very probably do not understand it; but I do not see how it bears upon the case. As the case stands at present, the evidence is this. This society was formed, the object of its formation has been read in evidence, subject to such construction as the gentlemen of the jury upon their oaths shall be disposed to put upon it, in connexion with all the rest of the evidence. They appoint two delegates to attend this Edinburgh Convention, and your lordships will have the goodness also to recollect, that the holding of that convention is not an act which is charged at all upon this record ; but the conspiracy, as it is called, was to assem-. ble another convention at a very distant period after this first convention bad been ds persed. 
ERSKINE 1126 We had it in evidence recently, we have all heard within these five minutes that those two gentlemen who were appointed as delegates to represent the Corresponding Society, of which the gentleman at the bar was secretary, had instructions given them, which instructions directed these delegates to pursue closcly those rulcs and institutions of the society which have been read in evidence. Therefore, my lord, if they have—I do not know that they have, nor do I care whether they have or no—if it should turn out in the proceedings that are now proposed to be read, that this convention at Edinburgh did, in the moments of heat and irritation, which I take for granted always must belong to persons in the situation in which they were placed— if they had written, or said, or done any ba nay, I will go farther, if Mr. Margarot has done any ing, or said any thing, not within the scope of the instructions given to him, which instructions have been read in evidence, and which instructions refer also to the institution of the society, which has been also read in evidence, I-humbly contend that cannot affect the prisoner in any myself and, give me leave for a moment to call this to the serious consideration of the Court. 
ERSKINE 1127 The defendant is charged with no act of the Edinburgh Convention ; no, he is charged with that of which if I could believe him one moment in my mind to be guilty, although I must stand here to do my duty towards him, yet I should do it in another fashion than I mean to perform it—he is charged with com-. passing and imagining the death of our sovereign lord the king, whose life is dear, my lord, toall the kingdom ; in order to prove that he had from the beginning that wicked intention, for that wicked intention is the foundation of the whole procecding, and no act can be given in evidence before your lordships, nor will I sit here silent to hear any act given in evidence that does not go to show the prisoner at the bar had that wicked compassing. Ladmit that, if they can show that any instructions were given to these two men, which instructions carry upon the face of them (and whether thev carry it upon the face of them or no is subject to the consideration that they are to receive from the jury) evidence of that wicked intention, or that that intention: can be proved by any thing that is like inference or construction (for this is not an extension of the statute at all) this is matter of evidence. 
ERSKINE 1128 My friend Mr. Gibbs and myself have sat silent; your lurdships, I am sure, must agree that we have given no sort of trouble to the Court, nor do I mean in the progress of the cause to give trouble to the Court; when, therefore, they read any thing that comes from Mr. Hardy, or any thing that does not come from him, though he is the mere instrument, as the secretary of a body of men, yetif he mixes in it, we have never objected to itas evidence ; but when they propose to read, I 
ERSKINE 1129 do not know what it is—probably I am wast-
ERSKINE 1130 ing my own breath and your lordship’s time in opposing that which will be of no consequence, pethaps, when it comes to be read ; but when I stand here defending this man, who holds his life under the law, and I am not defending his life only, but my uwn life, and the life of every man in the country, I must take care that the rules of evidence are observed—I wish to know the nature and the ality of the paper. If it be something Mr. Hardy is cognizant of, if they can show that the proceedings of the convention were known to and approved of by Mr. Hardy, my objection falls to the ground, and I have nothing to say about them. 
EYRE 1131 I take it for granted they mean to do that, because, otherwise, the proceedings of the convention at Edinburgh can be nothing in this cause. 
BOWER 1132 There are subsequent approbations of them without end; we shall read evidence enough of that by and by. 
EYRE 1133 There is enough, in my opinion, to let in the evidence; the application of it is quite another censideration: this is the act of a body, to which this prisoner sent persons to act in his name; he may afterwards to be sure object that they exceeded their commission, and therefore they are personally responsible; but I think that will be observation upon the evidence, it is no objection to the evidence. 
ERSKINE 1134 I am perfectly satisfied ; I only wanted to know what we were about. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1135  Mr. Skirving must be considered as agent to the society, and it is extremely important, as it seems to me. 
EYRE 1136 It is agreed to be read, subject to the observations that may arise upon it. tion were ordered to stand last on their Minutes, but which, in fact, had never been incorporated into the original document. The “ Declaration and Resolutions will be found in the indictment 885.] . 
GURNELL 1137 I found these papers in the prisoner’s house. 
GURNELL 1138 “ Edinburgh, Dec. 8, 1793. 
GURNELL 1139 “ Fellow Citizens, We desire that a copy of the inclosed papers be kept by the society, and that another copy of them be delive without delay to citizen Martin, in order that he may proceed thereupon immediately. 
GURNELL 1140 “ You willalready have had confused accounts of what has taken place here for the last four days, but on T uieslay next the Edinburgh Gazetteer shall (if despotism permit} give you a complete detail of every thing; the society will thereby be able to discover, that our arrival in Scotland has been productive of great advantage to the cause, and at the same time has given great alarm to our enemies. We are very much surprised at the remissness of the society, while we are exposing our life and liberty, while we are devoting our time and our exertions to their service, while we are incurring numberlessexpenses, and affronting dangers which would stagger the most Hardy of them; while we are doin: all this, we are moreover obliged to remind them of it, and that supplies are now become more necessary than ever. Surely the pecuniary exertions of any individual in the society can never be compared to our endeavours; honoured with their confidence, we find ourselves happy in being placed in the front of the battle ; but let them remember that our sacrificing ourselves will be of little use, unless they afford us a proper support, and that most immediately. Not daring any longer to trust to the post, we send you all these papers in a parcel ; you will be so guod as to make us acquainted with their safe arrival. Gerrald wishes to get to London as soon as possible: he will communicate that which cannot be so fully expressed by letter; you may consider this as a private letter, but you may read such parts of it, as you think proper, to any member of the society, especially where it may be productive of good. You will see by the inclosed papers, that power has proceeded in a most arbitrary manner; almost all the prominent characters in the convention have been, or are to be apprehended and examined. Lord Daer will, we believe, meet with no greater favour than ourselves ; we understand that there is a warrant out against him. As an account of what has happened to us would exceed the bounds of a letter, we will only just give you a sketch of it, by way of journal, referring you as we said before, to next Tuesday’s Gazetteer. 
GURNELL 1141 s Thursday morning at seven o'clock, a sheriff's officer, followed by five other men, entered our bed-room, informed us he had a warrant (which, however, he refused to show) for apprehending us, and scizing our papers. We remained confined all day; at night we were examined and admitted to bail, each in the sum of two thousand merks. 
GURNELL 1142 “ Friday morning, at nine o'clock, we were sent for again without a warrant, for the pur-pose of being present at the opening of al small trunk, containing our popes ; but M. ML protesting against the i legality of the whole of the proceedings, and refusing to give up the key, the sheriff substitute and the procurator fiscal dared to proceed no farther in the business. 
GURNELL 1143 “ Saturday morning, at nine o’clock, two messengers came again into our room with Gerrald; they left a summons to appear at ten o’clock with M. M.; they left nothing but a request to accompany Gerrald to the office, yet when arrived there, he found that a warrant was issued against him, for the purpose of detaining him a prisoner. While the box was opened, and the papers examined, M. M. still persisting in his refusal, the ke was forced from him, the trunk was opened, the papers examined, and rae restored; the other part was kept, and a declaration drawn up which he was required to sign, but refused, otesting against the whole of the business. 
GURNELL 1144 errald, however, signed what was drawn up in his name, and we were once more liberated ; and since then, now already twentyfour hours, no further persecution bas been commenced against us; but while we, as individuals, were thus harassed, (Thursday) the whole of the convention were equally ill used; many of them were taken into custody, and when the remainder met as usual, the provost, attended by his myrmidons, went, and after pulling Matthew Campbell Browne, of Sheffield, out of the chair, ordered the convention to disperse, and informed them that he would allow no such meetings in future. (Friday) the next day, the convention having agreed to meet at another place, out of the jurisdiction of the provost; we not tear long assembled before the sheriff, with his myrmidons, appeared among us, and com-manded us to depart; after having asked! whether that meeting was the British Con-vention, and being answered in the affirmative, he next i oes who was president, upon which M. M. having openly asked, andobtained leave of the convention, placed him- ; self in the chair; informed the sheriff that he 
GURNELL 1145 M. M. was then president of the British Con vention, and that he would not break up the meeting unless unconstitutionally forced thereunto by the sheriff's pulling him out of the chair; which the latter (after some little hesitation) having complied with, the ex-president (Gerrald) was also put into the chair, which he would not leave but by being pulled out ; adjourned the convention to the place where it was to become permanent in ils sitting, and having called upon his colleague Gerrald, for to close the meeting with prayer, the company departed peaceably, but not without various reflections on the proceedings, and those reflections not confined merely to the members of the convention, but coming also from the crowd without doors, and even from the attending constables. The next day a [esaresion was issued by the pores forbidding all assembling within the imits of his jurisdiction. We know not what will happen, but we venture to predict that all this persecution will increase rather than diminish the ardour of the people for reform. The country societies hearing of this, are hourly pouring in fresh delegates. Want of paper forbids my writing any more
SCOTT 1146 Adieu, yours, M. M. “ Edinburgh, December 19, 1793. 
GURNELL 1147 “ Fellow Citizens, It is impossible for us to find time to write you as we ought; every instant we are injgrrupted, or rather the house is not free from visitors from early hour until twelve at night, and we have besides sucha variety of business upon our hands that we can scarcely make any progress. However, as Sinclair, the delegate of the Society for Constitutional Information, will arrive in town as soon as this letter, he will be able to give you an accurate verbal detail of all the infamous proceedings which have taken place here—of the progress of reform, and of the plans for future operations. My colleague Gerrald also proposes to leave this place the latter end of this, or the beginning of next week. He will explain himself to you. Pray send him money for his journey, &c. He is now gone to Perth on very urgent business. Excuse me from entering into any detail at resent. We have to acknowledge your two jast letters; they came safe, but slow, being delivered only five days after their date, where the delay originated we cannot tell— your first gave us a draft for twelve guineas ; and your second enclosed a ten pound note, both very acceptable ; but we are sorry toadd, that they do not clear our expenses. Expenses which are no ways owing to extravagancy but to absolute necessity, and are extremely profitable to the cause itself. We well know how heavy the burthen is un the society; and we grieve that our former sacrifices shoukl have left us little else to offer other than our personal exertions, We feel as we ought the approbation you bestow on our conduct; and we flatter ourselves, that our future behaviour will give you no reason to think your praise prematurely bestowed. Since Sinclair’s departure nothing new has occurred, excepting the formation of a society some where about the Grampion Hills; they have already got the intelligence that the convention mean to enlighten the Highlands; and they testify their gratitude for our remembrance and our exertions, and have already madc a subscription towards it

GURNELL 1160 Citizen Adams, sccretary to the Socicty for Constitutional Information. 
GURNELL 1161 “ London, January 11th, 1794. Fellow Citizens, I have just received a letter from citizen Margarot at Edinburgh, with some of the Edinburgh Gazettcers, where you will see that citizen Skirving is found guilty, and sentenced for fourteen years transportation to Botany Bay. Margarot’s trial comes nest, he meets it with great firmness andresolution. I have no time to make my comments on the proceedings, but I think our opponents are cutting their own throats as fastas they can. Now is the time for us to do something worthy of men, the brave detenders of liberty, south ef the English channel, are performing wonders, driving their enemies Plone them like chatf befure the whirlwind. Margarot tells me that he has Not time to write to you just now, but he hopes to have time very soon, when his trial is over, and immured ina prison. The London Corresponding Society is to have a general meeting, and an anniversary dinner on Monday the 20th instant at the Globe tavern, Strand. I have sent you some of Margarot’s and Skirving’s indictment, with two copies of a pamphleton brewing; heis a member of our society, the author; it you approve of it, you may put it in practice, and be a great saving to many families, also a diminution of the revenue, for every one brewing their own beer pay no duty for it, excuse haste ; I still remain, 
GARROW 1162 I believe you are a printer by business— Yes. Were you employed at any time to print a number of these papers
SCOTT 1163 Yes. 
GARROW 1164 When were you employed
SCOTT 1165 I believe it was the 20th of February last. 
GARROW 1166 By whom were you employed
SCOTT 1167 Thelwall brought me the manuscript. 3 
GARROW 1168 Was any body with him when he came with it
SCOTT 1169 Yes, there was, but I do not recollect who. 
GARROW 1170 Were there more persons than one
SCOTT 1171 No. 
GARROW 1172 What orders did he give F ia respecting it
SCOTT 1173 Hedesired me to print o} 
ERSKINE 1174 Is this evidence? 
GARROW 1175 We submit that it is. 
ERSKINE 1176 Then I object to it, what Mr. Thelwall said is no evidence against Mr. Hardy. 
GARROW 1177  submit to your lordsbtp that it is the clearest evidence in the wor after that which your lordships and the jury have already heard. We have proved, by a great variety of evidence, much of it under the hand and signature of the prisoner now at id lordship’s bar, much by papers found in is custody at the time of his apprehension, a clear connexion and conspiracy upon the subject of this high treason between Mir. Thelwall and the prisoner. We therefore submit to your lordships with confidence, but with deference undoubtedly, that all the acts of Mr. Thelwall, or any other person against whom we have given evidence, fitto be submitted to the jury of their accession to the peneral plan of the conspiracy, is clearly evidence against every man charged with that conspiracy ; this therefore is an act of Mr. Thelwall’s ; it is hardly worth discussing in this instance, only that it is as well to do it the first time that the objection arises; but we have other evidence, such as the defendant’s paying for the printing; but having given evidence of Thelwall and Hardy being parties to the neral conspiracy alleged as high treason, we have a right to give in evidence any acts of these conspirators relative to that object against any of them. 
ERSKINE 1178 There is no manner of doubt that upon an indictment for a conspiracy, be the conspiracy to do one act, or another act, or be the quality of the act done, when it is done, what it may, that as far as you can connect persons acting together towards one purpuse, which purpose constitutes the crime, you may undoubtedly involve them together by evidence, but that is not the question here. I wish to be understood that I have no anxiety li the subject, because it isa printed paper which has been in all our hands, and was yesterday stated at great length by Mr. Attorney General in the course of his opening ; but it is only that the proceedings may not be embarrassed in the course of them that makes me interpose. 
ERSKINE 1179 Mr. Thelwall gives a paper to this witness to be printed, if my friend Mr. Garrow can show that Mr. Hardy afterwards paid for the printing of this paper, then this will be so much time lost; but if that is not before your Lordships, as it is not, there may be a ditference in the quality of the act, by the procceding farther to the printing a paper; for instance, suppose this paper itself contained something criminal, could your lordships fasten that crime upon the prisoner, by Mr. Thelwall’s having directed this gentleman to print it? the knowing that a paper is printing, and giving an authority to print it is different; supposing that paper contained treason in itiat hich I know it does not, that might be saa prea of treason, but could not be treason itself, therefore I humbly apprehend that in a criminal case of this enormous size your lordsbips will not stretch the rules of evidence, so as to allow it to be asked of this witness, whether Mr. Thelwall did direct him (the prisoner, Mr. Hardy, not being present) to print that paper, the nature of which I do not know. 
EYRE 1180 That is what I was going to observe, the insisting on one ide, and objecting on the other, is perfectly Premature, for not knowing what the contents of the paper are, the Court cannot judge whether it is a branch of the evidence of the general conspiracy, or something personal with which the prisoner has nothing to do. 
GARROW 1181 I take the liberty of stating to the Court, that the ground and foundation upon which I humbly submit to read this Paper is, that it is an instrument to carry into lect the general high treason charged in this indictment. One stage or step of the conspiracy being a paper to excite the subjects of this country to desert their allegiance, and in defiance of that allegiance to set about to call a convention by force to assume the power of the legislature. It is as an instrument and a paper to carry that into effect that we desire to read it. 
ERSKINE 1182 Is your lordship to take that from Mr. Garrow’s assertion? 
EYRE 1183 tIt is necessary in order for the Court to judge whether it is of the tendency you describe, to open to us tbat part of the paper which you say has that tendency. I have cast my eye over the paper, and I see that there is a passage in it which does go to the general object. 
GIBBS 1184 I understand the point that Mr. Garrow contends is this, that though Mr. Hardy only is now upon trial, yet because one overt act laid in the indictment is, that papers were published, that for the purpose of proving that overt act, part of a paper deivered by Mr. Thelwall to be printed is to be given in evidence against Mr. Hardy. 
GARROW 1185 I shall not by any ingenuity of my friend be drawn into the argument of an abstract question, I forbore to state the paper, lest it might be said I was giving the effect of it; I will now state the passage which I say demonstrates that it is of that quality, “You may ask, perhaps, by what means shall we seek redress? We answer, that men in a state of civilized society are bound to seek redress of the grievances from the laws as long as any redress can be obtained by the laws. But our common Master whom we serve (whose law is a law of liberty, and whose service is perfect freedom) has taught us not to expect to gather grapes from thorns, nor figs from thistles, We must have redress from our own laws, and not from the laws of our plunderers, enemies, and oppressors. There is no redress tor a nation circumstanced as we are, but ina fair, free, and full representation of the people. 
GARROW 1186 Now we allege and humbly insist that we have given much evidence to show that the purpose of this conspiracy, which is charged to be high treason, was, by force to assume the power of legislation, in despite of the constituted authorities of the country, as they at present happily exist here, by substituting a convention of the people. 
ERSKINE 1187 Our objection is merely with regard to this coming trom Mr. Thelwall ; your lordship will dispose of it as you please, I have no anxiety about it. 
EYRE 1188 This purports to be a paper containing a resolution at a general meeting of the London Corresponding Society, held at the Globe tavern; it is brought to the printer by one of the members of that society, the prisoner being another member of that society, acting in that society as the secretary; then they being both involved therefore in the proceedings of that society, and this being a printed paper produced by one of them, it does seem to me that in a general charge of a conspiracy this is evidence to prove a circumstance in that conspiracy : whether it will be ultimately so brought home to the prisoner, Hardy, as that he should be responsible for the guilt of having published it, may be another consideration, but that it is a branch of the conspiracy, and a circumstance occurring in it, the import of the paper plainly proves. It does seem to me, theretore, that it is admissible. 
GARROW 1189 What directions did Mr. Thelwall give you when he brought you the manuecript for the purpose of printing 
SCOTT 1190 H e told mc to print off two thousand and then stop. 
GARROW 1191 What were you to do with the two thousand when you had printed them? ; 
GIBBS 1192 Does your lordship think that all the directions which Mr. Thelwall gave, are to be received inevidence? 
EYRE 1193 Whether it is two thousand, or what number, cannot be material, it is the publication of an act of this society. 
ERSKINE 1194 Your lordship means that it will have an application toevery member of the Corresponding Society. 
EYRE 1195 It applies to the society, as far as relates to the general transactions of that society, but as far as it may constitute individual guilt, which may be separated from the general guilt of the parties to the general plan, that is another consideration. 
GARROW 1196 Did you print the number ordered 
SCOTT 1197  Not that day. 
GARROW 1198 How soon did you print them 
SCOTT 1199 Iprinted two hundred of them that day, and carried them to the Globe tavern; when I went to the Globe tavern I met Mr. Hardy on the stairs. 
GARROW 1200 Did you know him before 
SCOTT 1201 Yes. 
GARROW 1202 Were you a member of the society yourself
SCOTT 1203 Yes. 
GARROW 1204 You had then probably been present at some of the meetings of the society
SCOTT 1205 I was not at that meeting. 
GARROW 1206 Had you been present at any meetings of the society before you met Mr. Hardy upon the stairs at the Globe tavern 
SCOTT 1207 Not some time. 
GARROW 1208 Had you ever seen him there 
SCOTT 1209 Yes. 
GARROW 1210 In what character did he act at the meetings ? In the character of secretary. 
GARROW 1211 What passed when you met him on the stairs
SCOTT 1212 I told him I had brought two hundred copie of the resolutions; he desired me to take them back again, and not distribute one of them; accordingly I went home with them, and returned again to the Globe tavern to dinner. 
GARROW 1213 You said February, do you mean February or January 
SCOTT 1214 I am not sure to the month. 
GARROW 1215 Was it on the day at which the resolutions were come to
SCOTT 1216 The day of the meeting. 
GARROW 1217 a what time of the day was it that you saw Mr. Thelwall when he brought you the copy 
SCOTT 1218 It was, I believe, between one and two o'clock. 
GARROW 1219 At what time was it that you carried the two hundred copies to the Globe tavern 
SCOTT 1220 Between four and five. 
GARROW 1221 You returned home with these two hundred by the direction of Mr. Hardy, and came back to the Globe tavern to dinner 
SCOTT 1222 Yes. 
GARROW 1223 At what time was that 
SCOTT 1224 At pretty nigh six o'clock. 
GARROW 1225 Were you present at the time these resolutions were proposed in the society
SCOTT 1226 No, I was not. 
GARROW 1227 Was it on the day upon which the resolutions purport by Mr. Thelwall’s paper to be come to, that you went to the Globe tavern, or amonth after 
SCOTT 1228 I had the copy on the am and delivered the two hundred on the 20th. 
GARROW 1229 Look at the paper, and tell us whether it was January or February; is the date correct 
SCOTT 1230 Yes. 
GARROW 1231 Then do you believe it was the 18th of January, and not the 18th of February, upon which you had the copy 
SCOTT 1232 Yes, I see now that it was January. 
GARROW 1233 Have you any doubt of that 
SCOTT 1234 None. 
GARROW 1235 When you returned again, was it to a private dinner or a public dinner of the society 
SCOTT 1236 A public dinner, every one paid for- his ticket. 
GARROW 1237 Was there any chairman at the dinner? did you see any person in the chair
SCOTT 1238 I am not very sure, I think Mr. ‘Thelwall was in the chair, but I am not sure. 
GARROW 1239 Was Mr. Hardy there 
SCOTT 1240 Yes, he was. 
GARROW 1241 When you returned to dinner, did you carry any copies of the paper you had printed with you 
SCOTT 1242 No, F did not. 
GARROW 1243 What did you do with these copies afterwards 
SCOTT 1244 Somebody was sent for them to my house. 
GARROW 1245 Where from 
SCOTT 1246 Frum the Globe tavern. 
GARROW 1247 From the meeting 
SCOTT 1248 Yes. 
GARROW 1249 Were they brought to the meeting
SCOTT 1250 They were. 
GARROW 1251 What was done with them there
SCOTT 1252 I saw only one of them. 
GARROW 1253 Where did youseethat? — Somebody handed it round the table, I am sure I do not krow who it was. 
GARROW 1254 How many persons might there be assembled at that meeting 
SCOTT 1255 I dare say there were about three hundred or thereabouts, as near. as I could guess. 
GARROW 1256 How late did you stay 
SCOTT 1257 Till ten o'clock, or thereabouts. 
GARROW 1258 Did you print any more of them at any time 
SCOTT 1259 Yes. 
GARROW 1260 When
SCOTT 1261 I cannot be particular to the time, T printed in the course of that week, I believe, a thousand more. 
GARROW 1262 By whose order
SCOTT 1263 Mr. Thelwall’s order was to print two thousand; I completed the two thousand according to his original order. 
GARROW 1264 What did you do with them when you had printed them
SCOTT 1265 I carried a good many of them to Mr. Hardy’s. 
GARROW 1266 What did you do with the rest
SCOTT 1267 People came for some now and then. 
GARROW 1268 What people
SCOTT 1269 Some of the members of the London Corresponding Society came for them. 
GARROW 1270 And did you deliver them as they came for them 
SCOTT 1271 Yes, some asked for a dozen, or half a dozen or so, and I delivered them. 
GARROW 1272 Did you print any more than the two thousand which Mr. Thelwall originally ordered? 
GARROW 1273 —To the best of my recollection I printed six thousand more. 
GARROW 1274 By whose orders did you print them 
SCOTT 1275 TI believe Mr. Hardy gave me orders to go on with them till I should be desired to stop. 
GARROW 1276 Were you ever desired to stop, and when
SCOTT 1277 I was desired to stop, I believe, in the month of March. 
GARROW 1278 Did you go on printing them till the month of March 
SCOTT 1279 I fia now and then occasionally as they were wanted. 
GARROW 1280 How many thousand might you print in all 
SCOTT 1281 Eight thousand. 
GARROW 1282 Who paid you for them
SCOTT 1283 They are not paid for yet. 
GARROW 1284 On whose credit did you print them? did any body at any time promise to pay you for them 
SCOTT 1285 No. 
GARROW 1286 Had you any conversation with Mr. Hardy about being paid for them
SCOTT 1287 No, I had not, no farther than I put them down to the credit of the society. 
GARROW 1288 Who desired you to do that 
SCOTT 1289 He did not desire me; but he, as treasurer, was to receive the moncy, and see the debts of the society aid. Who was ?— Mr. Hardy. Did you make the society debtor for them? Yes, I did. Have you printed upon other occasions for the society ?—I have. Who paid you?—Mr. Hardy. 
GARROW 1290 “AT A GENERAL MEETING 
GARROW 1291 “ op THE« LONDON CORRESPONDING SOCIETY, “ Held at the Grose Tavern, Strand, “On MONDA Ythe on Day of JANUARY, “1794. 
GARROW 1292 “CITIZEN JOHN MARTIN, 1n THE CHAIR. 
GARROW 1293 he following Appress to the Prorte of Great Britain and Ireland, was read and agreed to. 
GARROW 1294 Cinzens, We find the nation involved im a war, by which, in the course of ONE Campaign, immense numbers of our countrymen have been slaughtered; a vast expense has been incurred, our Trade, Comterce and Manufactories, are almost de‘ stroyed, and many of our Manufacturers and Artists are ruined, and their families starving. o add to our affliction, we have reason to expect, that other taxes will soon be added to the intolerable load of imposts and impositions with which we are already overwhelmed; for the purpose of defraying the expenses which have been incurred, in a fruitless crusade, to re-establish the odious despotism of France. “When we contemplate the principles of this war, we confess ourselves to be umabke to approve of it, as a measure, either of justice or discretion; and if we are to form our calculation of the result, from what has already passed, we can only lock forward to defeat and the eternal disgrace of the British name. 
GARROW 1295 “ While we are thus engaged in an expensive and rumous and foreign war; our state at home is not less deplorable. 
GARROW 1296 “ We are every day told, by those persons who are interested in supporting the Corruption List, and an inmumerable Host of Sinecure Placemen, that the Constitution of England, is the perfection of human wisdom; that our laws (we should rather say, TaErr laws) are the perfection of justice; and that their Administration of those laws is so impartial and so ready, as to afford an equal remedy, both to the rich and to the poor; by means of which, we are said to be placed in a state of absolute freedom, and that our Rights and Liberties are so well secured to us as to render all invasion of them impossible. 
GARROW 1297 “ When we ask, how we enjoy these transcendant privileges; we are referred to MAGNA CHARTA, and the BILL of RIGHTS; and the glorious REVOLUTION in the ig 1688, is held out to us, as the bulwark of British liberty. 
GARROW 1298 “ Cit1zens; We have referred to Magna Charta, to the Bill of Rights, and to the Revolution, and we certainly do find that our ancestors did establish wise and wholesome laws: but we as certainly find, that, of the venerable Constitution of our ancestors, hardly a vestige remains. 
GARROW 1299 “ The only Chapters of the Great Charter, which are now in legal existence, are the 14th and 29th. 
GARROW 1300 he important provision of the 14th Chapter, runs thus: 
GARROW 1301 “A Freeman shall not be amerced for a smal! fault, but after the manner of the faut ; and for a great fault after the’ greatness thereof, saving to him his contenement ; and a Merchant likewise, saving to him his merchandize ; and any other’s villain than ours shall be likewise amerced, saving to him his wainage; And none of the said amerciaments shall be assessed, but by the oath of honest and lawful men of the Victnage.’ 
GARROW 1302 “ But by the usurped power of the judges, in assessing Fines (and what Fines !!) in the cases of Misdemeanor; this glorious Right of the Subject, of having these fines assessed by the Jury (the only possible protection from slavery and the vilest oppression), is unjustly fat infamously ravished from us. 
GARROW 1303 he provision of the 29th chapter, runs thus : 
GARROW 1304 “ «No Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his freehold, or liberties, or free customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any otherwise destroyed, nor we will not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land. We will sell to no man, we will not deny, or defer to any man, either justice or right.’ 
GARROW 1305 he various methods now in constant tice by which the benefits of this provision are totally defeated and destroyed, might induce us to suppose, that the GREAT CHARTER has been repealed ; if we did not assuredly know, that it is the fundamental basis of our constitution; which even the REAL representatives of the people (much less the miserable nominees of HELSTUNE and OLD SARUM) have not the right, nor (as we trust it will be found by experience) the POWER to repeal. Yet what do we find in practice? Unconstitutional and illegal INFORMATIONS EX OFFICIO, that 1s, the arbitrary will of the king's Attorney General, usurping the oflice of the ACCUSING Jury; and the interested oath of a vile common informer, with the judsment of as vile a common trading or pensioned justice, substituted in the room of our birthright, an impartial trial by our country. 
GARROW 1306 Add to this, that the exorbitant expense of judicial proceedings, the novel practice of arbitrarily and repeatedly annulling the vericts of Juries, and the dilatory practice of the courts, most openly and shamefully contradict the clause which forbids the denial, the delay, and the sale of justice, 
GARROW 1307 “ A man accused of Fetony (for which by the comnion law of England, his life and goods are forfeited) may be bailed on finding two sureties for forty pounds each; but upon a charge of MISDEMEANOUR by words only, bail to the amount of ONE. THOUSAND POUNDS has been demanded. 
GARROW 1308 “Upon conviction also, for such misdemeanour, enormous fines, long and cruel imprisonments unknown to our ancient laws, and unsanctioned by any new statutes, have of late (and but of late) been too frequently and too oppressively inflicted. And all this, although by this bill of rights it is declared, that ‘ excessive bail shall not be demanded, “nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.’ 
GARROW 1309 “ If we look to IRELAND we find that acknowledged privilege of the people, to meet for the support and protection of their rights and liberties, is attempted, by terror, to be taken away by a late infamous act of parliament: hilst titles of honour! No, but of dishonour, are lavished; and new sources of corruption opened, to gratify the greedy prostitution of those, who are the instruments of this oppression. 
GARROW 1310 “In SCOTLAND, the Wicked Hand of Power has been impudently exerted, without even the wretched formality of an act of Parliament, Magistrates have furcibly intruded into the peaceful and lawful meetings of Freemen; and, by force (not only without law, but against law), have, under colour of magisterial office, interrupted thcir deliberations, and prevented their association. 
GARROW 1311 he wisdom and good conduct of the 
GARROW 1312 BRITISH CONVENTION at Edinburgh, has been such, as to defy their bitterest enemies to name the law which they have broken ; notwithstanding which, their papers have been seized, and made use of as evidence against them, and many virtuous and meritorious individuals, have been, as cruelly as unjustly for their virtuous actions disgraced and destroyed by infamous and illegal sentences of transportation. And these unjust and wicked judgments have been executed with a rancour and malignity, never before known in this land; our respectable and beloved Fellow-citizens have been cast Fer TERED into Dungeons amongst felons in the Hulks, to which they were not sentenced. 
GARROW 1313 “ Citizens, We all approve the sentiments, and are daily repeating the words, for which these our respectable and valuable brethren are thus unjustly and inhumanly suffering. We too, associate in order to obtain a fair, free, and full representation of the ple in a house of real national representatives. Are we also willing to be treated as Fetons, for claiming this our inherent right, which we are determined never to forego but with om lives, and which none but thieves and traitors can wish to withhold from us? Consider, it is one and the same corrupt and corrupting influence which at this time domineers in Ireland, Scotland, and England. Can you believe that those who send virtuous Irishmen, and Scotchmen fettered with felons to Botany Bay, do not meditate and will not attempt to seize the first moment to send us after them? Or, if we had not just cause to apprehend the Same inhuman treatment; if instead of the most imminent danger, we were in perfect safety from it; should we not disdain to enjo any liberty or privilege whatever, in whi our honest Irish and Scotch brethren did not oquatly and as fully participate with us? Their cause then and ours is the same. And it is both our duty and our interest to stand or fall together. ‘The Irish parliament and the Scotch judges, actuated by the same English influence, have brought us directly to the point. There is no farther step beyond that which they have taken. We are at issue. We must now choose at once either liberty or slavery for ourselves and our posterity. Will you wait till BARRACKS are erected in every village, and till subsidized Hessians and Hanoveriais are upon us? 
GARROW 1314 “You may ask perhaps, by what means shall we seek redress ? 
GARROW 1315 “ We answer, that men ina state of civilized society are bound to seek redress of the puevances from the laws; as long as any reress can be obtained by the laws. But our common Master whom we serve (whose law is a law of liberty, and whose service is perfect freedom) has taught us not to expect to gather grapes from thorns, nor figs from thistles. We must have redress from our own laws and not from the laws of our plunderers, enemies, and oppressors, 
GARROW 1316 “ THERE IS NO REDRESS FOR A NATION CIRCUMSTANCED AS WE ARE, BUT IN A FAIR, FREE, AND FULL REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE. 
GARROW 1317 “ RESOLVED, that during the ensuing session of parliament, the general committee of this society do meet daily, for the purpose of watching the proceedings of the parliament and of the administration of the government of this country. And that upon the first introduction of any bill, or motion inimical to the liberties of the people, such as, for LANDING FOREIGN TROOPS IN GREAT-BRITAIN or IRELAND, for suspending the HABEAS CORPUS ACT, for proclaiming MARTIAL LAW, OR FOR PREVENTING THE PEOPLE FROM MEETING IN SOCIETIES for CONSTITUTIONAL INFORMATION, or any OTHER INNOVATION ofa similar nature, that, on any of these emergencies, the general committce shall issue summonses to the delegates of each division, and also to the secretarics of the different societies affiliated and corresponding with this society, forthwith to call a GENERAL CONVENTION of the PEUPLE, to be held at such place and in such a manner as shall be specified in the summons, for the purpose of taking such measures into their consideration.

GARROW 1342 Mr. Garrow to Davidson.—You said you were a inember of the London Corresponding Society; do you know John Martin
SCOTT 1343 Not much, I have only spoke to him two or three times, 
GARROW 1344 Where did you see him: I saw him once in his own house. 
GARROW 1345 Was he a member of the London Corresponding Society 
SCOTT 1346 I am not sure of that—I cannot prove tliat. 
GARROW 1347 Did you everseehim at any of the mee ings of that society 
SCOTT 1348 Yes; I have. 
GARROW 1349 as he there at the meeting that you have now been speaking of at the Globe tavern 
SCOTT 1350 I saw him there. 
GARROW 1351 That you have told us was a meeting of that society 
SCOTT 1352 Yes. 
GARROW 1353 Was Martin then amember of that Society
SCOTT 1354 I cannot say whether he was a member or not. 
GARROW 1355 Did any body attend that were not members at the meetings of the. society 
SCOTT 1356 I do not know, 
GARROW 1357 Upon your oath did you ever know any persons attend the meetings of the society that were not members of the society 
SCOTT 1358 There might be many that were not. 
GARROW 1359 pon your oath did you ever know any body attend them but the members? Was the business that you were with Mr. Martin upon, at his house, relative to the London Corresponding Society 
SCOTT 1360 It was. 
GARROW 1361 What was its nature 
SCOTT 1362 Relative to the latter part of the toasts and sentiments printed at the back of that paper. 
GARROW 1363 What passed between you and Mr. Martin respecting the latter part of the paper 
SCOTT 1364 I told him that I thought there were some hard words in some of the resolutions and toasts. He said, No; it was all constitutional, and there was no danger could arise from it. 
GARROW 1365 Was that between the 18th and 20th, or after the meeting
SCOTT 1366 It was the 21st, I believe, which happened on Tuesday. 
GARROW 1367 The day after the meeting 
SCOTT 1368 It was either the 2ist or the 2¢nd. 
GARROW 1369 I do not know whether you printed this
SCOTT 1370  No.; I never saw it. 
GARROW 1371 One of the Jury—You have not told us yet whether you knew that there was any one individual who attended those meetings that was not a member 
SCOTT 1372 There might be. 
GARROW 1373 Jurymun
SCOTT 1374 You have positively said to the contrary ; endeavour to recollect if there were not. 
EYRE 1375 Do they never admit visitors 
SCOTT 1376 Yes ; they do. 
EYRE 1377 There are visitors spoken of 
SCOTT 1378 There were tickets, I understand, to be given at the bar to any body that chose to call for them, or pay for them. 
GARROW 1379 That applies to the dinner at the Globe
SCOTT 1380 Yes. 
GARROW 1381 In the division meeting could any person who chose to ask for a acket, without being introduced by a member as a visitor, obtain it3—No. 
GARROW 1382 Do you know Mr. Thelwall 
SCOTT 1383 Yes., Are you acquainted with his manner of writing ?—Yes. 
GARROW 1384 Look at this, and tell me whether you believe this to be his hand-writing (showing a letter ta the wiiness]
SCOTT 1385 I believe the signature to be his. 
GARROW 1386 My lords, I will state the rounds on which we offer this letter as eviBence against the prisoner. We have already given evidence to prove that Mr. Thelwall was not only a member of the London Corresponding Society, but that in the publication of the resolutions passed at the anniversary meeting, and their toasts, he acted as the agent of the society. I now propose to read a letter of Mr. Thelwall’s, as a farther act of that agency. The letter purports to have contained several of these addresses ; it purports, and it will appear likewise by the proof, te have contained several seditious songs, stated to have been composed and sung by Mr. Thelwall at that meeting, which we allege to be another, perhaps a subordinate and inferior branch atthat conspiracy which was to bring all the constituent authorities in the country into contempt, so as to mature the public mind for that great change which we slate to have been the ultimate object of the society. We submit to your lordships, that any act of Mr. Thelwall’s, so in furtherance of this cunspiracy, is evidence against the defendant. It also gives an account of the state of the other affiliated societies in different parts of the world. I cannot state it better than in the language of the letter : London is not the only place that is alive: Scotland is full of liberty boys. Sheffield and many other towns are mentioned as being ina state of expectation for that great catastrophe which they all looked to about this period. 
ERSKINE 1387 Mr. Thelwall appears to have been an agent for the publication of this address, which turns out to be an act of the society, and to have ended in a dinner at which these toasts were drank. But the difficulty with me is this: if they could show that songs were actually sung at this meeting, which songs were indecent, or that they, in your lordship’s mind, or the opinion of the Jury, bear at all upon this case, I should not object in the smallest degree to these songs being read; but I very much doubt whether any account by Mr. Thelwall of these songs having been sung, can be evidence against Mr. Ifardy. What an agent docs is one thing, what an agent says has been done is quite another thing; nor will the construction which Mr. Thelwall may put upon these be at all evidence against Mr. Hardy. 
ERSKINE 1388 Mr. Thelwall inay, notwithstanding he acts for these societics, have some view of his own ; not that I impute any such to him, because E am of counsel for him in the indictment that will be afterwards tried against him; but A, B, C, D, E, F,—all the letters of the alphabet may meet for objects which they may all league in and be connected together, and if criminal, all criminal. But a declaration of one man, supposing he drives atany particularobject, and he makes use of any particularlanguage to express his mind with regard to that object, cannot, I humbly submit, be evidence against the prisoner. As far forth mostundoubtedly as all the acts of the society are piven in evidence, as far forth as any thing bas been said in the presence of Mr. Hardy at meetings he attended, all these are eve dence against him, and so is every thing that Mr. Thelwall does in this partial agency ; for Mr. Garrow has not established hin ‘to be the universal agent of Mr. Hardy, but only has proved bim to be the agent for procuring the printing of a particular paper. 
GIBBS 1389 We can have no anxiety to fesist the evidence that is now offered, except that if it be received we know not where it imay end. The question which your lordships and the jury are now to try, is, whether Mr. Hardy has compassed the king’s death, and whether he has done any of the acts charged in the indictment as overt acts in the prosecution of that design. The evidence offered now fo your lordships to prove this, is, that Mr. Thelwall, who is charged in the indictment to have ee in the same conSpiracies that are alleged against Mr. Hardy, that Mr. Thelwall, not by any communication with Mr. Hardy, not in consequence of any peso scheme between him and Mr. 
GIBBS 1390 Hardy, did write this letter. Now with respect to any thing that passed at the meeting at which Mr. Hardy was, with t to any thing that was done by any other person directed and instructed by Mr. Hardy to do that thing, we admit that those things which passed at the society in Mr. Har . 'presence, and that any thing which twas done by another person, by the direction of Mr. Hardy, gould be evidenee against Hardy ; but to what point in the indictment the letter written by Mr. Thelwall, of which it is not proved that Mr. Hardy ever had any knowledge, is directed, I confess I cannot see. The three questions are, first, Whether Mr. Hardy compassed the king's death; second, Whether he committed any of the acts which are stated as overt acts; and, third, Whether he committed them in the prosecution of a design upon the king’s life. I take it, that a letter written by Thelwall, without the knowledge of Hardy, cannot be evidence of the act of Hardy’s mind, namely, compassing the king’s death ; therefore, it cannot be evidence tpon the first ground. 
GIBBS 1391 With respect to the existence of the acts that are laid as overt acts, they must be proved Specifically upon al] the prisoners in the indictment. The present trial is only of Mr. Hardy. The present question is, Whether he Gid any of these acts. Then the declaration of another man, whether by word of mouth or by letter, cannot prove the fact upon Mr. Hardy. 
GIBBS 1392 Then, suppose the acts proved, the third thing to be proved is, that the act was done in the prosecution of a design upon the king’s life; then, nothing that is said, written, or done by a third person, without the authority of Mr. Hardy, ean Rue that Mr. Hardy meant to produce the effect which it is imputed to him he meant to produce; namely, the destruction of the king. Therefore I submit, that this letter written by Mr. Thelwall does not appear to conduce to the proof of either of the three things imputed by this indictment; wamely, That he compassed the king’s death; that he in point of fact committed any of the acts stated in the indictment as overt acts of that design; os supposing that he committed them, that any of ihese acts were direeted to the design of compassing the king’s death. I submit, that upon neither of these grounds is this letter admissible against Mr. Hardy, and therefore ought not to be received in evidence. I wish to repeat, that it is not from any anxiety we feel with respect to this letter, but because we wish that a rule should not be established in a case upon perhaps indifferent points, as a precedent for others that may ope rate materially in the cause. ‘ 
MACDONALD 1393 To whom is the letter addressed ? 
GARROW 1394 Yo a person of the name. of Vellam. 
GARROW 1395 ft certainly is not in my power to judge of the anxiety of my learned friends about the consequences of producing this letter, except as that anxiety induces them to object to its being read. It appears, that they are appre hensive of the effect and tendency of this letter, because they have made all the observations that occurred to them on the effect and tendency of this letter; and I am sure they will do me the justice to believe, that I mean no offence to them when I say I cannot discern any thing that is not justly, to be described to be argument upon the effect and tendency of the letter, which is argument ta he addressed to the jury. We conceive it is fit to be received in evidence, in order to cons vince the jury that this was done as a part of the agency of ‘Thelwall. But if we are not able to make it out in that way, we insist that the publishing by a larger circle that which was ordered to be printed for general publication, is clear evidence, being in furtherance of the general conspiracy. 
GARROW 1396 My friends seem to suppose that they can limit the acts of those who are not at presentat the bar, for consideration to things done either by themselves or their express order. We are very much mistaken if that be the rule of law. We humbly apprehend, that without revious concert as to the particolar fact done A. A. not being then upon his trial, if B. should have done the act, having been proved before to be a party to the general conspiracy, to be carried into effect by divers means and various instruments, that it is fit to receive evidence of the acts of all the parties to that conspiracy, in furtherance of that generak design ; for instance, it is not required that, in order to give evidence, that a conspirator hired his horse at a particular place, the hirin of which would connect him with the general conspiracy, the ground having been made, it is not necessary to show that he, to the person then trying, had communicated that he meant to go there to hire a horse; but the fact of his having done it is an accession to the general purposes of the conspiracy. All the acts of these persons, limiting it to the objects of the conspiracy, not extending it to crimes of another dye or character, but i furtherance of the general design of the grad conspiracy, we insist, coming from whom they may, whether it be the party upon: trial, whether it be in consequence of the orders given by him, whether communieated before or after, are evidence receivable, subject undoubtedly to the observations to be made upon their greater or lesser effect. 
EYRE 1397 I confess I have great doubt myself whether this evidence ought to be admitted. 1 agree, that where several persons are proved to be engaged ir one general conspiracy, that all the transactions of that conspiracy by the different parfies, may and ought to be given in evidence ; and it is enough if the party accused at this time can be proved to be-privy to that general conspiracy ; for if that is proved, every thin that is done by the different parties concern: in it, must be also imputed to him asa ah of the transaction of that conspiracy. I understand this letter, it is nothing more than Mr. Thelwall’s account to a private friend, of a part which he had taken respecting this paper, and of his having composed songs. And I remember another passage in it, which is very material as against Thelwall, but, in Ty mind, should be reserved till it comes to the time when Thelwall’s own declarations come to be proper evidence. 
EYRE 1398 I doubt whether we ought to consider this Racal letter as any thing more than Mr. 
EYRE 1399 helwall’s declaration; and Thelwall’s declaration ought not to be evidence of any thing which, si remotely connected with this plot, yet still does not amount to any transaction done in the course of the plot, for the furtherance of the plot, but is a mere recital of his, a sort of confession of his of some part that he had taken. It appearsto me, that that is not like the evidence which we before admitted of a fact done by Mr. Thelwall in carrying the papers and delivering them to the printer, which is a part of the transaction itself. His account of that transaction seems to me to stand quite upon a different footing. It seems just the same as an act which shall bind a man, because he is connected with the person that did the act; and his declaration, which shall not bind him, because it is no part of the act. 
GARROW 1400 He says, “ You will also receive enclosed several copies of Addresses published by the society. It is upon that 
GARROW 1401 ‘ound I submit it to your lordship. 
EYRE 1402 To be sure, as far as the transmission of these papers go, it does stand upon another footing; but I should be sorry if the letter was to be read for so immaterial a purpose, as that is only to introduce something which in my mind ought not to be evidence in this case. 
BULLER 1403 I am strongly inclined to think, that this letter is evidence, and ought to be received. There are two things to be considered in an indictment of this sort. First, Whether any conspiracy exists; next, What share the prisoner took in that coniracy. 
BULLER 1404 It appears to me, that when we are consjyse dering the first question, any thing that passed from any person who is proved to be a party in the conspiracy ought to be received as evidence, and it is received for the purpose of showing what was the extent and nature of the conspiracy. Now if the case stood merely upon this ground, that Thelwall, one of the’ conspirators, had said their object was so and so, that, I take it, would be evidence; it bas been admitted, I conceive, in a variety of cases that have happened upon similar questions with the present. In Dammaree and Purchase’s cases evidence was received of what some of the parties had done when the prisoner was not there. The attorney general says, I calIthis witness, not to speak in particular to the prisoner, but to shew the intention of the mob. On the trial of lord Southampton something said by lord Essex, previous to the prisoner’s being, there, was admitted as evidence. In the cases that have happened, in our own time, in Lord George Gordon’s case, evidence of what different persons of the mob had said, though he was not there, was admitted. In all the cases at St. Margaret’shill, the same thing was admitted, and with a view of showing what was the design then on foot, which is a very distinct question from the question of whether the prisoner was or not concerned to the extent that others might have been. As Mr. Garrow states this letter, it seems to me to have that effect, for it shews what some of the parties at least intended by meetings they had held, and what they proposed to effect. In that light, therefore, it seems tome to be evidence. But before it can affect the prisoner materially, it is necessary to make out Snother point, namely, that he consented to the extent that the others did; but still, while we are upon the question as to the design, it appears to me that any thing that haa eet said, still more any thing that has been written by the conspirators, ought to be received in evidence, to prove what that design was. 
GROSE 1405 I must confess, I have very great doubts upon this subject. The majority of the cuurt is for rejecting the evidence. It does seem to me, I must confess, at least very doubtful whether it ought to be rejected; for it appears to me, that this is evidence of what the parties meant by whag was done at a place where both these parties were present, and both members of one society, and professedly concerned in one plan; it is therefore very material to hear what either of them says respecting this plan, for there is mo doubt about it that these papers are respecting this plan, to show the extent of the plan, and the intention, the animus with which these rele met, and were publishing these papers; therefore, in ‘that light, I must confess, what my brother Buller has said has struck me very much. But, exdlusive of that, from the beginning ‘the inclination of my opinion was and is, that it is evidence. 
MACDONALD 1406 It is certainly a case that has a great dead of doubt attending it; but at the same time I can hardly bring my own mind to consider this as falling within Mr. Garrow’s own definition. It must be something in furtherance of the conspiracy. I agree, that any act done by one, is, to a certain extent, imputable to another; that is, it may be given in evidence to show the general conspiracy in which ‘he was engaged; but an act done, appears to me to be different from the mere relation of it by another person, a mere relation of what passed given by one in a private letter to another. I have much doubt whether it is evidence that ought to be received. 1 am, myselt, inclined to reject it. 
HOTHAM 1407 I am of the same oinion as my lord chief justice and my lord cief baron. I do not think this is evidence fit to be received. I do not think itisa partthe transaction of the plan to be carried into execution. I consider it as a mere relation of what has passed, which, if it is to affect the prisoner, ought to be confined to the real fact that happened at the time to which this relation alludes. Llowever, there is no evidence to prove that what is stated for a fact in this letter, by which the prisoner is to be implicated, actually did happen. 
EYRE 1408 After having heard my lord chief baron and my brothers upon it, I really am of opinion thatt is too questionable to received as evidence, except upon the ground last stated by Mr. Garrow, upon which (if he insists on it) it must be received. 
GARROW 1409 Certainly not. 
EYRE 1410 In the cases of Dammarce and lord George Gordon, the cry of the mob at the time made a part of the fact, of the transaction, therefore I have no doubt that such evidence ought to be received ; but I confess I have so great a doubt upon the admissibility of this letter, that I prefer 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1411 My lord, I should have no idea of pressing this, but mercly with a view to similar questions which may arise.. 
ERSKINE 1412 They will be discussed when they arise. 
EYRE 1413 Correspondence Mid often makes a part of the transaction, and where correspondence makes a part of the transaction, the correspondence of one man who is a party in a conspiracy, would undoubtedly be evidence, correspondence in furtheranee of the plot: a correspondence of a private nature, a mere relation of what had been done, appears a different thing. 
GARROW 1414  
GARROW 1415 lord, I now proj to Jead a letter upon the principle of Nes Wan & 
GARROW 1416 correspondence between one of the persons proved to have been a party in the conspiracy, and another person at a distant part of t kingdom, likewise proved to be a party in the conspiracy: it is a letter from Mr. Martin, after the dinner at the Globe tavern, to Mr. Margarot, who was at that time in custody in the Tolbooth, at Edinburgh, having been one of the persons apprehended by the magistracy at Edinburgh, as a part of that British Convention whom the magistracy dispersed. The letter is in terms calculated to excite the spirit of the brethren of the North: it hkewise contains a declaration of the universal approbation of the conduct of those delegates in the North, and it states other circumstances of a public nature; the maner in which his majesty had met Ais parliament, as it is stated —the manner in which his majesty is stated by this writer to have been received by the people, and insulted, and his life endangered, as this writer states it, still poing on with a view to excite and encourage them in a distant part of the kingdom, by disseminating the same doctrines, which, in .London, these people disseminated. 
ERSKINE 1417 I apprehend that this letter, upon no principle, can be evidence; T shalf not draw the Court at all into the construction of the statute of king Edward the third, at this moment; the prisoner is upon his deliverance on the general issue, and I shall address your lordships and the jury upon that subject in due season: at present, I shall content myself with saying what has been said twice to-day already ; first in the morning by myself, after wards by my friend who sits by me, that this isan indictment for compassing and imagining the death of the king; and that there are overt-acts stated in the indictment, which are laid as acts done in pursuance of, and. in ac complishment of—or to use the language of the indictment, to fulfil the traitorous intention, which is the charge upon the record. 
ERSKINE 1418 It is impossible for my friends to go farther than to contend, by these acts, that they involve in themselves, as they are pleased to say, a forcible subversion of the government of the country, which would involve in it as a consequence, the death of the king, and that therefore it is an overt-act, or, in other words, relevant evidence to prove the criminal intention, which is the subject matter of this indictment. But your lordships permit, and ought to permit, t allow, any other acts of the prisoner, to be given in evidence, which decypher his mind to the jury; any expressions of his own, any thing that he has said, any thing that he has done, which points directly and relevantly to the purpose of this indictment; for I hope your lordships will never cease to recollect, that the crime charged upon the record, is the compassing the death of the king, and that the overt-act is the means the defendant is charged to have made use of in the accomplishment of that criminal apd detestable purpose. 
ERSKINE 1419 Then let. us see the danger of allowing the letter of a man, who is not charged even upon this record, as a conspirator with the prisoner at the bar: Mr. Martin has had a bill found against him, which of course we know nothing of—we only read of itin the neswspapers; but we, who are of counsel for the prisoner, are counsel for hit as having engaged in a conspiracy with the other prisoners now in Newate, and with other persons to the jurors unknown, for the purpose of sceorapliehing this detestable apie of destreying the king; and your lordships will see what a pretty piece of work you are cutting out for yourselves, if this evidence be admitted. Any thing that Mr. Martin says, or writes, can, upon no principle of common sense (to leave law out of the question), be considered as evidence to criminate any body, except as he is a member of the Corresponding Society, which, by-the-by, he is not yet proved to be. 
GARROW 1420 Davison proved that he was a member 
ERSKINE 1421 We will take Mr. Martin, for argument sake, to be a member of the Corresponding Society. I shall be glad to Know upon what principle can your lordships fo out of the overt-acts charged in the indictment; upon what poeple upon earth can you go beyund evidence of the direct conspiracy charged upon the defendant, but upon this wholesome ground, which we do not stand here to contradict, namely, that any thing which can decypher the mind of the prisoner to the jury, from whence they can collect that he intended the death of the king, may be evidence against him; then, according to that, any members of the Corresponding Society whom you could have brought together when Mr. Hardy was not speal ing of the king, when he was not reviling the king, or attempting any thing that could lead to his Majesty’s death, unless, according to the argument which we heard at large, yesterday, of certain consequences which were to arise from the representation of the people in par liament—it would render that innocent man at the bar, as I have aright to style him until the jury have pronounced a contrary verdict — it would make him answerable for every wicked thing that any man has said, or that any man has written. I collect from what fell from Mr. Garrow, but still more from the opening of this letter, yesterday, by the attorney general, that Mr. 
ERSKINE 1422 artin writes, in some flippant manner, of a pattcn being thrown at his majesty, upon his return from his erlement (o bick, by-the-by, is the style and pees of the law, for it is his parliament); but, if Mr. Martin chooses to express himself in a contemptuous manner either of the king or of his parliament, and if that is to be evidence to decypher the mind of any body, it is evidence to decypher the mind of Mr. Martin, not of Mr. Hardy. Do not common sense, common honour, and common justice, revolt alike at it? We have got names we cannot help, because in a court of justice we sometimes talk of a plot and sometimes of a conspiracy ; but I say, that all that has been laid before your lordships to-day and yesterday, amounts no matter to what, I am not to pronounce the law, it is the Court—but amounts to an assembly of a great numt-er of peuple in ditferent parts of this island, all pursuing one purpose. Your lordships will recollect, that the conspiracy, if it is to be called a conspiracy, does not exist in the members of the Corresponding Sacicty alone, for the ac-, complishment of this purpose; they corresponded with Sheffield—they corresponded with Manchester, with Leeds, with Norwich, with Dumfermline, with Edinburgh, and with a great number of other places. According to the doctrine now contended for, the declaration of every man, not the declaration of what his olject was—it has not been stated that any of them said, “ the object of all our meetings is to destroy the king ; but jf any absurd, intemperate man, drunk or sober, chooses to utter an express contemptuous of the king, that is to be evidence to decy pher Mr. Hardy’s mind. I do not stand up to approve of any man’s uttering any contemptuous expression of the sort; but if Mr. Martin has uttered such an expression, when Mr. Martin is upon his trial, the good sense of the jury will consider how far such an expression as that will weigh as against hin; but I enter my solemn protest ya this being given as evidence to affect Mr. Hardy. My lords, toust needs do so, when I heard an expression imputed yesterday in the opening, by the attorney general, in this cause, to another person
SCOTT 1423 Suppose, for instance, any man of al}, that society, should say an intemperate, an absurd, or a criminal thing: why now, for instance, suppose a man takes the head off a pot of porter, and says, I should like to cut off the heads of kings, should I not know what the context was? must I not know what kings they were speaking of, whether speaking of those kings which he might think allied toe gether for a purpose destructive to the principles of justice end humanity, or whether he meant any thing that could lead even to an idea of the king of Great-Britain ? 
ERSKINE 1424 But supposing any men connected in a scheme tor the reform of parliament; I wil] suppose it in the case of honourable men, wha meet in a society (of which I am a member) for the purpose of a reform of parliament, for any thing I know, if the papers of that society were laid before your lordships, there might be found expressions in them which y lordships might think intemperate, expressions which you might think illegal—expressions which vou might think ought not to be used ; and as far as your lordships could impute any of these expressions to me, if they could be tairly imputed, that would be one thing: but, good God! what man could ever enter himself into any society for any one obj whatever, if the language and if the writings of every individual composing that society. could be given in evidence against him. 
ERSKINE 1425 I woul only ask where this is ta stop; because I have a right to say, if Mr. Martin is to be considered to be the decypherer of the mind of Mr. Hardy, then J must enter into a defence of the mind of Mr. Martin: I must call witnesses to Mr. Martin’s character; for, if there is any objection to that,Ihave taken the pains in preparing for this momentous trial, to look from the earliest period of our history down to the present hour, through all the questions that have been put to witnesses with regard to the declaration of their sentiroents of persons accused, for the purpose of their exculpation. Can you go the length of making a declaration of Mr. Martin’s contemptuous behaviour towards the king evidence not only to show that he thought lightly ofthe king, but that every other man did, who met for anuther purpose, and for another end? 
ERSKINE 1426 Is it meant to be gravely said here, that if persons meet together for the accomplishment of a purpose, which purpose appears by the evidence to be what I have no right to say, because until your lordships and the jury decide, whether it is to obtain a fair representation of the people in parliament by constitutional means, or whether it is any thing else, what quality the law shall annex to it, is matterIwill not break in upon, for various Teasons, at this moment. As the prisoner stands accused of compassing the death of the king, every thing he has done himself, every thing done in his presence, every thing said in his presence, to which he may be supposed to assent, by continuing to meet the same ns again, is to be received in evidence. 
ERSKINE 1427 ow, for instance, if Mr. Martin had said this in the presence of Mr. Hardy, and afterwards he is found living with Mr. Hardy, it might be said so far Hardy might be considered as approving the conduct of Mr. Martin. I understand this to be a letter found; I do not know where, for that, is not even stated. 
GARROW 1428 It is a letter addressed to Margarot, at Edinburgh, he being a misSionary from this society. 
EYRE 1429 Where was it found ? what is the fact? 
WHITE 1430 It was not found among his yers, but we shall prove it to be Martin’s hand-writing. 
ERSKINE 1431 Suppose, instead of being a letter to Margarot, it had been a letter to Hardy himself, it would not be evidence; I cannot help a man’s writing a letter to me— the post may bring it, and it may be found in my custody; if any man were to write a letter to me by the post, containing matters I highly disapproved, your lordships could not criminate me because this letter was found in my custody. 
ERSKINE 1432 I wish this to be considercd, in order for our lordships to see the extent to which this ineiness isopened. Weare now faradvanced ip the second day, upon an indictment for compassing the death of the king; and, ifyour lordships look through the State Trials, from the beginning of our history to the present time, you will find what has been remarked by the Court, that it has never been necessary to have recourse to the expedients employcd last night, by the indulgence of the, Court, in a case of high treason. In the case of Elizabeth Canning, I understand it was done. But, if this ficld of evidence is to be gone into, I protest I cannot see when this willend, because I am sure that your lord, wae will do impartial justice, and, therefore, if this letter of Mr. Martin’s is to be read, Mr. Martin, of course, must be allowed to explain it. If the crown can give the letter in evidence, because Mr. Martin happened to be a member of the London Corresponding Society, every man’s letters, who was a member of any of these societies, which were in correspondence together (for your lordship will recollect, that the conspirators, if there are any, are all who have been moving to this purpose by affiliated societies), their bureaus might be broken open, their letters intercepted at the post-office, or he seized upon by the magistracy, and your lord ship might have to read the correspondence of every man in these societies ; I wish to know that, because it may be material, and 1 may withdraw my objection. Shall I, in my turn, be allowed to produce the letters of all the members of these societies to their friends? Certainly not; it would be absurd and foolish to expect it: therefore, upon every principle of law, I object to this letter of Mr. Martin’s being read, unless it can be shown that his letter is connected with something that Mr. Hardy and he have done together, and that it can be brought home to Mr. Hardy, that he knew the facts contained in that Neier, and that it was something done in the furtherance and accomplishment of a conspiracy between them, I certainly must object to any improper expressions in this letter being imputed to Mr. Hardy—I object to its being given in evidence. 
GIBBS 1433 After this point has been so ably argued by Mr. Erskine, I can add but very little; but this I must say, that it seems to be offering this letter with an endeavour to bring: befure your lordships precisely the same question again, If I touk what your lordship said accurately, when the decision was given upon the last point, and that evidence was rejected, your lordship said, that in Dammaree’s case, and in lord George Gordon’s case, it was true, that the declarations of persons when the prisoners were not present were received in evidence; but they were received for this reason, because they had becn present at the collection of the mob, and, during the riots of those mobs, in the transactions of which it was endeavoured to implicate the prisoners : what they declared while they were in action, was admissible evidence, to show what the object of these insurrections was, and therefore it was re ceived: but your lordships have never determined, tbat that which was declared by a pergon unconnected with the prisoner at the bar, except as he may, at particular occasions, have been brought into his company, could in any case be received as evidence. 
GIBBS 1434 i understand the line to be this: when a fman is indicted for that which is done by a great collection of men assembled together, and he is present at some times and absent at others, the declarations of other men acting with him in that very act for which he is indicted, are admissible evidence to show what the object of that assembly was: But why was the letter last offered, rejected? For this reason, because it contained a relation of facts, of which relation of facts the prisoner was not cognizant: he did not know that these facts were so related: What is the present letter? I asked to see it before I addressed your lordships: I was told I must not sec it, that it was irregular; from what I have collected of it, it is no more than the last letter: it contains a relation of facts, and then they would add to it, that the object of this relation of facts, was to keep up the spirits of a person at Edinburgh; ifunderstood the argument, that was the drift of it. 
GARROW 1435 It was stated to be an excitaYon in terms. 
GIBBS 1436 Certainly ; I am arguing under great difficulties; my object was, to show at this is the same question which your 
GIBBS 1437 Lordships have decided upon the former argument; I desired to see the letter before I addressed my argument to your lordships, which may certainly be all mere air, if I am mistaken in the fact; I was told in point of regularity, I could notseethe letter, and therefore I can only argue it upon the recoliection of what was loosely stated: it might be sc intended, in the mind of the writer of it, to keep up the spirits of Mr. Margarot : But was that object communicated to the prisoner? Did he mean that those facts should be so related? The real object for producing this letter, is this—that the representation of facts contained in that letter, b the writer of it (and in the writing of which fetter the prisoner is not in any respect implicated), that the narration of facts by the writer of the letter, should be fixed upon the peisoners that whatever the writer of that letter has improvidently, foolishly, rashly, or I will say unlawfully expressed in that letter that rashness, folly, or illegality, may be fixed upon Mr. Hardy. It seems to me, that this case comes directly within the spirit of your lordships decision upon the last argument. 
GIBBS 1438 Cases were stated upon the last argument, in which the declarations of third persons were received against a prisoner; but it was only in cases where the prisoner was indicted for joining in the act of a multitude, where persons are sometimes present and sometimes abpent; a part of that multitude, at the time they were unlawfully collected, for which unlawful collection the prisoner was among others indicted; part of them had deel what was their object. I agree that may be evidence against a prisoner, and he must exculpate himself if he can; but that a letter shauld be evidence against Mr. Hardy, which he never saw, and for a purpose to which he never acceded, seems to me against all law, and I am sure that it is against all justice ; for the object of this indictment is to try the mind of Mr. Hardy—to try whether he did in his mind compass the death of the king. And surely, justice docs not require that that which is proved to pass in the mind of one man ahauld fix a similarity of sentiment in the mind of another, who neither directed the letter to be written which is offered in evidence, nor ever afterwards knew that the letter was written, which letter too never was received. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1439 I will trouble your lordship with a very few words upon this point, and, I trust, your lordship will be of opinion that it is unquestionably evidence. Certain persons are indicted for endeavouring to procure a Convention to be assembled to subvert the legislature, rule and government, now duly ani happily established in this kingdom, and other overt-acts of the same tendency. Now upon the very Eencivs which has been just stated by Mr. Gibbs, it appears to me that this is evidence. The principle which is stated by Mr. Gibbs is, that that, which is declared by conspirators, whilst in action, is evidence against those who were not presentat the time, as well as against those who were present at the time. 
GIBBS 1440 I beg your pardon, I would not have you take my argument improperly ; I did not say conspirators in action, but I said that where a number of men are indicted for acts of violence in which they unite, and the prisoner is sometimes present and sometimes absent, that what is stated by some of those persons who are said to co-operate with him in some of those acts of violence may be evidence. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1441 I am very - litle capable of distingutahing between whatstated and what Mr. Gibbs now says. I take this to be a declaration of conspirators in the progress of their conspiracy, and I take that to be exactly the distinction between this case, and that which your lordships have determined, with respect to which it is my duty to submit to the judgment of the Court. That was a letter addresscd to a person, whom we have not shown to be, in any degree, involved in the conspiracy, to a Mr. Vellam; whereas this is a letter, addressed by Mr. Martin, who is proved to be chairman of the meeting on the 20th of January, to Maurice Margarot, who was the deputy froty the Corresponding Society, at the Convention which was held at Edinburgh; itis, therefore, a conversation, by letter, between two persons who were parties to the conspiracy, if there existed any conspiracy ; for, in all these cases, the first question your lordships and the jury will have to consider, is the existence of a conspiracy, and the object of that conspiracy ; and then, whether the person charged was party to that conspiracy. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1442 Now for the purpose of showing the existence of a conspiracy, and for the purpose of showing what the views of the conspirators were, bow far they went, conversations of those conspirators totally distinct from the prisoner, have constantly been admitted to be iven in evidence. In the case of my lord Stafford, which was a prosecution, by impeachment in parliament, for high treason, in compassing the death of the king, and proceeding to great length; the evidence that was first given was simply, and only of the general plot, by persons who were capable, as they afterwards proved by their testimony, of bringing that treason specifically home to lord Stafford; they were not examined to that point at first, but were examined simply, and only to the general plot; one thing which may proved in the course of that evidence, with respect to the general plot, I will state to your lordships; it was a discourse between Anderton, Campion, Green, and several other persons, with which lord Stafford had no sort of connexion whatever, in which those persons told the witness, that there would be a great alteration in England ere long; that the king was an heretic, and might be destroyed; that they industriously preached this doctrine, and that the duke of York was with them. Evidence was iven of these conversations. Who were e persons that held these conversations? They were not persons included in the impeachment of lord Stafford, but persons to whom it was imputed that they were in the common and general conspiracy, which was cbarged to exist, for .the purpose of the restoration of the Roman Catholic religion in this country, and for the purpose of deposing the king, and subverting the government of the country. The manner in which serjeant Maynard states the evidence which was to be given, seems to me to be perfectly clear. He says, “ This is a treason of a faction, and of a general party in the nation : it is not this or that lord, but a great pumber; itis not this or that lord that is mentioned in the articles, but the conee is of a great faction. This do we ink, and this makes us so earnest to press the general before your lordships, that we may give satisfaction to your lordships, and the world, what this plot hath been, and how carried on every where. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1443 My lords, the consequence of that is very t; for, my lords, if there were a general lesign, and a general plot, as clearly there was, some were to act in Spain, and some in France; some in other places; some in Ireland, Scotland, and England, and a great number of jesuits (we have a matter of hiny in chase about this business)I say, my lords, if it be so, if one action be in one place, and another in another, yet if there be a common consent to accomplish this plot, then what the one dves is the act of all, and the act of all is the act of every one. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1444 “ My lords, the persons were many, and the places and times many they acted in, and the designs which they were to accomplish and the means wherewith they were to accomplish them were many tou. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1445 My lords, in the case of lord Lovat, the same sort of doctrine is laid-down with respect to the evidence
SCOTT 1446 The solicitor general of that time says, “It is necessary, therefore, by general evidence, to show that there have been such plots and conspiracies as the Commons assert, and then to affect the noble lord at the bar, by proper evidence, with being concerned in these plots. It was so, he says, in lord Stafford’s case, and at the “ trials at law of the persons accused of having been in the same plot. The same method was allowed as proper, and liable to no just objection, in many trials after the revolution. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1447 This was said upon an objection that was taken to the evidence of Mr. Murray, of Broughton
SCOTT 1448 Mr. Murray proceeded in his relation of the conspiracy; and one part of the evidence which Re then gave was, that lord Traquair had informed him, that a Mr. Drummond had carried over to Paris a memorial, and a list of all the gentlemen in Scotland, who would support the Pretender; that he had conversed with Drummond; that Drummond was then in Edinburgh, and prosed that he should have a meeting with im ; tbat he had a meeting with Drummon who repeated much the same thing, and sai he had been extremely well received by the cardinal; that is cardinal Fleury.—Several other parts of his evidence were to the same tendency.—What was this but giving evidence of conversations between twoconspiratorsupon thesubject of the plot, for the purpose of showing what was the nature, tendency, and objects of the plot, and what were the views of the several persons who were concerned in it? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1449 With submission to your lordships, this letter is evidence upon the same ground
SCOTT 1450 It is evidence, yuo animo, Mr. Martin acted. I do not mean to say, it is direct evidence, quo animo, Mr. Hardy acted, but it is the nature of all plots that this sort of evidence should be given; several persons are concerned; they are brought into one engage ment; some of them may certainly have views less culpable than others, but still, for the purpose of a jury determining what is the guilt of the particular person charged, the views, the imtentions, declared by conversation, as well as otherwise, ofthe several persons concerned in the plot, and especially when it happens to be conversations between two of the persons concerned in the plot, which, with submission, a letter from one of the persons engaged in it, to another of those persons is, then I submit, that it is a matter which may fairly and properly be given in evidence, consistent with the determination your lordships have made, and upon the very foundation, that it is what passes between persons engaged in a conspiracy, while the conspiracy is in its process towards that conclusion, which we submit the conspirators had in view. 
ADAIR 1451 It is not on account Of the importance of this particular piece of evidence that I take the liberty of addressing a very few words to your lordships, upon the subject of the objection that has bcen made, but from an impression of the very great importance of the principle upon which this obJection may be decided, and the extensive application of it to other cases that may in future occur, 
ADAIR 1452 In order to understand the objection, it is necessary to state the ground upon which this evidence is offered: and I conceive that a reat part of the argument of my learned iend, who very ingeniously stated this objection at first, is answered by a cunsideration of the ground upon which this evidence is offered ; for I do not conceive, and I, for one, do not offer the evidence to the Court upon the ground, that the idle expressions of 
ADAIR 1453 Mr. Martin respecting the king,—that the relation of an accidental fact that happened im the Park, within Mr. Martin's knowledge, respecting the king, is any evidence at all against the prisoner; but it is upon this ground, that a part of that letter which we offer in evidence is alleged to relate, and your lordships, when it is read, will find that it does relate to an act done by the conspirators, as itis contended, in the furtherance and prosecution of that conspiracy which is by the indictment imputed to the prisoner. 
EYRE 1454 Be so good as state a little more particularly what that is. 
ADAIR 1455 It is a statement from one of the conspirators, who had been in the chair at the meeting of those whom we call the conspirators, held, as it has been alleged, for the purpose of furthering the views of that conspiracy—it is a statement of that conspirator to another person, alleged to be a conspirator, of what fees at that mecting, so held
SCOTT 1456  Now the charge against the prisoner is the compassing the king’s death, by means of a conspiracy, to overturn the constituted authorities of the state, and the government of the country, under. colour of a professed design only to make a reform in parliamentary representation, and to correct abuses in one’ branch of the legislature; a design which, pursued by innocent and proper means, might possibly be either wholly innocent, oramount to a guilt infinitely less than that which is charged by this indictment; but when such a conspiracy as is imputed to the prisoner, is alleged to be carried on under colour of such a pretext, many of the acts of those conspirators must, in their nature, be equivocal, and admit of different constructions.—How are these constructions to be colected,—how is that ambiguity to be removed,—but by views of the conduct and declarations of the persons alleged to be in the conspiracy itself !—It is upon that ground, and that alune, that this is submitted to the Court as the statement of the proceedings at a meeting, by one conspirator to another conspirator, implicated in the general design, but not present at that meeting.—It seems to me, that there is no kind of evidence that can tend more directly to develope the real intention of the parties in the transaction, than that species of evidence which is now offered.—I do not mean to contend, that the letter, when read, which I have cast my eye over, will itself go any great length in effectuating that purpose, but the nature of the evidence is such as may be important, fee s, in other instances, much more so than the present; and the principle is extensive in its application, not only to the trials upon the present occasion, but those that may hereafter occur in this country, and at times when this trial may become a precedent to posterity. 
ADAIR 1457 The grounds upon which this evidence ig offered to the Court, seem to me to fall directly within the principle of lord Stafford’s case; but, even f it eould be distinguished from other cases, I think it cannot be distinguished from the cases of Dammaree and lord 
ADAIR 1458 3eorge Gordon ; and the distinction that has been attempted between an act of violence, or any other act, in furtherance ofa conspiracy, FE confess I do not feel much the force of. — This comes so completely within the principle of lord George Gordon's case, that it is impossible, without holding that case net to be law, to reject this evidence. 
ADAIR 1459 Your lordships will pardon me for having made these observations ; it was merely from the importance of the principle, and not from the least idea that the letter, when read, will be thought to be very much in itself. 
BEARCROFT 1460 I make no apology for troubling your lordships with a few observations upon this point; it is a case of ve great imjortance; and when I say that, I am sure I shall be understood, that I do not stand up to speak of the importance of it, because I am likely to give any extraordinary assistance, but, inasmuch as it is of so great and general importance, I, therefore, feel it m: duty to attempt to do it in the best way can
SCOTT 1461 I shall, in doing it, avoid two things 3 
BEARCROFT 1462 —I will not attempt to break into, or controvert, the rule that has been already laid down by the Court, as I understand it—I will not repeat a syllable that has been said b the learned gentleman before me—but I thin: I can add another observation upon this letter, which would entitle it to be read. 
BEARCROFT 1463 When I say I will not controvert the rule Jaid down, as I understand it, I wish to state, in order that I may be corrected if I misunderstand it, how I suppose it to have been laid down,—as I understand it, it was decided, by the authority of the Court, that a mere narration of simple facts that have passed is not admissible evidence; I think that cannot well be disputed ; my humble judgment certainly goes with that decision, if it is carried no farther; but when a question of evidence, and of great extent and iniportance, is befure the Court, I have been always taught, that the way to decide upon the competency and admissibility of that evidence is to consider,— What is the question trying 
SCOTT 1464 Against whom is the testimony offered ?—What is the nature of it?—To what purpose is it adduced? 
BEARCROFT 1465 Now I understand, or I am grossly mistaken in the whole of this proceeding, that the object of it is to show, that the prisoner at the aris guilty of high treason, of the species chargedin this indictment, by the means, and by overt acts, which amount to a conspiracy, with many others, to carry that treasonable intent into execution; that is the nature of the charge
SCOTT 1466 The consequence I conceive most clearly to be this, that though it is an indictment for high treason, yet, because that high treason is to be carried into execution by the means ofa conspiracy, that all the evidence ‘which will, by law, be admissible upon the trial of a minor conspiracy, a conspiracy not treasonable, will be admissible likewise upon the present inquiry. 
BEARCROFT 1467 Now, my lords, I take it to be a settled rule in the trial of an indictment for a conspiracy of every kind, that when once you have established, that the prisoner at the bar has conspired together with others, not then upon trial, in the indictment—nay I go farther, not charged in the indictment : When I sa: established, Ido not mean established decidedly, that they are guilty of the conspiracy, but that there is evidence admissible, and to be laid before the jury, upon which they are to exercise their judgment—then I have a right to give in evidence the acts of others, so connected. 
BEARCROFT 1468 My lord, it cannot he disputed, that some evidence to prove the conspiracy is in the possession of the Court; nay, it is in the possession of the jury; for it cannot be in possession of the Court, without being in possession of the jury; they have heard it, of ; course, as it has been admitted
SCOTT 1469 We have got thus far, that the prisoner at the bar wasengaged in a conspiracy, together with Martin and Margarot—they two corresponded by , letter—they two conversed, in writing, as has much of the purport as is necessar: 
BEARCROFT 1470 been rightty stated by Mr. Solicitor General. 
BEARCROFT 1471 What is the object of the conspiracy 
SCOTT 1472 We contend it is to overturn the government, and depose the king, whereby it isobvious, to any common understanding, that the life of the king is in danger.—Now I contend, therefore, with the utmost deference to the Court, that this letter is competent evidence—no matter how far it extends, or how short it goes—if it goes any step atall; but I confess that I feel, and I am sanguine enough to state, that: goes pointedly, importantly, and directly to the matter of high treason charged in the indictment.—I said I would not repeat a syllable that had been urged by the gentlemen before me, but I desire to be understood, that my mind goes with them entirely, and accedes to every part of their arguments. 
BEARCROFT 1473 I beg leave to advert to another part of this letter, that, I say, goes pointedly to show, that the design was for compassing the mischievous, the traitorous,—I had very nearly said the personal destruction of the king. What I advert to in this letter, I will read te our lordships in the very words : “ The 
BEARCROFT 1474 ‘ing went yesterday to meet Ais parliament. Your lordships will mark the expression; it is very decent, but— 
ERSKINE 1475 I must beg to interrupt my learned friend ; I beg his pardon ; that part of the letter has been, within these three minutes, expressly given up by Mr. Serjeant Adair, as counsel for the crown, who finished what he had to say before my friend got up, by saying, that that part of the letter which my friend now chooses to read aloud, in the hearing of the jury, he did not mean to contend to be evidence against the prisoner—and, therefore, if the letter comes to be read, the letter will be read with the omission of that part; or if the omission did not take place, that part is admitted by Mr. Serjeant Adair, not to be evidence against the prisoner. 
EYRE 1476 The interruption is not quite proper : because, if it were so, that my brother Adair had distinctly admitted it in that manner, yet that could not conclude the argument of another learned gentleman, if he was of opinion he could maintain it. 
ERSKINE 1477 Does your lordship think, that it is consistent with the rules which must 
ERSKINE 1478 ; bind us upon this occasion, that, in arguing the admissibility of a piece of evidence, they are not merely to state to the Court the general nature of it, so that the Court may ive its decision before a thing, which, peraps, is not afterwards to be received in evidence, should make any thing like an impression, but to read the paper itself. 
EYRE 1479 No; only so 'y to inform the Court of the nature of it. 
ERSKINE 1480 My friend is not merely reading the lettcr, in that part which one of the counsel, at least, admitted not to be evidence, but he is commenting upon it, step by stcp
SCOTT 1481 I apprehend my friend may state, that there is an expression personally reflectin, upon the king ; but, in order to argue the admissibility of any piece of evidence, it is not to be reall by the counsel for the crown inthe hearing of the jury; because if, after the counsel has read it, in the hearing of the jury, the Court say it is not admissible evidence against the prisoner, it may lead to affect the prisoner, because it may affect the minds of the jury, in a manner inconsistent with the nature of the testimony received on the trial. lam now, I understand, in possession of your lordships judgment upon this point. 
ADAIR 1482 As my friend has done me the honour to advert more to what fell from me than the weight of it seemed to deserve, I heg leave to state and explain what I did say upon the subject. I did state, and I do not mean to retract it, that the part of the letter which I alluded to, when 1 spoke, was not the ground upon which we offered it to P ha lordships, and would not, of itself, Make that evidence against the prisoner; but I did never state, that if there was that in the letter, upon the ground of which I contended it was proper evidence, as applicable evidence to the charge against the prisoner, that the whole context of that letter should not be taken together, in order to show the intention of the parties who are implicated in that design. I have never admitted that. But his lordship has certainly truly said, that my admission does not preclude any other gentleman arguing upon that ground. I wished to repeat what it was that I did state, that I might not be accused of having admitted that which I never admitted. 
BEARCROFT 1483 I have received this interruption with the greatest patience, because it is made by a counsel for a man now trying for his life; if it had been made in any other place, and ina civil cause, I could not have orborne instantly to express my astonishment at the gross irregularity of the interruption ; because I conceive it is not only the privilege, but it is absolutely the duty of a counsel, when he is arguing upon the admissibility of evidence, to state that evidence to the Court. If, it can, by any other means, be argued, my learned friend will be so good as tell me how that is to be performed, for I really cane not conceive. 
EYRE 1484 The counsel is to open the nature of the evidence. 
ERSKINE 1485 I am in possession of the judgment of the Court on that which Mr. Bearcroft calls an interruption. 
BEARCROFT 1486 I am certainly aware, that it may be done in that shape of opening the nature of the evidence; but with great submission to the Court, I conceive that was precisely what I was going to do. I do conceive, with great deference, that it would be extremely improper in me to be reading the evidence, from the beginning to the end, under colour that that should be necessary to argue as to the admissibility of it. I de adanit, that it is sufficient; nay, that more ought not to be done than to state the nature of it; but I conceive that the nature of that part of it, which I point out as one of the main grounds of the admissibility of this letter, are certain particular expressions made use of in it. What strikes me, at this moment, is [contained in two lines and a half : “ Nay, I am told a woman, moved and seduced by the instigation of the devil, and traitorously intending, &c. did, in St. James’s- park, take off her patten, and threw it, with all her force, whereby the glass of the state coach was broken, and his majesty put in fear. God save the king; for, if, &c. as Gerrald says,— Be acl y do submit to the Court, that this is important evidence to the very point of the indictment; namely, for the pu se of showing a mischievous intention to the king. Because this is a letter from one of the conspirators to another of the conspirators, exulting in the transaction, enjoying it, and stating it as good news, for his purpose, to his brother conspirator. That is the light, with great submission, in which it strikes me. I conceive that that is an additional ground upon which this letter is admissible. 
BOWER 1487 I should be ashamed to trouble the court with a word Ls this objection, for the sake of the piece of evidence that is now in my hand, because it does not appear, of itself, to be of so much importance as to demand so much attention ; but it will be of very considerable consequence in the course of these trials, if a piece of evidence, offered to the court under the circumstances in which we offer this letter, should not be considered, as good evidence. 
BOWER 1488 I will attend to what your lordship su gested, that the duty of counsel is to open the tendency of the evidence, at the time it is offered and objected to; and, with great deference to my friends who have gone before me, I do not think that they have opened the tendency of that part of this letter, which appears to me to be material, and to be an indisputable ground why it should be received in evidence. 
BOWER 1489 I must beg your lordships to advert to the state of the present cause. We have already proved, as against the pooner, a paper, signed with the name of John Martin, as chairman, at a meeting of the society of which he himself is secretary. This paper was brought home to him by evidence, and by etnch, he, therefore, admits, that Martin was the chairman of that meeting; the date of the letter, which I hold in my hand, is the 22d of January, 1794; it is subsequent to the period of that convention in Scotland, of which we have heard so much, and it is relative to that convention. ‘The letter which I want to read now is from Mr. Martin, who we have proved to be so connected with Mr. Hardy, to their delegate in Scotland, who was at that time, in consequence of the interposition of the civil magistrate, in confinement, as it appears, to encourage him to proceed in these efforts, which he was sent there to attempt, by telling him that subscriptions will now be raised, which will be an assistance to him, and by informing hiim that it may be thought advisable to have another meeting here, in a commodious place, for the purpose of carryin into effect the views of the convention, which the magistracy of that country interrupted. That is the tendency of the greatest part of the letter, which we now offer to the Court; and if we have brought ourselves into the situation of showing, as I trust we have, that Mr. Hardy has admitted Mr. Martin to be chairman of the Corresponding Society ; if we have proved that the object of that society was to accomplish certain purposes; when I say we have proved, I take it we have given evidence to prove it; if we have proved, that the objects of that society were, to carry certain purposes into effect, by means of the convention ; if we show incitement from a person proved to be connected with the prisoner in the way Martin has been proved, to proceed in those steps which are the objects of that convention, and to persevere in those measures, which were the measures used to bring about the ultimate purposes of that convention, we may prove a direct act, done in furtherance of that conspiracy, by showing a direct incitement, by a Jetter in the very words of the overt act charged in this indictment, to persevere, and go on with that conduct, which was to lead to the ultimate end that the society had in view. 
EYRE 1490 I understand that this letter is not proved ever to have come to the hands of Margarot; you call ita letter; it is, in truth, merely a paper, in Martin’s hand-writing. 
BOWER 1491 The argument would, perhaps, be stronger, if it had come to his hands ; but, with great submission to your lordship, it is evidence of the intent of this Mr. Martin to encourage the party, who appears to have been intended to have been addressed by this letter, in the general purposes for which this society has been established, and which they were going to carry into effect; but it is not so strong, to be sure, as if I could prove that it arrived at Margarot’s possession, because, I take it, that would put it out of all doubt; but any letter, written from a conspirator in the connexion we have proved Mr. Martin to be, having proved him to be chairman of that very meeting, the object of this letter being to persevere in these measures, and to forward those purposes, which we have proved the society had in view, and that Martin, the man who writes this letter, particularly had in view, by the transactions at the Globe tavern, is not, I conceive, a recital of any thing that has passed, but a direct incitement to go on with that act, which we are about to prove, as being the act intended by this society to be carried into effect, by the joint or individual efforts of the members of the society. It does appear to me to be material, that we should now know whether or no, when we have established an intimate connexion between Martin and the prisoner, that an act done by Martin, in direct furtherance and prosecution of the main design, should not be admitted as evidence against the prisoner, though we have given evidence, that they were connected in the individual and particular act which is the subject of the evidence that has been offered. I submit to your lordships, that this is evidence which, in this stage of the cause, ought to be received; and it is not for the materiality of this piece of evidence, but for the sake of the principle that we wish to have established. 
LAW 1492 The ground upon which I meant to address your lordships has been, ina great degree, anticipated by what has fallen from Mr. 
LAW 1493 wer
SCOTT 1494 In considering whether any written evidence, in general, is admissible, I will consider, first, what is the relation between the party who wrote this letter, the person to whom it is written, aud the party to be affected by it, —There has been evidence to prove, that there existed in the members of this society, a conspiracy to subvert the government; thea I submit to your lordships, that, having laid that ground, it isin the ordinary course of proceeding to give evidence of the detached acts of any one individual, conducing to the general end and purpuse to be effected by the general conspiracy. 
LAW 1495 Then what is this act? And is it an act: which falls within any of the overt-acts charged upon the face of the indictment
SCOTT 1496 I think it is peculiarly applicable to that overt-act which states that they composed and wrote, and caused to be composed and written, divers books, pamphlets, letters, &c. containing incitements, encouragements, and exhortations, for the purpose of accomplishing this object of holding a convention, for the purpose of deposing and ultimately procuring the death of his majesty. Now is this letter in furtherance of that object? it contains the common incitementsand exhortations of this sort; it encourages him to persevere, and states as a ground why he should persevere, that the toms of the society were Increasing ; that their numbers were increasing; and that their prospect of success was increasing. That being stated (for 1am not at liberty to detail the particular contents of the letter), as the subject and object of the to excite the person to whom it was written, , 
LAW 1497 letter: the only question is, whether such a letter as that, of which it may be predicated, that it contains an exhortation and incitement to this object, is or not to be received in evi dence. I conceive there can be no doubt it is an excitement and exhortation upon this subject, and if it be that it is ad«issible. 
ERSKINE 1498 My lord, unless I mistake the cause, and the stage we are now arrived at in it, this is novel. I think I may call ita phenomenon in the history of trials for high treason, and in the practice of a court of justice. My lord, standing here towards the middle of the second day, I must appeal to the honour of the Court, and to the candour of the bar, whether we who are of counsel for the prisoner have not been extremely ready,— perhaps, readier than we might altogether justify to our client in a capital case,—in permitting the reception of evidence, having troubled your lordships with no arguments, having asked hardly a single question of any witness that has been sworn. I am persuaded, when your lordships recollect the course that this cause has taken, that you cannot but see that we should have made no sort of objection to the reading of this letter, had it contained nothing more than my learned friend Mr. Garrow very decently, in my opinion, and very properly stated to the Court, considering and properly considering, that though the Court might be involved in the difficulty in reading a part of a letter, which part could in no instance be evidence against the prisoner, yet that the technicality of the evidence might unfortunately call upon your lordships to direct a jury to do that which a judge cannot direct a jury to do, because human nature will not permit the accomplishment of it—to discharge from their minds the recolJection of what they have heard. My friend did, therefore, properly not even open the generality of that part of the letter; but what have I in this cause to do with any thing that Mr. Martin might write, and which may appear for any thing I know to be an unpublished letter in Mr. Martin’s therefore upon no principle of Jaw to be evidence at all. I conceived that we were debating it as far as related to the prosecution of what was called a plot and conspiracy ; namely, that which was published in all the newspapers, and which your lordships have been engaged two daysin hearing read. [must be a fool to stand here and object to reading a paper which contains nothing more than what the jury have been employed two days of their precious time in hearing; but so it went on, and at last Mr. Serjeant Adair said, that, which ifit had been said at first, I would have waved my objection, and the jury should have heard the letter, and that part would have been crossed out, or the officer would have been desired not to read it; and I defy any man of common sense to say he could suppose I should object to it. Do not let any Man explain away that which I did say, and that which the honourable and learned serjeant stated, with the sense that belongs to him, and the humanity which, I trust, will ever accompany that sense. He stated that he did not mean to insist upon the jury hearing those lines read: he thought they ought not to hear ahem. 
ERSKINE 1499 Then cames the next learned counsel, and he makes pot a single observation upon apy ossession, and other part of the letter which is stated to he. in furtherance of that which is called the conspiracy; but he fastens upon that, and proposes to read that which the counsel whe went before him admitted was mo evidence against my client. I stood up to object, not to interrupt. I stand here to object whenever there is a legal objection open tome. I had your lordships j ent for the foundation of my objection; but my friend paid no regard to your lordships judgment: after I was possessed of your lordshipsiudement; he went on and read the very words aguinst the reading of which I objected; and having done so, he kindly tells me that as J am counsel in a criminal case, he receives my interruption with a gentleness with which he would not receive such an interruption in a civil cause. He says this after he has dane that which is illegal, and has not been stopped in the doing it, though I objected to rt, and was in possession of the judgment of the a 4 i 
ERSKINE 1500 My lords, this is no trifling matter, gi me leave to say, 1 stand here for the ike of an innocent man; and I stand here fur the law and constitution of England, and I wild suffer nothing to be done while I stand bers that is not consonant to both. Then where are we got to now in the debate? We ape got to that which fills me with alarm and apprehension ; it is an object of 2 magnitude so great, so mighty, and what I am so unaccustomed to consider, that I hardly know how to grapple with it, or how to address myself to your lardships. 
ERSKINE 1501 ttis truly stated too by the learned serjeant that what the crown profess lo make eut by the evidence they haye been offering a0 your lordships for a great season is, that Mr. was engaged ina conspiracy. Why is that unfortunate man at the bar to be the only victim of a conspiracy? I do not mean the only one; there are eight or ten indicted with him. How many thousands of his majesty’s subjects are meant to be hrought to this place I cannot tell; fer the conspiracy that is .alleged goes to the members of every ene of the societies. I say, in my judgment, epom the evidence that is before the Court, man who has been a member of these Comesponding Societies; who has been a member of this Constitutional Society; every man who has been connected with those acts, if the acts constitute a conspiracy to subvert the government, is liable to be put into the same Situation with Mr. Hardy; and any thing thas is written by any one person belonging to either of these societies would be eq avidence against him. 
ERSKINE 1502 The whole distinction seems to be this, and that distinction seems misunderstued. agree with Mr. Solicitor General in what be said, with regard to lord Stafford’s case, founding itself as far as relates to acts. Now if this had been within the scope of the business under examination, an act done by Margarot and by Martin, i shall admit thet such act done would be evidence against the prisoner; but I am abjecting to a letter, more especially a letter that never found its way to the person to whom it was written; that it was ever intended for Mr. Margarot, as far as the evidence goes, we do not know; but by the contents of which letter we are suught to be affected. 
ERSKINE 1503 Noy there is only ene thing I am anxious about. I wish to submit it to the justice and to the discretion of this Court. Suppose part of this letter is evidence, and part of it is aot on ae that part which is mot evidence to 
ERSKINE 1504 It happens every day that four lodships direct part of an answer to ax interrogatory to be in a court of equity; but you will act allow other parts to be readl, because they are not admissible evidence. Now all that I ob, ject to is, the reading this account of an old woman throwing her pattea at she king’s coach ; it is something 0 perfectly ridiculous ; 
ERSKINE 1505 aman’s writing such a trurppery eneodote as that, should affect a man trying for his life in such a case as this, it would be an imault to suppose; but at the same time it . 3 te me to be a dangerous precedent, to allow aay thing to be read as evidence which has no connexion with the eransaction before ithe Court, but is mere fippancy, which she writer of a Ietter happens to put into it; which letter has in it matter that may became evidence. 
EYRE 1506 This has e into a length of discussion ; butIblame nobody, as there was some differenoe of opinion in the Court upoa the former occasion ; therefore it required that this question should be more fully discussed. 
EYRE 1507 I agree with Mr. Bearcroft, that he has stated truly what the nature of this questian is; namely, that if this were merely a trial for a conspiracy, this would be evidence against one of the parties in that conspiracy, because the question, whether this prisoner is to be reached upon the apecific charge against him, is, undoubtedly, a question, whether he is to be reached -by that medium; aad if the medium is once established, that question arises, upon which I will say no more at presant. 
EYRE 1508 It is perfectly clear that in the case of a Conspiracy, the general evidence of she thing canspired is given in evidence, and then the party who is at present brought before a court of justice to answer for it is to be affected for his shase in it; the question then is, whether a paper under the hand of a person, who is proved to be one of the conspirators, shall be Teceived in evidence, where it ts nothing more ban a paper under his hand? For, as I take Ht, as this case stands, it is not a letter sent to Margarot. There is no preef that Margarot nd recerve any such agen pe aia it may be a paper merely writtem pri ly Martin, who is the person im whose hapdquestion This is of the nature of confession, and writing it is stated to be, and may never have gone out of his hands. The question is, wher ther under these circumstances such a paper is to be admitted in evidence, ina case in which another person pow stands at the bar; and, I confess, that this does not appear to me to be suffidently distinguished from the case which we just now determined, o satisfy my mand that it ought to be received in evidence. 
EYRE 1509 It is undoubtedly true, that the general plot is to be made out by proving the transactions of others, to which the prisoner at the bar may not be immediately a pers but thea, bow is itto be proved? Is it to be proved by the mere acknowledgment of theac other parties, end so made use of against the prisoner now at the bar? For instance, here isa conspiracy charged. Sup; & witness should come and say, J heard Thelwall sey that he was engaged i auch a cons| : and I heard Martin say he was engaged im such a conspiracy ; endIheard Margaret say he was engaged io mich a conspiracy. My present apprehension is, that that would be extremely good evidence personally against the parties, who said it to prove against them individually, that they were cnncerned in that conspiracy, but that it would be no evidence whatever agaiast third persons, a8 was the case on ford StaGord’s trial. A witness praved that he heard A. B. and C. converse upen the subject ofa conspiracy; that is a direct proof that ahese three persons conspired, and there the conversation of que is evidence against the ether, and so on; that is evidence of a transaction, a fact, not hear-say evidence; and not evidence of a party’s acknowledgment, oaly inasmuch as it is an acknowledg. ment by one in the presence of the others, they acquiescing, and therefore becomes distinct and proper evidence. Sut I have ala ways taken it that with regard to these persanal acknowledgments of having meant to in. citey—for that isthe nature of this letter—J have always taken it that that was proper evidence, if the party who was to be affected by it happened to stand at the bar to answer for it: but if another person was indicted by himself, that there could be no evidence received against that person, but the evideace of facts proved by the witnesses, who peeve the existence of the facts in regular evidence: confessional evidence is ad hominem only. Lfit happens that a matter of fact is evidence against A, by evidence of the truth of that fact, other thay the confession of A, that does also become evidence against B, from the circumstance of B being connected ee the plot, and B being bound by al! that A has done. But the course that has been observed in the Stade Trials that I have read, bas been that confessions have been made evidemes against the individuals only who confessed. Bow thing more; that has been considered as evi. dence only against the party, and is not te bo received where that party is not the person before the Court. 
MACDONALD 1510 On the last question before the Court I confined what I said to the exact circumstance of the case, namely, that the bare relation of acts by one of several persons to whom the conspiracy is imputed to a perfect stranger to that conspiracy, is no more than an admission which may possibly affect himself, but cannot possibly affect any of his co-conspirators, it not being an act done in the prosecution of that conspiracy. But, I confess, there appears to me a material distinction in this case. This is a paper which is addressed by one of several conspirators to another of those conspirators; it is introduced as subservient to the proof of the general nature and tendency of that conspiracy, which is alleged and endeavoured to be proved as the foundation of affecting the prisoner with a share in that conSpiracy. 
MACDONALD 1511 Now it seems to me that one conspirator addressing a paper to another conspirator, having relation to that conspiracy (not merely a bare description to a stranger), that one of them addressing that paper to the other is an act complete in that single conspirator, although that paper should be intercepted, or although it never should reach that person for whose perusal it was intended; that distinguishes this from the other case ; it is a different act in one, though it does not reach the other in that sense; it is an act by one of the conspirators, which in order to show the nature and tendency of that conspiracy may be read as against any other. 
HOTHAM 1512 I remain of opinion that in the last case, the letter then offered in evidence ought not to have been suffered to be read. That letter, however, I consider as a very different letter from this; it was enclosing some songs, supposed to have heen sung at a meeting, sent to a totally indifferent person, and that was all that it contained. This letter is written by a man who has been proved to be the chairman of the meeting at the Globe-tavern ; it is stated to be written to, though not received by, Margarot, who has been proved to be the delegate sent by that meeting into Scotland ; and it is stated to contain matters respecting his particular mission to Edinburgh. It 1s stated to contain matters of incitement, and encouragement to him to proceed in the cause in which he was engaged ; namely, in the cause in which he was engaged by the procurement, by the consent, and by the direction of that meeting in 
HOTHAM 1513 London; and that meeting in London has been proved to be composed of the prisoner at the bar, of the writer of this letter, and his correspondent to whom it was intended to be sent, together with many others. 
HOTHAM 1514 Now, therefdre, I do consider this as strong evidence, to show that one of that meeting so blended together as they are with the prisoner, :e such a letter tending to incite and encourage their own delegate to proceed in the business, upon which they had particularly sent him, and for which they had especially commissioned him and empowered him to act, ought to be admitted as evidence to prove the sense of these conspirators, who were also proved to have been together upon that day. 
BULLER 1515 The case to which I alluded just now was, that of William lord Russell, where my lord Howard, in his examination, goes very much at large into evidence of what passed between him and lord Shaftesbury; and in parts of that evidence he goes on to say that he supposed these thin: were told to lord Russell; that lord Russell properly objects to: he says it ishearsay, and does not affect him, but it is part of the evidence which is given, and you find much relied upon by the chief justicet in summing up to the jury, with a view to that question which I just now stated, as the first which presses in point of order, and which question, in my opinion, is always to be distinct from the second question ; namely, whether it does or does not immediately affect the prisoner. The evidence given there by lord Howard is, that in a conversation with lord Shaftesbury, he asked him what forces he had, to which lord Shaftesbury answered, that he had enough, that ten thousand brisk boys were gendy to follow him whenever he held up his er. hen this is summed 'up, the chief justice states it to the jury, repeating these words, as evidence of a consult, but that it does not affect lord Russell. 
BULLER 1516 Then how stands the case here? The first question to be made out is, that there was some conspiracy to affect the life of the king; —To make out that question you must go into evidence of what was done by other persons. When established, I agree that that would not affect the prisoner, but it is necessary first to show that here was such a conspiracy on foot, and then you go on to the second question, to see whether there is or is not evidence to prove that this prisoner was acting a part in that conspiracy. Now it seems to me that the question will stand a little clearer, if we suppose that a conspiracy of the nature contended for on the part of the prosecution had gone on without the intervention of such a convention, as has been here proved, by persons who were in the habit of committing their resolutions to writing, if such a combination had existed, how in the nature of things could it be made out, but by the declarations and the conversations of those who were parties toit? And it seems to me that the way in which my brother Adair considered this question, is a material one; suppose an equivocal expression were used, should not I prove by conversation of persons there how they understood it; it is evidence that they meant that their plan should go to such an extent, then it becomes a secondary question, whether the prisoner so understood it or not ; it is an expression equivocal, and if it is proved on the part of the prosecution that some meant to go to that extent, it is open to the prisoner to say it was not so meant by me, nor did I so understand it. But the question is now not upon the effect of the evidence, but whether it ought or not to be received; and inasmuch as it goes to the existence ofa conSpiracy, itseems to me that it must be recited. What effect it will have must be considered hereafter. 
GROSE 1517 I am of opinion this evidence must be received for the purpose of showing that there was a conspiracy, and of what nature that conspiracy was. In this case the address has just now been produced and read; and in that address it appears that Martin was the chairman, the prisoner the secretary, and that there was a correspondence, both between the prisoner and Margarot, and between Martin and Margarot; that complicates or implicates these three persons in a business of this sort. Then is it not very material for us to hear for the purpose of showing the nature of the conspiracy, the extent and the intention of the parties, what one conspirator writes to the uther, respecting these very acts that are done in the course of transactions relative to this very plan? And when itis said that this is merely aconfession ora writing, I think it is more because we know very well that in many circumstances of this sort it has been determined that, scribere est agere ; and the writing here isan act, and it is such ap act as may show the extent of the plan, that there was a plan, it may show for any thing I know the intention of the parties to that plan. I confess, therefore, I am of opinion that this evidence ought to be read.

I thank you, my valuable friend, for the kind concern you show; butI wish the society may not forget me altogether; however, should they, I am determined to pursue the same line of conduct even if I must pursue it alone. I will, however, remark to youin private, and this letter is meant as a private one, and you may make what use you think fit of it, that the Sheffield Society have behaved far differently from our own, towards their delegate, and even towards his family. Ifyou publish my trial, it might be necessary to place a print of my handsome figure in front, if so, Mrs. Margarot can furnish you with a miniature, whence an engraving can be taken; if that is done, pray Ict the engraver put into my hand the paper, containing the questions to the lord justice Clerk, and let the last of them be legible, viz. Did you not say, that the mob would be the better for losing a little blood ?

If ever a crisis arrived that required the exertions of the people to stop the torrent of corruption, infamy, and despotism that seems likely to overwhelm them, it is the present. In God’s name, ther, let us use these exertions. We are called upon by every thing that is dear to us, as men and as Christians. The cause of truth and liberty must finally be omnipotent; therefore doubt not that the glorious reign of liberty and equality will ere Jong be established; and modern governments, with every appen of wickedness and corruption, will flee, in time, from their genial influence, as beasts of prey to their dens of rapine and darkness from the rising sun. The London Corresponding Society have beheld with indignation the rapid advances of despotism in Britain, and are ready cordially to unite with every other society in the three kingdoms, who have for their object a full and effectual sg ae tion of the people; they therefore have deputed six of their members to meet six of the members of the Society for Constitutional Information, to form a committee of correspondence and co-operation. This committee meets regularly twice a week, at No. 2, Beaufort Buildings, Strand, where any member delegated by your society will meet with every information required. We inclose you a few of our resolutions entered into at our general meeting, on the 14th of April, which will be sufficiently explanatory of ovr sentiments and views.

GARROW 1587 “Citizen Hardy, It is with great satisfaction we view the manly conduct of you and gour colleagues, especially when surrounded, as you are, by a domineering aristocracy, who, notwithstanding their great bluster, are but chicken-hearted: witness our Norfolk Quixotes, who, after being completely foiled at the county meeting, were determined to subscribe to support an armed aristocracy. But pray tell it not in the metropolis, that a noble marquis subscribed no more than 200. and another high-pensioned lord but 100.; an alderman ‘and leader, and very fierce for church and king, the enormous sum of 201. these are the men who are ready to spend their lives and fortunes—But enough of such privileged beings. We should be glad to know whether the Friends of the People consent to a convention, and whether they will take an active part. — mm bm we : aPlease to accept ofa few of our bills, We should esteem ita favour that you would send us a few of your late Declarations. ty “ P.

GARROW 1590 “ Sir, I have repeatedly seen your name in the newspapers, as secretary to a certain’ institution called the London -Corresponding Society. But from my inquiries in the coun try, I have not yet been able to acquire a knowledge of the rules of the society, nor the’ 
GARROW 1591 ecise purpose for which it has been estalished. If their design is to increase the knowledge of the community, I really think’ it laudable and seasonable, and should be glad to avail myself of their information. I have therefore troubled you with this letter, requesting some account of the rules of the society, the object they have in view, and the means they pursue to obtain it. Any information of this sort would be extremely gratifying to, sir, your most humble servant, ‘

GARROW 1594 “ Mr. Hardy, No. 9, Piccadilly, London. 
GARROW 1595 ‘ “ Post paid. Fellow Citizen, In answer to your letter dated the 12th ult. Iam desired to inform’ you, the London Corresponding Society have in view not only the glorious design of increasing the knowledge of the community, bi of redressing their grievances. This Rite hope to do by straining every nerve in union with other societies already established, and establishing, in every part of the kingdom, to procure universal suffrage and annual parliaments, as the only likely means to annihilate the present most abominable system of corruption, and to stop the rapid advances of despotism—a monster whose hideous features" need only be exposed to render it an object of: universal terror and detestation, but whose gaudy trappings have too long dazzled the eyes of our countrymen. 
GARROW 1596 “ To expose vice, to paint virtue in its true colours, to acquaint our fellow citizens with their dearest rights, the rights of mun; and, by a brotherly union, give them an opportunity of demanding those rights, are the ‘ means we use; and we doubt not, but in exertin those means, we are doing our duty to Go and our country ; for, as Pope says, : “ Jove fixt it certain, that whatever day “ Made man a slave, took half his worth away. 
GARROW 1597 “ We invite you, and your fellow citizens, ta join with us in the same glorious cause. From us you may depend on every information and. assistance ; the mode of obtaining which, you, ‘will shortly learn by a circular letter.

GARROW 1599 Herewith you receive a few of the proceedings of our last general meeting. (Indorsed) “ Copy of answer to Hereford. 
GARROW 1600 Inow propose to read a letter from a society at Sheffield, addressed to the prisoner; it does not appear that any part of it 1s in his hand-writing ; it is found in the possession of Thelwall, who, as your lordship recollects, appears to have been in some instances an agent of that London Corresponding Society of which Hardy was aectelaty 
GARROW 1601 Mr. Erskine. The principle upon which the last piece of evidence was admitted was vel distinctly stated by your lordships, that it might be evidence to show a conspiracy so called, yet would not go to affect the prisoner, unless it could be brought home to him. The only remark I make upon this is, how does it appear to be the same Sheffield Society with which this society was in correspondence? Is it written in the same hand-writing? Does it profess to be written by the same person who betore corresponded with the prisoner? Mr. Garrow. We do not state this is the Sheffield society with which they correpanded; I state it to be from a society at Sheffield, with which town they were in correspondence, signed by a person purporting to be a secretary ; but if my friends object to it, we will not trouble them to argue it. 
ERSKINE 1602 I certainly do object to it. 
EYRE 1603 I think this letter is iy a different situation from the other. It is a Jetter purporting to come from one of these societies ; it is addressed to the prisoner, and it is found in the hands of a person affected by the evidence, at least to involve him in this conspiracy.

We are not in the least intimidated in Sheffield, 1 as we can call and hold a public meeting whenever circumstances render the same necessary: besides in the house where I reside, we have a commodious room, where the society can peaceably meet in rotation

GARROW 1617 “ Since the above period, however, we are sorry to say, several of our members have been persecuted, and that in a most wanton manner; and the above resolution (which if duly putin force, would, we humbly apprehend, have the happy effect of emboldeni those who haye already come forward, and ; encouraging others who have not yet taken ; any active part to unite their efforts in the general cause) has never yet been attended to, 
GARROW 1618 “ We therefore humbly move, that the cone vention take into consideration the above pare ticulars, and consider what measures may be most conducive towards the performance of the obligation we lye under, in consequence of that resolution, and thereby show to the world, that we are not unmindful of those who have already suffered, or may in future s 4in their country’s cause

They have a just sense of the confidence that you have placed in them, and of the generosity and disinterestedness of your offer, but they cannot think that it is an offer they should accept. The eminent services which have been rendered to the public by your invaluable writings, have never yet met with an adequate reward, and they think that it would be an extreme injustice to deprive you of any benefits which might be derived from their sale; for itis but reasonable, that those who are possessed of literary talents, and who employ them toPromote the happiness of the community to which they belong, and to mankind at large, should receive those advantages which may be obtained by their writings, and which may be enjoyed with integrity and honour. But though the society decline the offer which you have. been pleased to make them, they cannot do it, without,.at the same time, con. gratulating you upon the consciousness which you must possess of having contributed, by your writings, to the illumination of so many millions of human beings, in this country, America, an in other nations, on subjects of the highest importance to the universal freedom and happiness of mankind.

BOWER 1676 Have you corresponded with him 
LAUZUN 1677 I have received notes from him. 
BOWER 1678 And answered them 
LAUZUN 1679 No. 
BOWER 1680 How do you know the notes came from him? has he afterwards told you that they were his notes
LAUZUN 1681  Becausedelivered things according to his order, therefore supposed them to come from him; but I never saw him write, so as to take particular notice. 
BOWER 1682 Have you ever talked with him about those notes, or of things that were sent in consequence 
LAUZUN 1683 I do not know that I have, 
BOWER 1684 Did you publish, at any time, for Mr. Paine, a work, intituled, “ Rights of Man

LAUZUN 1689 I believe it is one of the books that I might publish. 
ERSKINE 1690 Do you swear to that book, that it is one you published 
LAUZUN 1691 I cannot swear that it is; there were a great number sold that were not sold by me.

LAUZUN 1696 Mr. Chapman printed part of it. Of the first part of the Rights of Man, Mr. Chapman printed the whole. This is the second art.

LAUZUN 1698 No, I am only the publisher, 
WHITE 1699 The man is dead that bought it, and I must call a witness to prove hi hand-writing. That was proved in a court of justice. 
BOWER 1700 I have the record of a conviction, in which Paine was convicted: this witness was examined upon his oath there, and I can prove what he swore then, which I submit will be evidence. 
ERSKINE 1701 That was the king against Mr. Paine; thisis the king against Mr. Hardy. 
GARROW 1702 I think I am entitled, at present, to read this as evidence to go to the jury ; I know it is open to the other side to show that this is not the Rights of Man reeognized by this society
LAUZUN 1703 We can carry it farther. 
EYRE 1704 The rule of evidence requires that you should carry it farther.

GARROW 1730 Letter of Thomas Paine, to the People of France. Published and distributed gratis by the London Corresponding Society. 
GARROW 1731 “ Paris, September 25. (First Year of the Republic.) 
GARROW 1732 “ Fellow Citizens; I receive, with affectionate Eratitade, the honour which the late National Assembly has conferred upon me, by adopting me a citizen of France; and the ditional honour of being elected by my fellow-citizens a member of the National Convention. Happily impressed, as I am, by those testimonies of respect shown towards me as an individual, I feel my felicity increased by seeing the barrier broken down that divided patriotism by spots of earth, and limited citizenship to the soil, like vegetation. 
GARROW 1733 “Had those honours been conferred in an hour of national tranquillity, they would have afforded no other means of showing my affection, than to have accepted and enjoyed them ; but they come accompanied with circumstances that give me the honourable portunity of commencing my citizenship in the stormy hour of difficulties. I come not to enjoy repose. Convinced that the cause of France is the cause of all mankind, and that as liberty cannot be purchased by a wish, I gladly share with you the dangers and honours necessary to success. 
GARROW 1734 “1 am well aware that the moment of any inp change, such as that accomplished on the 10th of August, is unavoidably the moment of terror and confusion, The mind, highly agitated by hope, suspicion, and apprehension, continues without rest till the change be accomplished. But let us now look calmly and confidently forward, and success is certain. It is no longer the paltr cause of kings, or of this, or of that individual, that calls France and her armies into action. It is the great cause of aru. Itis the establishment of a new era, that shall blot despotism from the earth, and fix, on the lasting principles of peace and citizenship, the great republic of man. 
GARROW 1735 t:has been my fate to have borne a share in the commencement and complete establishment of one revolution (I meafi the revolution of America). The success and events of that revolution are encouraging to us. The ey. and ianpinesy: sat have since jowed to that country, have amply rewarded her for all the hardships she endured, and for all the dangers she encountered. 
GARROW 1736 “ The principles on which that revolution began, -have extended themselves to Europe ; and an over-ruling Providence is repesereing the Old World by the principles of the New. The gah ere Som a Asse other pats of , did not admit of her carrying those principles beyond her own situation. It 1s to the peculisr honour of France, that she now raixes the seumiard of liberty for all nations; and in fighting hes own battles, contends for the rights of all mankind. 
GARROW 1737 he same spirit of fortitude that insured success to America, will insure it to France, for it is impossible to conquer a nation determined to be free! The military circumstances that now unite themselves to France, are suc! as the despots of the earth know nothing of, and can’ form no caleulation upon know not what it is to fight: against a nation, They have only been accustomed to make war’ upon each other, and they know from systeny and practice, how to calcilate the probable success of despot against despot; and here’ their knowledge and their experience ends. 
GARROW 1738 “ But in a contest like the present, a new and boundless variet yer circumstances arises, that deranges all such customary calculations. When: a whole nation acts as an army, the despot knows not the extent of the power against which he contends. New armies rise’ against him with the necessity of the moment. It is then that the difficulties of an-invading enemy multiply, as in the former case they diminished ; and he finds them at their height when he expected them to end. 
GARROW 1739 he only war that has any mouarity oF circumstances with the present, is the late revolution-war in America. Qa her part, as it now is in France, it was a war of the whole nation
LAUZUN 1740 There it was that the enemy, by beginning to conquer, put himself in a condition of being conquered. His first victories prepared him for defeat. He advanced till he could not retreat, and found himself in the midst of a nation of armies. 
GARROW 1741 “ Were it now to be proposed to the Austrians and Prussians to escort them into the middle of France, and there leave them to make the most of such a situation, they would see too much into the danger of it to accept the offer, and the same dangers would attend them could they arrive there by any other means. Where then is the military policy of their attempting to obtain by force, that which they would refuse by choice? But to reason with despots is throwing reason away. The best of arguments is a vigurous preparation. 
GARROW 1742 “Man is ever a stranger to the ways by which Providence regulates the order of things. The interference of foreign despots may serve to introduce into their own enslaved countries the principles they come to oppose, Liberty and equality are blessings too great to be the inheritance of Frauce alone. It is honour to her to be their first champion ; and she may now say to her enemies, with a mighty voice, ‘O! ye Austrians, ye Prus‘slans! ye who now turn your bayonets “against us; it is for all Europe; it is tor alt mankind, and not for France alone, that sho “raises the standard of Liberty and Equality. 
GARROW 1743 he public cause has hitherto suffered from the contradictions contained in the constitution of the former Constituent Assembly. Those contradictions have served to divide the opinions of individuals at home, and to obscure the great principles of the revolution in other countries. But when those contradictions shall be removed, and the constitution be made conformable to the declaration of rights; when the bagatelles of monarghy, royalty, regency, and hereditary succession, shall be exposed, with all their absurdities, a new ray of light will be thrown over the world, and the revolution will derive new strength by being universally understood. The scene that now opens itself to France extends far beyond the houndaries of her own dominions. Every nation is becoming her colleague, and every court is become her enemy. It is now the cause of all nations against the cause of all courts. The terror that despotism felt, clandestinely begot a confederation of despots; and their attack upon France was produced by their fears at home. 
GARROW 1744 “ In entering on this great scene, greater than apy nation has yet been called to act in, let us say to the agitated mind, be calm. Let us punish by instructing, rather than by revenge. Jet us begin the new era by a greatness of friendship, and hail the approach of union and success. Your fellow citizen, homas Parner.

LAUZUN 1752 A work intitled Rights of Man. 
GARROW 1753 Did you print one or two parts of that work

GARROW 1759 Look at these two books, and tell me whether you believe these to be copies printed by you 
LAUZUN 1760 I pened the first part entirely. 
GARROW 1761 How far did you proceed in printing the second part 
LAUZUN 1762 I think I printed as far ee leur K, that is, I finished what we call the letter or signature of sheet I, which includes the 128th page; the larger edition, I had the copy of almost the whole of the remaining fart, and my people had composed it, or set it up in the type, but I did not conclude it, hat did you do with that part you did not finish ?—Returned it into the hands of Mr. Paine by a servant of mine. 
GARROW 1763 After the book was completed, did you ever converse with Mr. Paine about it
LAUZUN 1764 I do not think I saw Mr. Paine om the business after the work was quite finished. 
GARROW 1765 “ Can then Mr. Burke produce the English constitution? 1f he cannot, wo may fairly conclude, that though it has been so muc! talked about, no such thing as a constitution exists, or ever did exist, and consequently that the people have yet a constitution to form. 
GARROW 1766 (Page 59, Bvo. and page 25, 12mo. editions.)—“ A government on the principles on which constitutional governments arising out of society are established, cannot have the right of altering itself. If it had, it would be arbitrary. It might make itself what it pleased; and wherever such a right is set up, it shows there is no constitution. The act by which the English parliament empowered itself to sit seven years, shows there is no constitution in England. It might, by the same self-authority, have sat any greater number of years, or for life. he Bill which the present Mr. Pitt brought into parliament some years ago, to reform parliament, was on the same erroneous principle. The right of reform is in the nation in its original character, and the constitutional method would be by a general convention elected for the purse. There is, moreover, a paradox in the idea of vitiated bodies reforming themselves. 
GARROW 1767 (Page 63, 8vo. and 27, 12mo. editions.)— “ Much is to be learned from the French constitution. Conquest and tyranny transplanted themselves with William the Conqueror from Normandy into England, and the country is yet disfigured with the marks, May then the example of all France contribute to regenerate the freedom which a province of it dee stroyed !" 
GARROW 1768 (Page 161, 8vo. and page 74, 12mo. editions.}—“ The two modes of government which prevail in the world, are, first, government by election and representation : secondly, poreenmnent by hereditary succession. The former is generally known by the name of republic; the latter by that of monarchy and aristocracy. 
GARROW 1769 hose two distinct and opposite forms, erect themselves on the two distinct and posite bases of reason and ignorance
LAUZUN 1770 As the exercise of government recite talents and abilities, and as talents and abilities cannot have hereditary descent, it is evident that hereditary succession requires a belief from man, to which his reason cannot subscribe, and which can only be established upon his ignorance ; and the more ignorant any country is, the better it is fitted for this species of government. 
GARROW 1771 (Page 165, 8vo. and page 76, 12mo. editions.)—“ From the revolutions of America and France, and the symptoms that have appeared in other countries, it is evident that the opinion of the world is changed with respect to systems of government, and that revolutions are not within the compass of political calculations. The progress of time and circumstances, which men assign to the accomplishment of great changes, is too mechanical to measure the force of the mind, and the rapidity of reflection, by which revolutions are generated : all the old governments have received a shock from those that already appear, and which were once more improbable, and are a greater subject of wonder, than a general revolution in Europe would be now. 
GARROW 1772 “ When we survey the wretched condition of man under the monarchical and hereditary systems of government, dragged from his home by one power, or driven by another, and impoverished by taxes more than by enemies, it becomes evident that those systems are bad, and that a general revolution in the principle and construction of governments is necessary. 
GARROW 1773 “ What is government more than the management of the affairs of a nation? It is not, and from its nature cannot be, the property of any particular man or family, but of the whole community, at whose expense it is supported ; and though by force or contrivance it has been usurped into an inheritance, the usurpation cannot alter the right of things. Sovereignty, as a matter of right, appertains to the nation only, and not to any individual ; and a nation has at all times an inherent indefeasible right to abolish any form of governMent it finds inconvenient, and establish such as accords with its interest, disposition, and happiness. The romantic and barbarous distinction of mer into kings and subjects, though it may suit the condition of courtiers, cannot that of citizens ; and is exploded by the principle upon which governments are now founded. Every citizen is a member of the sovereignty, and, as such, can acknowledge no personal subjection ; and his obedience can be only to the laws. 
GARROW 1774 “ When men think of what government is, they must necessarily suppose it to possess a knowledge of all the objects and matters upon which its authority is to be exercised. In this view of government, the republican system, as established by America and France, operates to embrace the whole of a nation; and the knowledge necessary to the interest of all the parts, is to be found in the centre, which the parts by representation form: but the old governments are on a construction that excludes knowledge as well as happiness; government by monks, who know nothing of the world beyond the walls ofa convent, is as consistent as government by kings. 
GARROW 1775 “What were formerly called revolutions, were little more than a change of persons, or an alteration of local circumstances. They rose and fell like things of course, and had nothing in their existence or their fate that could influence beyond the spot that produced them. But what we now see in the world, from the revolutions of America and France, is a renovation of the natural order of things, a system of principles as universal as truth and the existence of man, and combinin, moral with political happiness and nation: prosperity. 
GARROW 1776 1, Men are born and always continue free, and equal in respect of their rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public utility. 
GARROW 1777 “ 2. The end of all political associations is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man ; and these rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance of oppression. 
GARROW 1778 “3. The nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty ; nor can any INDIVIDUAL, Or ANY BODY OF MEN, be entitled to any authority which is not expressly derived from it. , 
GARROW 1779 (Page 171, 8vo. and page 78, 12mo. editions. —“ As it is not difficult to perceive; from the enlightened state of mankind, that hereditary governments are verging to their decline, and that revolutions on the broad basis of national sovereignty, and government by representation, are making their way in Europe, it would be an act of wisdom to anti cipate their approach, and produce revolutions by reason and accommodation, rather than commit them to the issue of convulsions. 
GARROW 1780 “ From what we now sce, nothing of reform in the political world ought to be held improbable. It is an age of revolutions, in which every thing may be looked for. The intrigue of courts, by which the system of war is kept up, may provoke a contederation of nations to abolish it: and an European congress, to patronize the progress of free government, and promote the civilization of nations with each other, is an event nearer in probability, than once were the revolutions and alliance of France and America. 
GARROW 1781 [The following passages were read from the Second Part of the “ Rights of Man.} 
GARROW 1782 (Page 21, 8vo. edition.)—“ All hereditary vernment is, in its nature, tyranny
LAUZUN 1783 An Reritable crown, or an heritable throne, or by what other fanciful name such things may be called, have no other significant explanation than that mankind are heritable property. To inherit a government is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds. 
GARROW 1784 (Page 27, 8vo. edition.}—“ How irrational then isthe hereditarysystem, which establishes channels of power, in company with which wisdom refuses to flow
LAUZUN 1785 By continuing this absurdity, man is perpetually in contradiction with himself’; he accepts, for a king, or a chief magistrate, or a legislator, a person whom he would not elect for a constable. 
GARROW 1786 (Page 47, 8vo. edition
LAUZUN 1787 “ This convention met at Philadelphia, in May, 1787, of which General Washington was elected president. He was not, at that time, connected with any of the state governments, or with con He delivered up his commission when the war ended, and since then had lived a private citizen. 
GARROW 1788 “ The convention went deeply into all the subjects; and having, after a variety of debate ain investigation, agreed among themselves upon the several parts of a federal constitution, the next question was, the manner of giving it authority and practice. For this purpose they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, send for a Dutch stadtholder, or a German elector ; but they referred the whole matter to the sense and interest of the country. 
GARROW 1789 “ They first directed, that the proposed constitution should be published. Secondly, that each state shoul, elect a convention, expressly for the purpose of taking it into consideration, and of ratifying or rejecting it ; and that as soon as the approbation and ratification of any nine states should be given, that those states should proceed to the election of their proportion of members to the new federal government, and that the operation of it should then begin, and the former federal government cease. 
GARROW 1790 (Page 52, 8vo. edition.“ The history of the Edwards and the Henries, and up to the commencement of the Stuarts, exhibits as many instances of tyranny as could be acted within the limits to which the nation had restricted it. The Stuarts endeavourcd to 
GARROW 1791 8 those limits, and their fate is well known. In all those instances, weseenothing of a constitution, but only of restrictions, or assumed power. 
GARROW 1792 “After this another William, descended from the same stock, and claiming from the same origin, gained possession ; and, of the two evils, James and William, the nation preferred what it thought the least; since, from circumstances, it must take one. The act, called the Bill of Rights, comes here into view, What is it but a bargain, which the parts of the government made with each other, to divide powers, profits, and privileges: you shall have 30 much, and I will have the rest; and, with respect to the nation, it suid, for your share, YOU shall have the right of petitioning. This being the case, the Bill of Rights is, more properly, a bill of wrongs, and of insult. As to whatis called the convention parliament, it was a thing that made itself, and then made the authority by which it acted. A few persons got together, and called themselves by that name. Several of them had never been elected, and none of them for the purpose. 
GARROW 1793 “From the time of William a species of vernment arose, issuing out of this coalition ill of Rights ; and more so, since the corruption introduced at the Hanover succession, by the agency of Walpole; that can be described by no other name than a despotic legislation. Though the parts may embarrass each other, the sinle has no bounds; and the only right it acknowledges, out of itself, is the right of petitioning. Where then is the constitution, either that gives, or that restrains power ? “Itis not because a part of the government is elective, that makes it less a despotism, if the persons so elected possess afterward, as a parliament, unlimited powers. Election, in this case, becomes separated from representation, and the candidates are candidates for despotism. 
GARROW 1794 “ I cannot believe that any nation, reasoning on its own rights, would have thought of calling those things a constitution, if the cry of constitution had not been sct up by the government. 
GARROW 1795 (Page 63, 8vo. edition—a note.)—“ With respect to the two houses of which the English parliament is composed, they appear to be effectually influenced into one; and, as a legislature, to have no temper of its own. The minister, whoever he at any time may be, touches it as with an opium wand, and it sleeps obedience. hs 
GARROW 1796 “ But if we look at the distinct abilities of the two houses, the difference will appear so great, as to shew the inconsistency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to use it. Wretched as the state of Tepresentation is in England, it is manhood compared with what is called the House of Lords ; and so little is this nick-named house regarded, that the people scarcely inquire, at any time, what it is doing. It appears also to be most under influence, and the furthest removed from the general interest of the nation. In the debate on engaging in the Russian and Turkish war, the majority in the House of Peers, in favour of it, was upwards of ninety; when in the other house, which is more than double its numbers, .the majority was sixty-three. 
GARROW 1797 (Page 65, 8vo. edition.) —“ But in whatever manner the separate parts of a constitution may be arranged, there is one general principle that distinguishes freedom from slavery, which is, that all hereditary government over a people is to them a species of fslavery, and representative government is freedom,’, 
GARROW 1798 (Page 107, 8vo. edition.)— Having thus glanced at some of the defects of the two houses of parliament, I proceed to what is called the crown, upon which I shall be very concise, 
GARROW 1799 “ It signifies a nominal office of a million sterling a year, the business of which consists in receiving the money
LAUZUN 1800 Whether the person be wise or foolish, sane or insane, a native or a foreigner, matters not. Every ministry acts upon the same idea that Mr. Burke writes ; namely, that the people must be hood-winked, and held in superstitious ignorance by some bugbear or other; and what is called the crown answers this purpose, and therefore it answers all the purposes to be expected from it. This is more than can be said of the other two branches.

ERSKINE 1825 (if such writings shall be thought to deserve any other refutation than that of criminal jusbi rine) by others who may think with Mr. Burke, and with the same zeal.’ 
ERSKINE 1826 “ In the first place, it has not yet been done by any body. Not less, I believe, than eight or ten pamphlets intended as answers to the former part of the ‘ Rights of Man’ have been published by different persons, and not one of them, to my knowledge, has extended to a second edition, nor are even the titles of them so much as generally remembered. As I am averse to unnecessarily multiplying publications, I have answered none of them. And as I believe that a man may write himself out of reputation when nobody else can do it, I am careful to avoid that rock. 
ERSKINE 1827 But as I would decline urnecessary publieations on the one hand, so would I avoid every thing that might appear like sullen pride on the other. If Mr. Burke, or any person on his side the question, will produce an answer to the Rights of Man,’ that shall extend to an half, or even to a fourth part of the number of copies to which the Rights of Man extended, I will reply to his work. But until this be done, I shall so far take the sense of the public for my guide (and the world knows I am not a flatterer) that what they do not think worth while to read, is not worth mine to answer. I suppose the number of copies to which the first part of the Rights of Man extended, taking England, Scotland, and [reland, is not tess than between forty and fifty thousand. 
ERSKINE 1828  now come to remark on the remaining part of the quotation I have made from Mr. Burke. 
ERSKINE 1829 “ f) says he, ‘such writings shall be thought to deserve any other refutation than that of criminal justice. 
ERSKINE 1830 “ Pardoning the pun, it must be criminal justice indeed that should condemn a work as a substitute for not being able to refute it. The greatest condemnation that could be passed upon it would be a refutation. But in proceeding by the method Mr. Burke alludes to, the condemnation would, in the final event, pass upon the criminality of the process and not tspon the work, and in this case, I had rather be the author, than be either the judge, or the jury, that should condemn it. But to come at once to the point. Thave differed from some professional gentlemen on the subject of prosecutions, and I since find they are falling into my opinion, which I will here state as fully, but as concisely as I can. 
ERSKINE 1831 “will first put a case with respect to any law, and then compare it with a government, or with what in England is, or has been called a constitution. “ It would be an act of despotism, or what in England is called arbitrary power, to make a law to prohibit investigating the principles, good or bad, on which such a law, or any other is founded. 
ERSKINE 1832 “ Ifa lew be bad, it is one thing to oppose the practice of it, but it is quite a different thing to expose its errors, to reason on its defects, and to show cause why it should be repealed, or why another ought to be substi tuted in its place. I have always held it an opinion (making it also my practice) that it is better to obey a bad law, making use at the same time of every argument to show its errors and procure its repeal, than forcibly to violate it; Mecaine the precedent of bree a bad law might weaken the force, and } 
ERSKINE 1833 to a discretionary violation, of those which ate good. 
ERSKINE 1834 “ THe case is the same with respect to principles and forms of government, or to what are called constitutions and the parts of which they are composed. 
ERSKINE 1835 “ It is for the good of nations, and not for the emolument or aggrandizement of particular individuals, that government ought to be established, and that mankind are at the expence of supporting it. The defects of every government and constitution, both as to principle and form must, on a parity of reasoning, be as open to discussion as the defects of a law, and itis a duty which every man owes to society to point them out. When those defects, and the means of remedying them are generally seen by a nation, that nation will reform its government or its constitution in the one case, as the government repealed or reformed the law in the other, The operation of government is restricted to the making and the administering of laws; but it is to a nation that the right of forming or reforming, generating or regenerating con stitutions and governments belong ; and consequently those subjects, as subjects of investigation, are always before a country as a matter of right. aud cannot, without invading the general rights of that country, be made subjects for prosecution. On this ground I will meet Mr. Burke whenever he please. It is better that the whule argument should come out, than to seek to stifle it. It was himself that opened the controversy, and he ought not to desert it. , 
ERSKINE 1836 “ I do not believe that monarchy and aristocracy will continue seven years longer in any of the enlightened countries in Europe. If better reasons can be shown for them than against them, they will stand; if the contrary, they will not. Mankind are not now to he told they shall not think, or they shalk not read ; and publications that go no farther than to investigate principles of government, to invite men to reason and to reflect, and to shew the errors and excellencies of different systems, have aright to appear. If they do not excite attention, they are not worth the trouble of a prosecution; aud if they do, the prosecution will amount to nothing, since it cannot amount to a prohibition of reading. This would be a sentence on the public, mstead of the author, and would also be the ninst effectual mode of making or hastening revolutions. 
ERSKINE 1837 “ On all cases that apply universally to a nation, With respect to systems of government, a jury of twelve men is not competent to decide. Where there are no witnesses to be examined, no facts to be proved, and where the whole matter is before the whole public, and the merits or demerits of it resting on their opinion; and where there is nothing to be known ina court, but what every body knows out of it, every twelve men is equally as good a jury as the other, and would most probably reverse each other’s verdict; or from the variety of their opinions, not be able to form one. It is one case, whether the nation approve a work, or aplan; but is quite another case, whether it will commit to any such jury the ower of determining whether that nation ave a right to, or shall reform its government or not. I mention those cases, that Mr. Burke may see I have not written on government without reflecting on what is law, as well as on what are rights
LAUZUN 1838 The only effectual jury in such cases would be, a convention of the whole nation fairly elected ; for in all such cases the whole nation is the vicinage. If Mr. Burke will propose such a jury, I will wave all privileges of being the citizen of another country, and, defending its principles, abide the issue, provided he will do the same ; for my opinion 1s, that his work and his principles would be condemned instead of mine. 
ERSKINE 1839 “As to the prejudices which men have from education and habit, in favour of any particular form or system of government, those paspiices have yet to stand the test of reason and reflection. In fact, such prejudices are nothing. No man is prejudiced in favour of a thing, knowing it to be wrong. He is attached to it on the belief of te tela right ; and when he sees it is not so, the prejudice will be gone. We have but a defective idea of what prejudice is. It might be said, that until nien think for themselves the whole is prejudice, and not opinion; for that ouly is Opinion which is the result of reason and reflection. I offer this remark, that Mr. Burke may not confide too much in what has been the customary prejudices of the country. 
ERSKINE 1840 “ TI do not believe that the people of England have ever been fairly and candidly dealt by. They have been imposed upon by parties, and by men assuming the character of leaders. It is time that the nation should rise above those trifles. It is time to dismiss that inattention which has so long been the encouraging cause of stretching taxation to excess. Itis time to dismiss all those songs and toasts which are calculated to enslave, and operate to suffocate reflection. On all such subjects men have but to think, and they will neither act wrong nor be misled. Tosay that any people are not fit for freedom, is to make poverty their choice, and to say they had rather be loaded with taxes than not. If such a case could be proved, it would equally prove, that those who govern are not fit to govern them, for they area part of the same national mass, 
ERSKINE 1841 “ But admitting governments to be changed all over Europe; it certainly may be done without convulsion or revenge. It is not worth making changes or revolutions, unless it be for some great national benefit; and when this shall appear toa nation, the danger will be, as in America and France, to those who oppose ; and with this reflection I close my preface. 
ERSKINE 1842 homas Paine. London, Feb. 9, 1792. 
GARROW 1843 I had dismissed this book, but the reading of the preface has reminded me of some passages I had overlooked. 
GARROW 1844 (Page 161, 8vo. edition.)—“ The fraud bypocrisy, and imposition of governments are now beginning to be too well understood to promise them any long career. The farce of monarchy and aristocracy, in all countries is following that of chivalry, and Mr. Burke is dressing for the funeral. Let it then quietly to the tomb of all other follies and the mourners be comforted. 
GARROW 1845 he time is not very distant when England will laugh at itself for sending to Holland Hanover, Zell, or Brunswick for men, at the expense ofa million a year, who understood neither her laws, her language, nor her interest, and whose capacities would scarcely have fitted them for the office of a parish constable. If government could be trusted to such hands, it must be some easy and simple thing indeed, and materials fit for all the purposes may be found in every town and Sillege in England. 
GARROW 1846 (Page 161, 8vo. edition.)—“ Within the space of a few years we have seen two revolutions, those of Americg and France. In the former, the contest was long, and the conflict severe; in the latter, the nation acted with sucha consolidated impulse, that having no foreign enemy to contend with, the revolution was complete in power the moment it appeared. From both those instances it is evident, that the greatest forces that can be brought into the feld of revolutions, are reason and common interest. Where these can have the opportunity of acting, opposition dies with fear, or crumbles away by conviction. It is a great standing which they have now universally obtained ; and we may hereafter hope to see revolutions, or changes in governments produced with the same quiet operation by which any measure, determinable by reason and discussion, is accomplished. 
GARROW 1847 “When anation changes its opinion and habits of thinking, it is no longer to be a verned as before; but it would not only wrong, but bad policy, to attempt by force what ought to be accomplished by reason. Rebellion consists in forcibl opposing the general will of a nation whether by a party orbyagovernment. There ought, therefore, to be in every nation a method of occasionally ascertaining the state of public opinion with t to government. On this point the old government of France was superior to the present government of England, because, on exinary occasions, recourse could be had to what was then called the States-general. Bat in England “there are no such occasional bodies; and as to those who are now called representatives, a great part of them are mere machines of the court, placemen, and depen
GARROW 1848 (Page 170, 8vo. edition—a note.)—“ I know it is the opinion of many of the most enlightened characters in France, (there always will be those who see farther into events than others) not only among the’ general mass of citizens but of many of the principal members of the former National Assembly, that the monarchical plan will not continue many years in that country. They have found out, that as wisdom cannot be made hereditary, powet ought not; and that, for a man to merit a million sterling a year from a nation, he ought to have a mind capable of comprehending from an atom to a universe; which, ifhehad, he would be above receiving the pay. But they wished not to appear to lead the nation faster than its own reason and interest dictated. In all the conversations where Ihave been present upon this subject, the idea always was, that when such a time, from the general opinion of the nation, shall arrive, that the honourable and liberal method would be, to make a handsome present, in fee simple, to the person, whocver he may be, that shall then be in the monarchical office, and forhim to retire to the enjoyment of private lite, possessing his share of general rights and privileges, and to be no more accountable to the public for his time and his conduct than any other citizen. 
GARROW 1849 I shall now return to the Proceedings of the Constitutional Society ; read an entry at a meeting of the 5th of October, 1792. 
GARROW 1850 “ Ata meeting of the society held at the Crown and A nchor-tavern, Strand, on Friday, October 5th, 1792.

GARROW 1853 “Ordered, That the letter from the London Corresponding Society, entered on the minutes ofthe last meeting, together with the resolution of the society thereon, be published in the pers. wa Reed the following letter from Mr. Joel Barlow, to the Society for Constitutional Information, London ; 
GARROW 1854 “Gentlemen, I have just published a small treatise, in a letter to the National Convention of France, on the defects of the constitution of 1791, and the extent of the amendments which ought to be applied. As the true pouerce oF government are the same in all countries, being founded on the Rights of Man, which are universal and imprescriptible, I conceive the subject of this treatise cannot be foreign to the great object of your association, of which you have done me the favour to make me an honorary member; I, therefore, present a copy of it to you, with the same confidence that Ihave done te the National Convention, a confidence arising froma full conviction that the work is founded in truth and reason, although these principles seem not so immediately reducible to practice in the government of this country asin that of France, yet their examination can never be unseasonable. 
GARROW 1855 “ A great revolution in the management of the affairs of nations, is, doubtless, soon to be expected through all Europe; and, in the progress of mankind towards this attainment, it Is greatly to bedesired that the convictions to be squires from rational discussion, should precede and preclude those which must result from physical exertion.

GARROW 1864 “ Resolved, That Mr. Sturch be requested to draw up an answer to the letter of Mr. Barlow read at the last meeting, expressing how much pride this society feel at having elected him an honorary member. 
GARROW 1865 I believe you are a bookseller in St. Paul's Church Yard 
LAUZUN 1866 I am. 
GARROW 1867 And a publisher
LAUZUN 1868 I am. 
GARROW 1869 Be so good as look at that pamphlet which you have in your hand, and tell me whether that is of your publishing
LAUZUN 1870 I really cannot answer that question. 
GARROW 1871 Do you know the person who appears to be the author, Joel Barlow 
LAUZUN 1872 Yes, I do. 
GARROW 1873 It appears to be published by you, does it not
LAUZUN 1874 It does, I published such a pamphlet. 
GARROW 1875 I am not asking you at present whether these sheets of paper came out of your shop, have the goodness to attend to the question, you know Mr. Barlow you say 
LAUZUN 1876 Yes, I do. 
GARROW 1877 Did you publish for him at any time a work with the title of that pamphlet
LAUZUN 1878 I did. 
GARROW 1879 Had you communication with him upon the subject of that publication 
LAUZUN 1880 I had. 
GARROW 1881 Did you from him receive the manuscript
LAUZUN 1882 I think I did. 
GARROW 1883 Have you any doubt of it
LAUZUN 1884 Whether he gave it to me or the printer I am not sure. 
GARROW 1885 Who paid you for it
LAUZUN 1886 The sale paid for it. 
GARROW 1887 Be so good as look at it, and tell me whether you have any doubt that it was published by you for Joel Barlow 
LAUZUN 1888 I cannot recollect the contents of pamphlets I publish. suppose not, you publish a good many ?—I believe it to be that. 
GARROW 1889 Have you any doubt about it
LAUZUN 1890 I cannot say I have any doubt about it. 
GARROW 1891 You publish a great many books, and you do not always recollect the contents, did it happen to you to publish the Rights of Man
LAUZUN 1892  No. 
GARROW 1893 Did you sell any 
LAUZUN 1894 Yes. 
GARROW 1895 How many copies, I do not ask you to within a thousand, but about how many do you think you sold
LAUZUN 1896 I cannot tell. 
GARROW 1897 Did you sell many or few 
LAUZUN 1898 I cannot tell what you mean by many. 
GARROW 1899 Did you sell some dozens 
LAUZUN 1900 Certainly I did —when that pamphlet was published it was supposed not to be a lihel, afterwards it was proved to be one. I beg to ask the Court whether I am obliged to answer that question? 
EYRE 1901 It will not exse you to any hazard to say whether you appen to know how many copies were published. The witness ought not to, be asked how many he published himself. 
GARROW 1902 Do you know of your own knowledge whether the sale of the book called the Rights of Man was extensive or not? I do not ask you whether you sold one yourself. —Yes, I think I can say that the sale was large. Do you recollect receiving any number of a publication called a Letter to Mr. Dundas from Mr. Paine
LAUZUN 1903 I did not publish it. T did not ask if you published it, or whether you distributed any of it, but whether any certain rumer of copies of that publication were sent to you by any body—I will assist your memory, were there not seven hundred sent to you?—I think there were some sent to me and forwarded into the country—a parcel was sent to me to convey to the coach, I believe. 
GARROW 1904 Where from
LAUZUN 1905 I do not know, but I suppose, from the printer’s. 
GARROW 1906 Do not you know of your own knowledge by whose order they were sent, or from whom they came
LAUZUN 1907 No. 
GARROW 1908 You said the sale of Mr. Barlow’s Letter aid for the expense—what quantity might e sold
LAUZUN 1909 Perhaps five or six hundred— 
GARROW 1910 really do not know. 
GARROW 1911 [Extracts read from—“ A Letter to the National Convention of France, on the Defects of the Constitution of 1791, and the extent of the amendments which ought to be applied, by Joel Barlow, esq. author of Advice to Privileged Orders."} 
GARROW 1912 (From page 1, to the middle of page 12.)— “ gentlemen the time is at last arrived when the people of France, by resorting to their own proper dignity, feel themselves at liberty to exercise their unembarrassed reason, in establishing an equal government. The present crisis in your affairs, marked by the assembling of a National Convention, bears nearly the same relation to the last four years of your history, as your whole revolution bears to the great accumulated mass of modern improvement; compared, therefore, with all that is past, it is perhaps the most interesting portion of the most important period that Europe has hitherto seen. 
GARROW 1913 “Under this impression, and with the deepest sense of the magnitude of the subject which engages your attention, I take a liberty which no “i ht motives could warrant ina stranger, the liberty of offering a few observations on the business that lies before you. Could I suppose, however, that any apology were necessary for this intrusion, I should not rely upon the one here mentioned, but my intentions require no apology; I demand to be heard, as aright. Your cause is that of human nature at large ; you are the representatives of mankind; and though I am not literally one of your constituents, yet I must be bound by your decrees. My pines will be seriously affected by your deliberations; and in them I have an interest, which. nothing can destroy. I not only consider all mankind as forming but one great family, and therefore hound by a natural sympathy to regard each other's peptone as making part of their own; but I contemplate the French nation at this moment as standing in the place of the whole, you have stepped forward with a gigantic stride to an enterprise which involves the interests of every surrounding nation; and what you began as justice to yourselves, you are called upon ta finish as a duty to the human race. 
GARROW 1914  believe no man cherishes s greater veneration than I have uniformly done, for. 
GARROW 1915 the Nationaf Assembly who framed that constitution, which I now presume your constituents expect you to revise. Perhaps the merits of that body of men will never be properly apprectated. The greatest part of their exertions were necessarily spent on objects which cannot be deScribed; and which from their nature can meake no figure in history. The enormous weight of abuses they had to overturn, the quantity of pee with which their fune tions called them to contend, as well in their own minds as in those of all the European world, the open opposition of interests, the secret weapons of corruption, and the unbridied fury of despairing faction—these are subjects bik escape our common observation, when we contemplate the labours of that assembly. But the legacy they have left to their country in their deliberative capacity will remain a lasting monument to their praise; and though while searching out the defective parts of their work, without losing sight of the difficulties under which it was formed, we may find more occasion to admire its wisdom, than to murmur at its faults; yet this consideration ought not to deter us from the attempt. 
GARROW 1916 he great leading principle, on which their constitution was meant to be founded, is the equality of rights. This principle bein; laid down withsuch clearness, and asserted wit so much dignity in the beginning of the code, it is strange that men of clear understandings should fail to be charmed with the beauty of the system which nature must have taught them to build on that foundation. It shows a disposition to counteract the analogy of nature, to see them at one moment impressing this indelible principle on our minds and with the next breath declaring, that France shall remain a monarchy, that it shall have a king, hereditary, inviolable, clothed with all the executive, and much of the legislative ywer, commander in chief of all the national ree by land and sea, having the initiative of war, and the power of concluding peace, and above all, to hear them declare that, The nation will provide for the splendour of the throne,’ granting in their legislative capacity to that throne more than a million sterling a year, from the national purse, besides the rents of estates which are said to amount to half as much more. 
GARROW 1917 “ We must be astonished at the paradoxical Organization of the minds of men who could see no discordance in these ideas, they begin with the open simplicity of a rational republic, and immediately plunge into all the labyrinths of royalty; and 4 great part of the constitutional code is a practical attempt to reconcile these two discordant theories It is a perpetual conflict between principle and precedent, between the manly truths of nature, which we all must feel, and the learned subtilties of Statesmen, about which we have been taught fo reason. 
GARROW 1918 “ In reviewing the history of lumen opimions, it is an unpleasant consideration to remark how slow the mind has alwavs beem in seizing the most’ interesting truths; although, when discovered, they appear to have been the most obvious. where verified with more circumstances of regret, than in the progress of vour ideas im 
GARROW 1919 France relative to the inutility of the kinglyoffice. It was not enough that you too your first stand upon the high ground of natural right; where, enlightened hy the sus of reason, you might have seen the clouds of prejudice roll far beneath your feet, it was not enough: that you began by considering royalty, with its well known scourges as being the cause of all your evils, that the kings of modern Europe are the authors of war and misery, that their mutual intercourse is s commerce of human slaughter—that public debts and private oppressions, with ‘all the degrading vices that tarnish the face of nature, had their origin in that species of government which offers a premium for wickedness, and teaches the few to trample on the many; it was not enough that you saw the means ofa regeneration of mankind in the system of equal rights, and that in a wealthy and powerful nation you possessed the advantage of reducing that system to immediate practice asan example to the world, and a consolation to human nature. All these arguments, with a variety of others, which your republican orators placed in the strongest point oflight, were insufficient to raise the public mind to a proper view of the subject. 
GARROW 1920 “It seems that some of your own philosophers had previously taught, that royalty was Necessary to a great nation. Montesquieu, among his whimsieal maxims about laws and government, had informed the world thata i limited monarchy was the best possible system, 'and that a democracy could never flourish ; but in a small tract of country. How many of your legislators believed in this doctrine ; how many acted from temporising motives, wishing to banish royalty by slow degrees; and how many were led by principles less pardonable than either, it is impossible to determine. Certain it is, that republican ideas gained no ground upon the monarchical in your constituting assembly, during the last 8ix months of their deliberations. It is like-wise certain, that the majority of thatassembly took much pains to prevent the people from discovering the cheat of royalty, and to continue their ancient veneration, at least for awhile, in favour of certain principles in gos vernment, which reason could not approve, 
GARROW 1921 “It is remarkable, that all the perfidy of our king, at the time of his flight, should ave had so little effect in opening the eyes of so enlightened a people as the French, His flight, and the insulting declaration which he left behind him, were sufficient not onl: to give the lie to the fiction, with whic! common sense has always been put to the 
GARROW 1922 This renark isnoblush, and t6 which your assembly had ettempted to give a sanction, That Kingscan do no wrong; but they were sufficient to show, at least to all who would open their eyes, that the business of government required no such officer. There is no period, during your revolution, if there is any to be found in the history of France, when business went on with morg alacrity and good order, than during the suspension of the reyal functions, in the interval, from the time that the king was brought back to the capital, m June, tll the Completion of the constitution in September. Every: thing went right in the kingdom, except within the walls of the assembly. A majority of that body was determined to make an riment. of a limited monarchy. The e ment has been made. Its duration has, indeed, been short, being less than eleven months; but, although in some respects it has been almostas fatal to the cause of liberty as any system could have been within the time, yet in other respects, it has done more good t sophers of the age could have done in a much longer time: it has taught them a new doctrine, which no experience can shake, and which reason must confirm, That Kings can do no good. 
GARROW 1923 (oops 14 and part of 15)
LAUZUN 1924 “ Among the probable evils resulting from the kingly office, the principal one, and indeed the only one that need to be mentioned, is the chance of its being held by a weak or a wicked man. When the office is hereditary, it is scarcely to be expected but thas this should always be the case. Considering the birth and education of princes, the chance of finding one with practical common sense, is hardly to be reckoned among possible events; nor is the probability Jess strong against their having virtue. The temptations to wickedness arising from their situation, are too povertul to beresisted. The persuasive arts of all their flatterers, the companions of their youth, the ministers of their pleasures, and every person with whom they ever converse, are necessarily employed to induce them to increase their revenue, by oppressing the people, whom they are taught from their cradle, to consider as beasts of burthen ; and what must almost insure the triumph of wickedness in their tempers, is, the idea that they act totally and tor ever without restraint. This is an allurement to vice, that even men of sense could scarcely resist. Impress it on the mind of any man, that he can do no wrong, and he will soon convince you of your misake this general summary of the evils arising from hereditary monarchy, under any restrictions that can be proposed, and place it on one side of the account, and state, on the other side, the. truth which I believe no man of reflection will hereafter call in question, That Kings can do no good, and the friends of Hiberty will no longer be in doubt which way you will decide the question -elative to that part of your constitution anall the reasonings of all the philo
GARROW 1925 (Page 22 to 26)
LAUZUN 1926 “ But it-wil be said, F am too late, with all these observations, on the necessity of proscribing royalty from your constitution. The cause is already judged in the minds of the whole people of France; and their wishes will surely be the rule of your conduct. I suppose that, without being retmainded of your duty by a stranger, one of your first resolutions would be, to fix a national anathema on every vestige of regal power, and endeavour to wipe out from the human character the stain which it received with its veneration for kings and hereditary claims. But it requires much reflection, to be well aware to what extent this duty should carry you. There are many vices in your constitution, which though not apparently connected with the king, had their eae in regal ideas. To purify the whole code from these vices, and to purge human nature from their effects, it will be necessary to resort to many principles which appear not to have struck the minds of the first assembly. 
GARROW 1927 “ You will permit me to hint at some of the great outlines of what may be expected from you under the peculiar advantages with which, you meet to form a glorious republic. Ab though many of my ideas may be perfectly superfluous, Sane the same as will occur to every member of your body, yet it is possible that some of them may strike the mind in a new point of Jight, and lead to reflections which would not rise from any other quarter. Should this be the casein the sinallest degree, it ought to be considered, both by you and me, as an ample reward for our pains in writing and in reading this letter. 
GARROW 1928 “ On considering the subjectof government, when the mind is once set loose from the shackles of royalty, it finds itself in a new world: it rises toa more extensive view of every circumstance of the social state. Human nature assumes a new and more elevated shape, and displays many moral features, which, from having been always disguised, were not known to exist. In this case, it is a long time before we acquire a habit of traeing effects to their proper causes, and of applying the easy and simple remedy to those vices of our nature which society requires us to restrain. This, I apprehend, is the source of by far the greatest difficulties with which you have to contend. We are so much used, in government, to the most complicated systems, as being necessary to support those imPositions, erat oUt which it has been supposed impossible for men to be governed, that it is an unusual task to conceive of the simplicity to which the business of government may be reduced, and to which it must be reduced, if we would have it answer the purpose of promoting happiness. 
GARROW 1929 “ After presnling royalty, with all its appendages, I suppose it will not be thought necessary in France to support any other errors and superstitions of a similar complexion ; but that undisguised reason, in all things, will be preferred to the cloak of imposition. Should this be the case, you will conceive it no loner necessary to maintain a national church. 
GARROW 1930 "his establishment is so manifestly an imposition upon the judgment of mankind, that the sopiiuting assembly must have considered it in that light. It is one of those monarchical ideas, which pay -us the wretched compliment of supposing, that we are not capable of being perenne by our own reason. To suppose that the people of France are to learn the mode of worshipping ‘God from the decrees of the council of Trent, is certainly as absurd as it would ‘be to appeal to such a council, to learn how to breathe, or to open their eyes. Neither is it true, as is argued by the advocates of this part of your constitution, that the preference there given to one mode of worship, by the payment of the Catholic priests from the national purse, to the exclusion of others, was ‘founded on the idea of the property supposed to ‘have been possessed by that church, and which, by the assembly, was declared to be thenceforward the property of the nation. 
GARROW 1931 he church, in this sense of the word, signifies nothing but a mode of worship ; and to prove that a mode can he a proprietor of lands, requires a subtility of logic that I shall not attempt torefute. The fact is, the church, considered as an hierarchy, was always necessary to the support of royalty; and your assembly, with great consistency of design, wishing to preserve something of the old-fabric, preserved something of this necessar prop. But as the fabric is now overturned, the prop may be safely taken away. I am confident that monarchy and hierarchy will be buried in the same grave, and that in Trance they will not survive the present year. 
GARROW 1932 (Page-I,)—“ After laying down the great fundamental principle, thatak men are equal tn their rights, it ought to be the invariable object of the social compact to insure the exercise of that equality, by rendering them as ena in all sorts of enjoyments, as can possibly be consistent with good order, industry, and the reward of merit. Every individual ought to he rendered as independent of every other individual as possible; and, atthe same time, as dependent as possible on the whole community. 
GARROW 1933 “ On this siwieniable maxim, I think-the following positions ought to be founded and guaranteed in the constitutional code. 
LAUZUN 1934 I found this letter in Mr. Hardy’s house among his other papers. 
LAUZUN 1935 “ Gentlemen, I have lately published a small treatise under the title of ‘A Letter to 6 the National Convention of France,’on the Defects in the constitution of 1791, and the extent of the Amendments which ought to beapplied.’ Although the observations contained in this letter are more particular plicable:to the French nation in the nie crisis of its government, yet, as the true principles of society are every where the same, their examination cannot be unseasonable ia any nation-or atany time. Believing, therefore, that-the subject of this treatise will not be thought foreign to the great object of your association, I present a copy of it to you, with the same confidence as f have done to the 
LAUZUN 1936 National Convention, .and to the Constitutional Society in London: a confidence arising from the full persuasion that the work ‘is founded in truth and reason. d takethe liberty at the same time to send you a copy of another publication, : intituled, 
LAUZUN 1937 “ Advice to the Privileged Ordere.’ The present disposition in Kurope towards a general revolution in the prineiple of government, is founded in a current of opinion too secon to be resisted, as well as too sacred to e treated with neglect. It is the duty of every individual to assist, not only in removing the obstructions that are found in the way of this revolution, but in ascertaining with as much precision as possible the nature of the object to be aimed at, and the consequences to be expected from the attainment. It is above all things to he desired that-the convictions to be acquired from rational discussion, should precede and preclude those which must result from physical exertion. ‘ 
LAUZUN 1938 “ Such, 1 believe, is the object of your society, and such is certainly that of your friend and servant, Jost Bartow. 
LAUZUN 1939 “ London, Oct. 6th, 1792. 
LAUZUN 1940 Addressed o the London Corresponding Society, care of Mr. ThomasHardy, No.9 Piccadilly.’ 
GARROW 1941 Who was the author of this pamphlet, which appears to have been published by you, intituled “ Advice to the Privileged Orders ?"—I published a amphlet with that title tor Mr. Barlow: I believe this is it. 
GARROW 1942 Do you know whether he was the sole author of it, or were there any other persons: concerned in it
LAUZUN 1943 I cannot tell; but I really believe he was the sole author. 
GARROW 1944 Which you published in the same way, I suppose, as you did the other—Had it a large sale 
LAUZUN 1945 Not a very arge sale ; not many more than a thousand, I believe. 
GARROW 1946 Extracts read from “ Advice to the Privileged Orders of the several States of Europe, resulting from the Necessity and Propriety of aGeneral Revolution in the Principles of Government, Part I. the Third Edition, by Joel Barlow.} 
GARROW 1947 (From page 17 to page 20)
LAUZUN 1948 “ Mr. Burke, however, in his detence of royalty, does not rely on this argument of the compact. Whether it be that he is conscious of its futility, or that in his rage he forgets that he has use it, he is perpetually securing to the lass ground that has yet been heard of on which we are called upon to consider kings, even as & tolerable nuisance, and to support the existjog forms of government; this ground is the encral goud of the community. It is said to dangerous to pull down systems that are already turmed, or even to attempt to improve them; and it is likewise said, that, were they peaceably destroyed, and we had society to build-up anew, it would be best to create hereditary kings, hereditary orders, and exclusive privileges. 
GARROW 1949 “ These are sober opinions, uniting a class of reasoners too numerous and too respectable to be treated with contempt. I believe, however, that their number is every day diminishing ; and I believe the example which France will soon be obliged to exhibit to the world on this subject, will induce every man to reject them who is not personally and exclusively interested in their support. 
GARROW 1950 “ The inconsistency of the Constituent Assembly, in retaining an hereditary king, armed with an enormous civil list, to wage war with aa popular government, has induced some persons to predict the downfall of their constitution ; but this measure had a different origin from what is commonly assigned to it, and: 
GARROW 1951 will probably have a different issue; it was the result rather of local and temporary circumstances, than of any general belief in the utility of kings, under any modifications or limitations that could be attached to the office. 
GARROW 1952 “ It is to be observed, first, that the French had a king upon their hands: this king had always been considered as a well-disposed man; so that, by a fatality somewhat singular, though not unexampled in regal history, he gained the love of the people almost in proportion to the mischief which he did them. 
GARROW 1953 condly, their king had very powerful family connexions in the sovereigns of Spain, Austria, Naples, and Sardinia, besides his relations within the kingdom, whom it was necessary to attach, if possible, to the interests of the community. Thirdly, the Revolution was considered by all Europe as a high and dangerous experiment; it was necessary to hide, as much as possible, the appearance of its Magnitude frum the eye of the distant observer, The reformers considered it as their duty to produce an internal regeneration of society, ratier than an external change in the appearance of the court; to set in order the counting-house and the kitchen, before arranging the drawing-room. This would leave the savereigns of Europe totally without a pretext for interfering, while it would be consoling to that class of philosophers who still believed in the compatibility of royalty and liberty. Fourthly, this decree that France should huve a king, and that he could do no wrong, was passed at an early period of their operations, when the above reasons were apparently more urgent than they were afterwards, or probably will ever be again. 
GARROW 1954 “From these considerations we may can clude that royalty ts preserved in France for reasons which are fugitive; that a majority of the Constituent Assembly did not believe in it as an abstract principle; that a majority of the people will learn to be disgusted with so unnatural and ponderous a deformity in their new edifice, and will soon hew it off. 
GARROW 1955 “ After this improvement shall bave been made, a few years experience in the face of Europe, and on so great a theatre as that of France, will probably leave but one opinion, in the minds of honest men, relative to the republican principle, or the great simplicity of nature, applied to the organization of society. 
GARROW 1956 (Page 21 )—“ It depends on a much more important class of meu, the class that cannot write, and in a great measure on those who cannot read ; it is to be decided by men who reason better without books, than we do with all the books in the world: taking it for granted, therefore, that a general revolution is at hand, whose progress is irresistible, my object is to contemplate its probable effects, and to comfort those who are afflicted at the prospect. 
GARROW 1957 Did you publish the former editions of this work 
JOHNSON 1958 I did. Perhaps you mean that the sale of each edition was not more than you mentioned ?—There were three editions, five hundred each een, and there were a considerable number eft. 
GARROW 1959 Was this first published before the death of the late king of the French, or not? 
JOHNSON 1960 What is the date in the title page? 
GARROW 1961 This is the third edition—Do you know whether this was published before, or after that event
JOHNSON 1962 I cannot tell; I think it was published in 1792, or 1791. 
GARROW 1963 Be so good as look at that pamphlet: it is called “A Letter to the Addressers, by Thomas Paine. Do you know whether any pamphlet of that sort was published by Thomas Paine 
JOHNSON 1964 Certainly there was.

JOHNSON 1968 No. 
GARROW 1969 Have you seen any of the cheap edition 
JOHNSON 1970 Yes. 
GARROW 1971 Do you know whether that was published about the same tine 
JOHNSON 1972 It was published after the large edition; I do not know how long. 
GARROW 1973 Look at that copy of the cheap edition, and say whether you believe that to be one of the copies that were published
JOHNSON 1974 I cangot say, because any printer may copy this. 
ERSKINE 1975 Do you mean to swear that the large edition is; that either is
JOHNSON 1976 No. I only believe it from the appearance of it; any printer may copy it. 
GARROW 1977 You have already said, that you believe that to be one of the copies of the large edition which was published by Mr. Paine 
JOHNSON 1978 It has all the appearance of it; any printer may take a fac simile copy of it. Upon looking at it, do you believe it to be one, or have you any doubt on the subject ?—I cannot positively say; a printer may print a fac simile of it. 
GARROW 1979 Do you believe that to have been printed by a printer making a fac simile without authority, or to be one of the original edition? I ask you upon your oath
JOHNSON 1980 I cannot say, because a printer can make a fac simile. 
EYRE 1981 Unless he can speak from the type, or the intrinsic circumstances, it is nothing

GARROW 1989 I am not asking the witness whether he published or gold any of them, or whether he lent any one, but whether he had any communication with the author upon the subject
JOHNSON 1990 The author printed it, to the best of my knowledge, when I was in the country ; I was at Margate, I believe, at the time when he printed this pamphlet.

GARROW 2000 “ Frenchmen !|—While foreign robbers are ravaging your territories, under the specious retext of justice; cruelty and desolation leading on their van, perfidy with treache' bringing up their rear, yet mercy and friendship impudentiy held forth to the world as the sole motives of their incursions, the oppressed part of mankind forgetting, for awhile, their own sufferings, feel only for yours, and with an anxious eye watch the event, fere vently supplicating the Almighty Ruler of the Universe to be favourable to your cause, so intimately blended with their own. ’ “ Frowned upon by an oppressive system of control, whose gradual, but continued en croachments, have deprived this nation of nearly all its boasted liberty, and brought us almost to that abject state of slavery, frone which you have so emerged, 5,000 British citizens, indignant, manfully step forth to rescue their country from the opprobrium brought upon it, by the supine conduct of those in power. They conceive it to be the duty of Britons to countenance and assist, to the utmost of their power, the champions of human happiness, and to swear to a nation, proceeding on the plan you have adopted, aa inviolable friendship. ed from this day be that friendship between us ! And may vergeance to the uttermost, evertake the man who hereafter shall attempt to cause a rupture. “ Though we appear so few at present, be assured, Frenchmen, that our mumber increases daily ; it is true, that the stern uplifted arm of authority at present keeps back the timid, that busily circulated impostors hourly mislead the credulous, and that court intimacy, with avowed French traitors, has some effect on the unwary, and op the any bitions. But, with certainty, we can inform you, friends and freemen, that information makes a rapid progress among us. Curiosity has taken possession of the public mind; the conjoint reign of ignorance and despotism asses away. Men now ask each other, what is freedom? what are our rights? Frenchmen, you are already free, and Britons are preparing to become so ! “ Casting far from us the criminal prejudices artfully inaulcated by evil-minded men, and wily courtiers; we, mstead of natural enemies, at length discover in Frenchmen, our fellow citizens of the world, and our brethren by the same Heavenly Father, who created us for the purpose of loving and mutually assisting each other; but not to hate, and to be ever ready to cut each others throats, at the command of weak or ambitious kings, and corrupt ministers. 
GARROW 2001 “Seeking our real enemies, we find them in our bosoms; we feel ourselves inwardly torn by, and ever the victims of a restless, all-consuming aristocracy, hitherto the bane of every nation under the sun! Wisely have you acted in expelling it from France. 
GARROW 2002 “ Warm as are our wishes for your success, eager as we are to behold freedom triumphant, and man every where restored to the enjoyment of his just rights,.a sense of our duty, as orderly citizens, forbids our flying in arms to your assistance; our government has pledged the national faith to remain neutral: in a struggle of liberty against despotism, Britons remain neutral! O shame! But we have entrusted our king with discretionary powers; —we therefore must obey; our hands are bound, but our hearts are free, and they are awith you.

GARROW 2012 “ It is with reason that you think the subject of your book not foreign to the t object of the society, which has invariably been, to lead their countrymen to think for themselves on the momentous subject of government, and thus to produce an universal and fondly anticipate, in idea, the numerous bles-practical conviction of one great truth, that sings mankind will enjoy, if you succeed, as without a real representation of the people, we ardently wish, the triple alliance (not offrequently renewed, there can be no ettectusl crowns, but) of the people of America, France, and Britain, will give freedom to Europe, and peace to the whole world.

GARROW 2045 “ The Society for Constitutional Information in London, to the National Convention of France. 
GARROW 2046  Servants of a sovereign People, and Benefactors of Mankind, We rejoice that You, revolution has arrived at that point of perfection which will permit us to address you by this title; it is the only one that can accord with the character of true legislators. Every successive epoch in your affairs, has added something to the triumphs of liberty; and the glorious victory of the 10th of August, has fi prepared the way for a constitution, which we trust you will establish on the basis of reason and nature. 
GARROW 2047 ‘ Considering the mass of delusion accu mulated on mankind, to obscure their understandings, you cannot be astonished at the opposition you have met both from tyrants and from slaves. The instrument used against you by each of these classes is the same; for in the genealogy of human miseries, ignorance is at once the parent of oppression, and the child of submission. he events of every day are proving, that your cause is cherished by the people in all your continental vicinity; that a majority of each of those nations are your real friends, whose governments have tutored them into apparent foes, and that they only wait to be delivered by your arms from the dreaded necessity of fighting against them. 
GARROW 2048 “ The condition of Englishmen is less to be deplored—here the hand of oppression has not yet ventured completely to ravish the pen from us, nor openly to point the sword at you. From bosoms burning with ardour in your cause, we tender you our warmest wishes for the full extent of its progress and success. It is indeed a sacred cause ; we cherish it as the pledge of your happiness, our natural and nearest friends; and we rely upon it as the bond of fraternal union to the human race, in which union our own nation will surely be one of the first to concur. 
GARROW 2049 “ Our government has still the power, and perhaps the inclination, to employ hirelings to cuntradict us; but it is our real opinion, that we now speak the sentiments of a great majority of the English nation
JOHNSON 2050 The people here are wearied with imposture, and worn out with war; they have learned to reflect, that both the one and the other are the offspring of unnatural combinations in society as relative to systems of government, not the result of the natural temper of nations, as relative to each others happiness. 
GARROW 2051 “ Go on, legislators, in the work of human happiness— the benefits will in part be ours, but the glory shall be all your own It is the reward of your perseverance, it is the prize of virtue. The sparks of liberty preserved in England for ages like the coruscations of the noi aurora, served but to show the darkness visible in the rest of Europe. The lustre of the American republic, like an effulent morning, rose with increasing vigour, ut still too distant to enlighten our hemisphere, till the splendour of the French revolution burst forth upon the nations, in the full fetvour of a meridian sun, and displayed in ahe midst of the European world, the practical result of principles which philosophy had sought in the shade of speculation, and which experience inust every where confirm. It dispels the clouds of prejudice from all people, reveals the secrets of all despotism, and creates a new character in man. e 
GARROW 2052 “ In this career of improvement, your example will be soon followed; for nations rising from their lethargy, will reclaim the rights of man, with a voice which man cannot resist. (Signed by order of the Society) “ SemPitt, chairman, “D. Avams, secretary.

After which, the president gave us the kiss of fraternity. in behalf of the French nation, which we returned in behalf of our society. The scene was truly interesting to ener feeling of humanity, and drew tears fro crowded assembly. It gave rise to reflexions, which can scarcely be conceived by men in any other circumstance of life; it was the reconciliation of brothers, who had long been excited to a mortal enmity by misunderstanding and mutual imposition, The .wounds which had bled for ages were closed and forgot, while the voice of nature declared they shoald never more be opened.

GARROW 2077 “ Innumerable societies of a similar nature are now forming in every part of England, Scotland, and Ireland. They excite a spirit of universal inquiry into the complicated abuses of government, and the simple means of reform. 
GARROW 2078 “ After the example which France has fren, the science of revolutions will be renlered easy, and the progress of reason will be rapid. It would not be strange, if, in a period far short of what we should venture to predict, addresses of felicitation should cross the seas to a mational convention in England.

The sons of liberty through the world will never forget their obligations to the English nation. 
GARROW 2083 “ The shades of Pym, of Hampden, and of Sydney, are hovering over your heads ; and. the moment cannot be distant, when the people of France will offer their congratulations to a national convention in England. Too long has the torch of discord enflamed ad-the English and the French; while the ambition of kings, fomenting national aversions, compelled them -to forget, that nature has produced none but brothers. 
GARROW 2084 “ Your islands, it is said, were severed from the continent by a great convulsion of the globe; but liberty, established on the two shores of the narrow sea which divides us, will repair the breach, and restore the two nations to the harmony and friendship for which nature has designed them.

GARROW 2108 “How glorious will it be for France and England to have formed alone a confede: destructive of tyrants, and to have purc! at the price of their blood, the liberty of Europe—we may say more, of the whole universe. 
GARROW 2109 “ Courage, brethren and friends. It is for you to follow us in the glorious and hazardous career of the revolution of the world. Can ye any longer groan under the yoke of a government, that has nothing of liberty but the name? For, although your land was inhabited before others by freemen, can ye, without illusion, consider your government as i “ Will ye content yourselves with a partial freedom ie Will the ‘Tagliah be satisfied with principles? Will that bold nation, that has produced philosophers the most profound, and that first of all perceived the 5 i rays of reason, remain a spectatrix in so noble a cause. 
GARROW 2110 “No, brethren and friends, no! you will soon lift yourselves up against that perfidious court of St. James's, whose infernal policy, like to that which found its tomb in the Thuilleries, has made so many victims in our two nations, and-does disunite them perpetually to rule over them. 
GARROW 2111 “ Your love for liberty has fixed your attention upon the wants of our defenders; your generosity toward them is a title to the acknowledgments of the republic. We are impatient to furnish you the same advantages, The Popular societies of France desire ardently the epoch that shall permit them to address their vows to the national assembly of Great Britain, and to offer to the bayonets, and pikes. he members composing the Committee of Correspondence : “ AUSELME Raspaup, “ Ausor, SEBRET, ‘¢ ABUISE, Perrin AGLEAN. “ Voi,

Then France and England shall form together a treaty of union as lasting as the course of the Seine and the Thames. Then there, as here, there shall exist no other reign but that of liberty, equality, and friendship.

GARROW 2121 he Society of the Friends of Liberty and Equality, established at Macon, department of the Saone and Loire, to the Constitutional 
GARROW 2122 Society of London. Yes, citizens, our brethren and friends, the 10th of August, 1792, shall be distinguished in the annals of the world as the day of the triumph of liberty. “ Our first revolution did but show to us the salutary principles of the imprescriptible i of man: except the unprincipled, and the enemies of humanity, adopted them with enthusiasm. It was then that we formed ourselves into a society, in order the better to impress them upon ourselves, and afterwards to teach them to our fellowcitizens. 
GARROW 2123 “Our first. constitution had consecrated them, but had not always taken them for its base. The dominion of the passions, the force of habit, the impression of prejudices, and the power of the intrigues employed in our Constituent Assembly, found the secret to preserve sufficient authority to our tyrants, to extinguish, at some time, the sacred rights of nature, and to re-establish despotism on its throne of iron. 
GARROW 2124 “ But royalty, thus preserved, was not content with the victory that had secured to it the greatest number of the corrupt persons who surrounded it. It was impatient to rea the fruits that it appeared to promise iteelk But its too great eagerness has hastened its ruin, and secured the triumph of reason. 
GARROW 2125 he French, proud of their new existence, soon perceived the fault of their first legislators, became sensible of the imperfection of its first laws—saw that they made a surrender of the rights of liberty and equality which they had embraced, they roused themselves anew to demand, at length, laws impartial and humane. 
GARROW 2126 “From thence the necessary day of the tenth of August 1792. From thence a second revolution, but a revolution which is only the completion of the first, which has received our vows and our oaths, and which we will bless for ever, if it leads us, as we hope it will, to the happiness of the nation, to the constant maintenance of liberty and equality. 
GARROW 2127 “ Let intriguers, tools, and tyrants calumniate us; we despise them too much to condescend to answer them, and seek for their esteem. 
GARROW 2128 hat which flatters us, is, the interest that you take in our labours, your attention to contribute to the success of our arms; we desire your esteem, we are proud of your approbation. 
GARROW 2129 “ We smile at the expression of the sentiments that you manifested to our representatives: we behold a nation of brethren rouse itself to support the cause of humanity: we behold the brave English adopt our principles, become our friends ; we say to ourselves with pleasure, soon will they become our allies, and, uniting our efforts, we shall go on to deliver the universe from the yoke of tyrants—to restore the nations to reason and nature.

THOMAS_WOOD 2136 “ Paris, September 20th, 1792. 
THOMAS_WOOD 2137 “ My dear Sir, We arrived safe at this place yesterday to dinner; and, having met with no interruption on ourjourney, by night or by day, since we left Dover, except delay at Abbeville, Amiens, Clermont, and for want of horses, which the emigrants have wore out. Paris is now quiet, though it was illuminated, and the guards under arms from an apprehension of the people visiting the Tem4 le to destroy Louis and his wife: the latter raves it, and will to the last; the former is insensible to his fate. The night, however, peste over in silence; and this evening the onvention will meet, and the National Assembly take their leave. About three hundred of the present assembly are returned to the Convention; the rest retire with execrations. Mr. Paine made his appearance in the National Assembly last night, which excited great curiosity among both men and women, and occasioned no small interruption. The first who embraced him was Cambon, who last night made a most excellent speech on the subject of the jewels, plate, &c. found in the churches, &c. in order to have them melted, as hitherto most infamous use had been made of them, by pawning them to the Jews, &c. to raise money for the emigrants. This motion was become the more necessary, as, a few nights ago, that is, on the morning of Tuesday, 40 men armed, entered the Thuilleries, and carried off 30 millions of livres. The gates of Paris have been shut, and a search made: more than a million has been found. The treachery of Louis is so great, that the indignation of the people cannot be wondered at. He has anticipated the civil list a year and a half, and mortgaged his domains for six years. The bankers, and others who have advanced the money, will be ruined. Byde is gone. I will inform myself, between this and Monday, of every thing that is passing, and by that post send you a particular account of the 10th, the truth of which is not yet known in England, or, if known, concealed or misrepresented to blacken the revolution. Without the affair of the 10th, liberty was over. Iam sorry to learn that the conduct of your friend gen. M. is not well spoken of. He was in the Thuilleries all night of the 9th; and he and captain Sampson left about eight o’clock in the morning ; and there is no doubt but he regulated the troops, and disposed them in order to attack. Hig conduct was winked at, out of respect to the English. He is now with Dumourier’s army, which ig 80,000 strong; and it is expected that an account will arrive this day of an engagement between him and the Prussians, as general Kellerman had, by a forced march over the mountains, joined him when he last wrote; within nine miles of which, the Prussians being informed of his approach, made an attack before the junction, and was repulsed. There are 500,000 troops now upon the frontiers, The language of the king of P is cl from that of threats to soothing; and he has artfully endeavoured to persuade the troops, that, as they are unable to defend themselves, and are betrayed by their generals, they had better lay down their arms. Few Prussian deserters have come over; but a great number of Austrians have entered. have this moment read a letter from general Money, who expects every moment the attack of the Prussians. They have been joined by a t body of Brabanters, who have all along fought with uncommon bravery. The post 1s going out, and compels me to hasten to a conclusion. We dine to-day with Pethion. Paine has entered his name on the roll of parlisment, and went through the forms of office with a great deal of nonchalance. We are well lodged, and, besides our bed-rooms, have an entertaining room for members to be shown into: several have called this morn ing. We are to give ten livres a day. The clerk of parliament has this moment been here—Mr. Rose, a relation of the notorious George Rose, I have nothing more to add, but that Mr. Paine is in good spirits ; aud indeed the flattering reception he has met with all through France, could not failof it. It is more than I describe.Ibelieve he is rather fatigued with the kissing. Pethion still retains his popularity. Robespierre has been attacked in the primary assembly, and told that he was the most dangerous man in France, and that a good citizen ought to blow his brains out. The English, I understand, showed great pusillanimity. Tell Vaughan, his friend Losh was, for three or four days before he left the hotel, very uneasy, and thought he should never see England again. Mr. Watt is here, and very civil. What is become of Dr. Maxwell?’ is the a Al ways your's, .R Addressed, “ John Horne Tooke, esq. 
GARROW 2138 Now I will give some ‘account of what these transactions of the 10th of August were, which are stated as necessary to liberty. 
GARROW 2139 Were you i: Paris op the 10th of August, 1792
HUSKISSON 2140 Yes, I was. I believe you resided in the house of the oe salons lord Gower ?—I did. you been in Paris any time previous to the 10th of August’—From the month of July, 1790, so good as to state shortly, what the facts were, which are described as the transactions of the 10th of August, as they relate to transactions at Paris and Versailles, as they fell under observation.—On the 10th of August I iad on opportunity of observing very little, ae I did net go out durmg the contest that took place in the course of that morning. 
GARROW 2141 What was the nature of that which you describe as a contest, which kept you at home
HUSKISSON 2142 I heard a firing, and I saw smoke. I saw afterwards sume of the out-buildings on fire at the 3 and I saw people running with their arms towards that part of the town. 
GARROW 2143 What did you find had occasioned the firing; from what had it ded, the firing of and the firing the buildings
HUSKISSON 2144 The firing of arms, I understood, ‘posers from persons who wished to enter the palace, and also from those who opposed their entrance. 
GARROW 2145 Was the palace, at that time, the residence of the king and his family 
HUSKISSON 2146 I believe it was. 
GARROW 2147 Can you describe any other transactions of that day, which came within your knowled; at the moment, or that came within your o! servation afterwards
HUSKISSON 2148 I saw, in the evening of that day, the governor of the palace, who came to my lodgings to shelter himself ; and he described to me : 
GARROW 2149 In point of fact, the governor of the palace took shelter at your house 
HUSKISSON 2150 He did. 1 went out in the evening, about nine o’clock, and I attempted 
GARROW 2151 I submit to your lordship, that what the governor of the palace said at the time of taking shelter at the house of this English gentleman, is evidence. 
EYRE 2152 Do not let us go into every particular of a transaction at that distance. 
HOTHAM 2153 It is a history that is pretty publicly known. 
GARROW 2154 You were saying that you went out in the evening
HUSKISSON 2155 Yes, about nine e’clock. I did not see any thing worth mentioning. I went towards the bridge that leads to the palace, where I was stopped by some centinels from approaching nearer. I saw the out-buildings of the palace were then burning. 
EYRE 2156 The whole of it is, that there was a great tumult, a great slaughter, and that the king and his family sheltered themselves at the Convention, and were not restored to their liberty afterwards. 
GARROW 2157 Just so—we are perfectly content to take it so. 
GARROW 2158 Mr. Huskisson.
HUSKISSON 2159 Every body knows that. 
GARROW 2160 I believe every body knows, except the jury. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2161 I propose ta read 4wo letters, found in the possession of Mr. Horne Tooke, and draughts of two letters in Mr. Tooke’s hand-writing. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2162 Do you know in whose band-writing that og’ is
HUSKISSON 2163 I think it, by the character, to be Mr. Tooke’s. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2164 Have you seen him write 
HUSKISSON 2165 I have, and delieve it to be his, though I did not see him write it. Look ‘at this paper?—The same handwriting. 
GARROW 2166 Look at these four papers—see if you find your name upon these, and whether you seized these 
HUSKISSON 2167 Upon these two only. 
GARROW 2168 Are you one of his majesty’s messengers
HUSKISSON 2169 No; I am clerk to the public-office on beth-street, Whitechapel. 
GARROW 2170 Were you present when these pape were found
HUSKISSON 2171 Yes; they were found at Mr. Horne Tooke’s house at Wimbledon. 
GARROW 2172 Was that after Mr. Tooke was taken into custody
HUSKISSON 2173 Yes, it was. 
GARROW 2174 Where were they found
HUSKISSON 2175 Some were found in bureaus, and some in other places. 
GARROW 2176 Who were present when they were found
HUSKISSON 2177 Mr. Frost and Mr. Vaughan. 
GARROW 2178 Did they attend as friends of Mr. Tooke 
HUSKISSON 2179 They did. 
GARROW 2180 You got the keys, and you found these papers 
HUSKISSON 2181 These two papers (the two not spoken to by Mr. Thornton) are marked by me, as found in the house of Mr. Tooke. 
GARROW 2182 Draft of a Letter from Mr. Tooke to the Mayor of Paris, in Mr. Tooke’s handwriting. 
GARROW 2183 “ Sir, You are in no want of friends in England, who ardently wish to be useful to French hberty. But we wish to know some one of your friends, who resides in Lond in whom you have an entire confidence, an to whom we may give our money, in the assurance that it will be remitted to you without delay, and without fraud. Mr. Frost, to whom I entrust this letter, is going to set out immediately with Mr. Paine, for Paris, and allows me no time for ceremony, if it were necessary. I request you tu send me the name of some Frenchman, in London, mer- — chant, or other, for the purpose above mentioned. Wecan now begin the public contribution towards our patriotic gift with 1,000,, sterling; and I have no doubt but it. will amount in time to several thousands. 
GARROW 2184 “If you consider this step in the same point of view that we do, you will see in it much use to the common cause of England and France. I entreat you to give me yeur sentiments on the subject, and to paint out to me the means by which I may be useful to you. J. Horne Tooxs, 
GARROW 2185 “ Brothers and Friends, Liberty is a bond which ought to unite men, and which will one day unite all nations. These are preparing those great revolutions which disseminate useful truths. Thus the philosophical societies make all despots tremble. You have the glorious advantage of deserving the hatred of your government. The league of tyrants will never be able to resist the power of reason. Continue your precious labours —employ yourselves in the enfranchisement and the happiness of the human race. You will find in the French, worthy fellow labourers

GARROW 2214 Look at these printed papers and’say, whether from their appearance you take them, to be the French papers of those dates
HUSKISSON 2215 They have every appearance of being similar to those which I took in, while at Paris, and afterwards in London. 
GARROW 2216 You are I understand a bookseller 
HUSKISSON 2217 Yes. sy nets is your shop?—In Gerrard-street, 
GARROW 2218 Your shop was chiefly employed in selling foreign publications I believe
HUSKISSON 2219 Yes, and not only foreign publications, but all sorts of works, and as to the newspapers which I sold, they were the same that came through the channel of the post office, and by others. 
GARROW 2220 You sold French newspapers
HUSKISSON 2221 Yes. 
GARROW 2222 And these French newspapers came by the channel of the post from France, and by the channel of private conveyance
HUSKISSON 2223 Great part of them came from Paris, by the packet, then sent to Millet and Fector, and then forwarded by the mail coach. I received no apers, but what were duly opened at the stom-house at Dover. You are a native of France, I perceive ?—No, I beg your pardon, I am a native of Switzerland. 
GARROW 2224 You are acquainted with the French language 
HUSKISSON 2225 Yes. 
GARROW 2226 You probably have had many thousand French newspapers pass through your hands
HUSKISSON 2227 I have. 
GARROW 2228 Whether you are acquainted with thaf paper the Nationale Gazette, or Universclle Moniteur 
HUSKISSON 2229 Perfectly well, I have had a great many of them. 
GARROW 2230 Did you ever know of any of these French papers with the French titles, and in that shape, reprinted in England 
HUSKISSON 2231 I have never known it. 
GARROW 2232 From the paper, from the type, and from the general appearance of these papers which you hold in your hand, comparing them with the recollection of those which passed through cu hand, in the way of your trade, do you lieve these to be the French Moniteur, published in France, and conveyed to this country, in the way you have stated
HUSKISSON 2233 Perfectly so, and more than that, there are many connexions in London, through which the veracity of this, might be compared. 
GARROW 2234 We are not permitted to compare them with others; is that French paper, and is it rinted with French types
HUSKISSON 2235 It is the real aris paper, printed in Paris by Mr. Pilnewood who is the proprietor of it. I have received hse immediately from Mr. Pilnewood’s own ands,

HUSKISSON 2247 ranslation. 
HUSKISSON 2248 “ The question submitted to your deliberation: is of the highest importance to public order, of the greatest difficulty in lepalstan, of the utmost delicacy in politics, absolutely necessary to liberty, and connected with whatever is held most sacred by the nation
HUSKISSON 2249 The calmness which has prevailed in the deliberations, for some days past, forbodes that it will be decided according to justice and reason.—It will not escape history, this contrast between kings, who often, amidst the dissition of courts, signed proscriptions, or the Seat warrant of a thousand citizens; and the representatives ofthe people, whodeliberate with wisdom and caution on the punishment of a single despot.—It is the destiny of kings to be the occasion of the calamities of the people, whether they remain on their thrones, or whether they are precipitated from them. 
HUSKISSON 2250 he people of Paris, by making an holy insurrection against him , the king, on the 20th of August, deprived him of his character of inviolability—The people of the other departments applauded this insurrection, and adopted the result of it—The people have, therefore, already interposed to destroy the royal inviolability —Louis was invested by the tacit consent of the people, with a constitutional inviolability; their tacit consent has deprived' him of the same, and is therefore as lawful as the grant of it.The inviolability of the king cannnot be absolute; it is only relative, and for the end of maintaining the independence of the constituted authorities. 
HUSKISSON 2251 “ The people is the sovereign. 
HUSKISSON 2252 “ A convention differs from a legislature in this respect: a legislature is only a species of superintending magistracy; a moderator of the powers of government: a convention, on the contrary, is a representation of the sovereign
HUSKISSON 2253 The members of the legislative assembly acted, in August, upon these principles; and they declared, in their account of their motives for calling a national convention, that they saw but one measure which could save France ; namely, to have recourse to-the supreme will of the people, and to invite the people to exercise immediately that inalienable right of sovereignty, which the constitution had acknowledged, and which it could not subject to any restriction.—The public interest required, that the will of the People should be manifested in the opinion of & national corivention, formed of representatives, invested by the people with unlimited ers. The will of the peopte is manifested yy the opinion of this convention —The convention pee assembled, is itself that sovereign will which ought to prevail.—It would be contrary to every principle, if the expression of the general will did not reside in the convention alone.

HUSKISSON 2256 Is it not the very nature of 2 national convention to be the temporary image of the nation; to unite, in itself, all the powers of government, to employ them against the enemies of liberty, and to distribute them ins new social compact, called a constitution ?—Behold that Constituent Assembly, which, though abominably calumniated at present, laid (in spite of the shameful revision of the laws) the first foundation of your liberty. Behold it alone, with its revolutionary genius; it broke through every impediment, exceeded its delegated authority, created its own pow: according to the exigencies of liberty, to the wants of the people; destroyed all prejudices by the force of that public opinion to which it gave birth, obliterated all privileges, abolished all parliaments, charged the form of all property, as well as the sign of all value, and made a perjured king its prisoner. —Nothing was wanting to immortalize thas assembly, but to have delivered France from the calamity of kingly government, and to have relieved you from the duty of judging the last of your kings.

MACLEAN 2303 “ gentlemen, It is with peculiar satisfaction, we are favoured with your correspondence (not merely because you are so, although you are better fitted to diffuse knowledge) but be, cause you areembarked in the same magnanimous cause, which demands with alacnity the attention of every individual; and itis with the utmost regret we see so many, either from ignorance, or something worse, who are inimical to their own interest ; for nothing contributes so much to support the oppressor, as the ignorance of the oppressed ; for which purpose the flood-gates have been opened Panually, till, by degrees, the streams of corruption have nearly overflowed the land: such as bounty acts, borrowing, qualification, and septennial acts, besides standing armies, excise and ittin laws, with various others too painful for reflection, without credit to the framers thereof, and without advantage to society. We do not presume to recapitulate these abuses for Pipe information, but being too experimentally acquainted with them, we wish to find out a method of redress. At present we see a great propriety in universal suffrage, and annual elections, but we beg you will be obliging enough to inform us of what ou have collected of the sense of the people yy your correspondents. We have to inform you, that our worthy Corresponding Societies of London, have recently submitted three propositions for our investigation. First, whether -a petition to parliament, or an address to the king, or aconvention, : 
MACLEAN 2304 “Permit us briefly to state our views for our revisal ; and with respect to the first, we hold we are a conquered people. Wehave tamely submitted to the galling yoke, and resistance in the present circumstances is vain. We cannot act the man, and as necessity has no law, we think ourselves under that degrading necessity to state our grievances to the House of Commons, with a request for redress, and should they refuse to grant our reasonable petition, we have still got (no thanks to them) a formidable engine, that will convey the insylt to the remotest parts of the kingdom. As to the propriety of the second, we wish to submit to your superior judgment, and should esteem it a favour to be informed of the result; forat present we are dubious of its good consequences, Lastly, a convention, and ol ! that the period were arrived !—but in the present state of affairs, alas! it’s impracticable: yet this is the object we pursue, and esteem any other means only in subordination to, and as having a tendency to accomplish that desirable end. 
MACLEAN 2305 “ We wish to be in unison with our brethren and fellow-labourers, and should be glad of any information as soon as it is convenient: and we beg your advice whether it is’ necessary, as soon as possible, to collect signatures te a petition for a: real representation of the qfer and by whom to present it, whether Coke, Mr. Burch, or any of the Friends of the People; and whether it is attended with any expense. Our. members are both inimical to the business. 
MACLEAN 2306 “ We can give you no accurate statement of the representation in our neighbourhood, only observe, that it is equally farcical here as elsewhere.

GARROW 2323 “ The following letter was produced and read. To S, Butler and a. Bond, esqrs. 
GARROW 2324 “ gentlemen, It is not easy for men, who feel strongly and sincerely, to convey those feelings by letter. We therefore rely an your Conceiving for us much of that which we are unable to express to you. We think, however, that we shall be guilty of a great omission, did we neglect the opportunity of sending you by Mr. Hamilton Rowan, t ihe honest tribute of our esteem and admiration, for your brave and manly resistance to the’ usurped jurisdiction of the Irish aristocracy. 
GARROW 2325 “ Permit us to offer you our thanks, and our grateful acknowledgment of your efforts, in what we consider as a common cause, while we lament our inability of proving ourselves useful in your defence. Although we are of different kingdoms, still we are but one peor ; and as the freedom of one continent as spread its influence to Europe, so on the other hand, we are persuaded, that the establishment of despotism in Ireland, must end in the slavery of Great Britain. But the light of liberty is not confined to one shore, or one latitude. 
GARROW 2326 “ We know that it is easier to admire than to practise those virtues that tend to the public benefit. 
GARROW 2327 “ Yet so long as the exertions of a few courageous men must influence the minds of at least the independent and thinking part of the community, we are assured that their labour is not fruitless. We trust, therefore, the time will soon arrive, when the abuse of power in either nation, will have no other consequence than the ruin of those who have committed that injustice. We hope, and we doubt not of soon seeing the day, when the post of honour shall be no longer that af obloquy and punishment; but when those who have risked their liberty and fortune in the cause of their countrymen, may find pro tection in the undisputed, uninterrupted exercise of trial by jury, with a full and adequate Tepresentation of the people in parliament,

The honour you do us in supposing that we arc better fitted than yourselves for the promotion of political knowledge, we must disclaim ; because we observe, with the greatest pleasure, that our country correspondents ve too much zeal and information to want success in their public endeavours, whether at Notwich, at Sheffield, at Manthester, or elsewhere throughout the nation.

It is however no small consolation to find, that others are not wanting in every part of the nation of an opposite chaacter, who are ready to remedy, by all laudable and honourable means, the defect in our representation, the usurped extension of the duration of parliaments, and other grievances such as you notice in your letter. 
MACLEAN 2339 That the constitution of England has no more of that character it once possessed ; that the supposed democracy of the country has become a matter of property and privilege ; and that we have therefore no longer that mixt government which our adversaries are praising, when they know it is no longer in our possession, are facts notorious and indisputable.

But if we regard the policy of such a petition, it may, in our apprehension, be well worth considering as a warning voice to our present legislators, and as a signal for imitation to the majority of the people. Should such a plan be vigorously and generally pursued, it would hold out a certainty to our fellow-countrymen, that we are not a handful of individuals unworthy of attention or consideration, who desire the restoration of the ancient liberties of England ; but, on the contrary, it might bring into light that host of well-meaning men, who in the different towns and counties of this realm are silently but seriously anxious for reformation in the government.

GARROW 2570 “Resolved, That the following address be sent to Messrs. Muir, Palmer, Skirving, Margarot, and Gerrald: 
GARROW 2571 “ Friends and Fellow Citizens, Although we have hitherto been the silent, yet we have by no means been the unconcerned spec tators of your conduct and sufferings. We have seen and approved of your exertions for your country’s -happiness—We have marked with honest indignation, every step that your enemies have taken to bring you to your present situation. Your enemies are the enemies of Pugtrc Liperty, the men who are conspiring against the happiness of mankind. The cause in which you are embarked, and to which you have borne an honvurable testimony, is worthy of every exertion, and its importance to the world too great, to expect its accomplishment without opposition. 
GARROW 2572 he history of liberty, for whose sake you are doomed to a long and ynmerited exile, will afford, in the present instance, that consolation that former martyrs to the same cause have experienced ; the consolation, that you will not, you cannot, suffer in vain. 
GARROW 2573 “ Men may perish, but truth will prevail ; neither persecution, por banishment, nor death itself, can finally injure the progress of those principles which involve the general ppiness of man. 
GARROW 2574 “ While, therefore, we join every friend to humanity in lamenting what you have already endured, and with anxious hearts, anticipate the perils to which you may be exposed in a barren and uncultivated country, yet we can rejoice that the sources of happiness are limited to no place, but are as extensive as the dominion of Gop; under the protection of that Great Brinc, may you at all times, and in all places, feel the pleasure that arises from conscious integrity. 
GARROW 2575 “ Fellow-citizens, we assure you that the memory of your virtues shall never be effaced from our breasts; the cause for which you have struggled, is a glorious cause, the world that has witnessed your exertions, shall witness ours also 
GARROW 2576 “A full and fair representation of the people of Great Britain, we seek with all the ardour of men and Britons, for the sake of which we are not only ready to act with vigour and unanimity, but we trust, prepared also to suffer with consluncy. 
GARROW 2577 “ Qur best wisires will ever attend you, and we do believe that the day is not very distant, when we shall again receive you on the British shores, the welcome children of a Free and Hapey Country. By Order of the Society. 
GARROW 2578 o the Chairman of the Society for Constitutional Information. “ Surprise Transport, April 16, 1794. 
GARROW 2579 Fellow Citizens; I have long since looked upon your society with admiration and esteem, considering it as the source and school of most of the political information, which, by the blessing of God, has overspread the island. I have been instructed by the wisdom of your papers, and animated by the spirit of your addresses. That my conduct is epproved by such a society, is my pride and my joy. “ You say (es the consideration is the eupport of my life), that the history of liberty will prove by the experience of her former martyrs, that sufferings in her cause cannot be en vain, That my sufferings may not be in wain, I ardently wish that the eyes of my countrymen were open, not: only to the illegality and despotism of my sentence, but to the alarming measures ty which it was brought about. My jury was three times packed by the servants of the crown before tt vet upon me. In the first instance by the sheriff's deputy, placemen immediately apinted by the crown; in the second, by the erownagent, ford advocate, ec, at Edinburgh; 
GARROW 2580 and in the third, by the justiciary lords, who tried thecause. These last, arbitrarily appoint the fitteen particular persons who are to sit upon the accused. The strongest objections are mere air, as the lords alone are the judges of the validity of them. A majority of the fifteen condemns. If, therefore, ministry, with theig all-extensive influence, can in three countries find only eight servile tools subservient to their views, the fortune, the liberties, the lives of all Scotland are at their mercy. Trial is condemnation. ‘The sentence is appointed hefore-hend by the mipister, and mine was known a full week at Edinburgh before it was uttered. They can tuin, or even murder whom please. This infamous robbery of the first right of Englishmen, a trial by jury fairly chosen, I have endeavoured to set forth in a letter to the editor of the Morning Chronicle, last October or November, of the date (if I remember rightly) of the 22nd or 27th, of which I now avow myself the author, to which I beg leave to draw the attention of the Suciety for Constitutional Information. Farewell, tellowcitizens

GARROW 2582 “ Surprize Transport, Spithead, April 17, 1794 
GARROW 2583 “ Mr. President, Permit me, si, to assure you, and the respectable Constitutional Society, that the very consoling uddress, re ceived agreeably to their resolutiun of the 28th ult. has excited in me, as also in the hearts of each of my fellow martyrs, for the important cause of universal suffrage, end annual parliaments, the most lively sensations of gratitude and esteem. The Constituttopal Society was the foremost of true patriots to raise the Standard of Reform, for the purpose of redeeming from the contaminating and contagious influence of corruption, those venerable, but almost lost principles of the British constitution, Wrought into it by the blood and irresistible energies of our fore fathers, many of whom, rather than that these principles, upon which depend the virtue and felicity of Society should be lost sight of, exhibited their high esteem of them on scaffolds and in dungeons; that all, even the most callous spectators might be persuaded, that the truths for which they did not reckon even their lives too dear a sacrifice, were surely worthy of the unprejudiced inves tigation of all. Your remark therefore is just, and it is very soothing to us, “ We do not, we cannot suffer fur such cause in votn. The resentment of our enemies, driving them into such absurd measures towards men, against whom vice of any kind is not evea alleged, must have moved in every unprejudiced mind, the restless question; Why? Why are men who seek the improvement of their species thrown with felens into dungeons? And full information must follow sincere inquiry, and at length convert all to the side of truth and righteousness. I therdfore cheerfully consent to suffer to promote the general good. 
GARROW 2584 “We are blamed as baving yremabsecly, at least, exposed ourselves to the necessity of sealing by our sufferings, the cause we would promote. If in this case we have erred, I will readily take the whole blame, as having strained every nerve to press forward the measure of a general convention, as being the only means to avert impending ruin. I sought to erouse and alarm my countrymen to consider their extreme danger. I feared that the necessity for such association would be on ws before we were prepared for it. Besides, what measure could possibly interest so much the public inquiry? what has so much increased public information? It excited counter associations, and caused every man to see who were on the side of truth, and who were on the side of corruption: t exposed the selfish and interested designs of the one, and the unfeigned proseeution of the public good by the other.Ispeak so with the greater eonfidence before a Society that must have marked the progress of information eo long under their own auspices. You must know that this progress, the exciting the inquiry of the public, has been more extensively effected during the last year, then during the ten preceding ones. The eause was the General Convention. The terror and hatred of mimistry to it proves the truth. Whe then would have refused even his life to have been instrumental in promoting so much good ? 
GARROW 2585 “Your explicit approbation of our conduct has prompted this self-exultation; forgive therefore my freedom. I may be mistaken. The important revolution in human affairs, to which every Chrietian looks with anxious hope, may be yet distant. If it is, tyranny may still triumph. But God forbid it. It would then be better to die than to live. But though I hope the reverse, I know, as you justly observe, ‘ That the importance of the cause of freedom is too great to the world, “to expect its accomplishment without oppo“ sition,’ and the opposition of despairing tyranny will be dreadful, it will be destructive; and why
HUSKISSON 2586 because nothing but its ruining last struggle will rouse mankind trom their idle dream of security. They regard wet, they pily not its present victins. They off evil far from themseives, and enceovertakes them suddeniy, ‘ when their etrencth is gone, and there is none -“ shut ep or left.’ Hold fast therefore what “you have attained. Your association alone ean prevent the dreadful consequence of such fadifference. Unirinc Love is the strength, 4 well as solace of mankind.

GARROW 2589 “ Worthy citizens, I will solace my mind, when drooping, with the kind assurance which you have vouchsafed by your masterly address, that I, with my brethren, have a place in your affection and prayers; aud I will believe with you, ‘ that the day is not very distant, when you will again receive us on British shores, the welcome children of a he and happy people.’ When indeed it shall demonstrated, ‘ hat our enemies are the “ enemies of public liberty ; the men who conspi“red against the happiness of mankind. But thoygh the gig are combined, though they should so far prevail as to scatter utterly in their vain apprehension the friends of truth, the Fine re of it which are already established, is the ‘ stone cut out without hands, and shall become a great mountain, ‘and fill the whole earth, for he who first commanded the light to shine out of darkness, is its almighty patron, 
GARROW 2590 “ Be assured, my dear brethren, that I have already realized the pleasures of conscious integrity, and can reflect with the sincerest satisfaction, that I was influenced in all my exertions for the cause of reform, by that benevolence which I would ever cultivate as ed principle of every kind of humaa excelnce. 
GARROW 2591 “ With sentiments of the most unfeigned esteem and respect, I am your sincere wellwisher, “ W. Bxravine. The President of the London 
GARROW 2592 Constitutional Society. 
GARROW 2593 “ Surprize Transport, April 24th, 1794. “ To the members of the Society for Constitutional Information, in London. “ That the spirit of Freedom is not extinuished, but still retains its former energy, in A fiance of the artifices and of the violence of despotism, is an object of high coi jon to my mind. Engaged in the sacred ceuse of man, individual man is an atom of little value; and in speaking of himself, when he recollects and contemplates the principles of his conduct, should disdain to make use of the term suffering. Wishout a vain affection, for myself, 1 disclaim the assumption of exdogrdiost merit. The man who has acted in obedience to the law of his own conscience, has simply discharged his duty ; and the contrary supposition would involve him in guj). I am deeply persuaded, that many of the men, whomnow address in a situation less cjrcumscribed, with abilities more powerful, but not with hearts more honest, after bering atchieved what I could sot accomplish, woul with the same cilent scorn have regarded each feeble attempt to shackle and to repress the freeborn mind.

They are a solemn and sure pledge of their future continuation. fn openey to the number, and 49 the rapidity of those tremendous scenes, which daily in succession pass before the eye; All, All of them deriving their existence from this violation of our constitutional rights, let your ardour in procuring a rectification of what is wrong be increased.

LAUZUN 2671 Tuos. Hanpy. 
LAUZUN 2672 mittee of Constitution of the London Corresponding Society, Printed for the use of the members.] ‘ 
LAUZUN 2673 “ Fellow Citizens , Knowing, from experience, that those who (through thre depraved state of what should be the representative body) are suffered to prey on the vitals of our country, derive the principal part of their success in opposing an equ: representation, from the active circulation of falsehoods, reSerine this, and other similar societies 3 we think it advisable, that you should give an explicit declaration of your PRINCIPLES and WISHES, which we conceive to be as follow : 
LAUZUN 2674 “1. That all men are by nature free, equal and independent of each other. 
LAUZUN 2675 “ 2. That, to enjoy all the advantages of civil society, it is not necessary that indivi duals should relinquish more of their natoral independence than is required to fulfil this injunction, Let the minority yield a friendly submission to the majority. 
LAUZUN 2676 “3. That no majority, however great, can justly deprive the minority of any part of their civil rights : wherever it is attempted, the social bond is broken, and the minority have a right to resist. 
LAUZUN 2677 “4. The civil rights of every individul are equality of voice, in the making of laws, and in the choice of persons by whom those laws are to be administered
HUSKISSON 2678 Equality before the law, whether in claiming its protection, or submitting to its sentence. Freedom to publish his opinion, to exercise his religious worship without molestation or restriction, and to enjoy his property, subject pay to such contributions as may be impartially levied for the public service. 
LAUZUN 2679 “ 8. Submission to any measure does not imply silence as to the propriety or impropriety thereof. 
LAUZUN 2680 “6. Every power intrusted to a magistrate, implies a responsibility for the exercise of that power. 
LAUZUN 2681 “7. The foregoing are not new, but are the otizinal principles of English government, 
LAUZUN 2682 “8. The total departure from the princi of equality in the election of the legislative body, commonly called the House of Commons, is the chief cause why the people of Britain are now ceprasen kt the Lege offoregoii inciples ; a in place thereof, inbour cRderaemicied systema of extortion and monopoly. 
LAUZUN 2683 “9 The Corn act—is a grievance immediately resulting from the restriction of the choice of fepesonnaiyes, Pp men of ion 
LAUZUN 2684 3 by it the price of bread in ge Laas fe sometimes much more than doubled; for whenever this country happens to be blessed with an abundant season, a pe of the taxes under which we groan, is applied to encourage the exportation, and advance the price of com. Thus we pay one tex to government, to give the landed man an oppottunity of laying on another. The hackneyed pretence for this act is, ‘ the welfare of the farmer.’ The real intention ofit is, to enable, the monopolizers of farms, to pay enormous rents, : 
LAUZUN 2685 “10. Game laws
HUSKISSON 2686 though teo evidently calculated to disarm the nation, may in general be attributed to the same restriction :, by them, even the farmer, on whose property the game is fed, is robbed of every constitutional right of a Briton, and subjected to the brutality of a bashaw in the form of a country justice, from whom there is no appeal. 
LAUZUN 2687 “11, Excise laws—and stamp creties (and the consequent systenr of spies and informers) equally repair to the professed principles the constitution, amd most extensive in their oppression ; ate often introduced merely as engines of corporation influence ; for in some instances, the produce of the tax does mot pay the expense of collection; were the sense of the nation fairly taken, it is impossible to believe but that whatever sum might be necessary for the public servite, it would be raised by means fess obnoxioas and less expensive, 
LAUZUN 2688 12. The mutiny act—which would never have existcd, had not the bulk of the people been excluded from representation. It reflects a charge of: hypocrisy on those who affect to bewail the late events in France, yet calmly view the defendcrs of their own country, subjected to every specics of fraud, insult, and cruelty. The military excellence of true republicans, in al! ages, proves it to be unnecessary. Convince a Briton, that he is about to fight for a country in which his rights are duly consulted, and the cat of nine-tails may be burnt by the hands ef the common hangman. 
LAUZUN 2689 “13. The impress service—equally cruel with the foregoing, is another effect of partial representation : it has lately been proved that the expense of this service, if applied to increase the seamen’s pay, would render impressing unnecessary; but it is more consistent with the government of a faction, to distribute the sum among the officers of corporations. 
LAUZUN 2690 “14. The ill effects of partial representation are not confined to men in private stations; we challenge contradiction when we assert that, in general, promotion, whether in the army, navy, or church, is the effect of parliamentary connection, and the reward of parliamentary prostitution. 
LAUZUN 2691 “15, We cannot entertain a doubt that th foregoing statement of grievances will be admitted as just by our countrymen at large, and also that an equal representation, by universal and‘annual suffrage, would tend immediately to redress them. It remains to prove that the difficulties said to attend such a scheme are merely the chimerical inventions of interested men. 
LAUZUN 2692 “16. Let us suppose all partial corporations (those badges FP eiavery abolished ; and consider the whole island as one corporation, divided into counties or cities, for the purposes of embodying and exercising militia, c. and for electing representatives, subdivided into districts, or townships, as nearly as convenient, in equal pruportion to the number of inhabitants. 
LAUZUN 2693 “ 17. Allow to each district, or township, one representative, and let it be subdivided into parishes, and every man entitled to a vote, be registered in the parish in which he resides. Large parishes may be subdivided into wards, or hamlets. 
LAUZUN 2694 “18, Let every voter give his vote in the arish in which he resides; let the votes be Fought in writing, and called for in succession, either alphabetically, by the name of the voters, or numerically by the wards and nuinbers of houses; either of these methods would prevent that source of riot, the practice of voting in party groups. 
LAUZUN 2695 “19, The truth of entry of every individual vote in each el would easily be examined, and the totals of the several parishes in each district so easily collected, that we scruple not to assert, a general election might be decided, with indisputable certainty, in twelve hours. 20. In saying the whole island should be considered as one corporation, we do nog wish to be understood as recommending that districts should choose their representatives from distant parts. On the contrary,’ we think the representative should always be a resident of the district, as his character would be better known to his constituents. Learsay characters are seldom any other than the blazouings of faction. 
LAUZUN 2696 “1. It is indispensable to good govern ment, that representatives should be paid for their service to the public. The want of oper and honourable reward, retards the exertion of laudable characters, and subjects the nation to the fraudulent and delusive practices of mock patriots. 92. ‘To those who are convinced of the propriety of the foregoing ideas, and only ask, ow shall we attain the practice of them? wa answer, dssociate. By so doing, you will better correct and strengthen each other’s opinions on the subject of liberty, and eventually abash the tools of corrupt influence and law, less power—effects which are not to be expected from the vague and desultory exertion ef individual opinions. 
LAUZUN 2697 laving thus stated’ what we conceive to be the sentiments of the society, we recoinmend that the members shall meet in divisions, consisting as nearly as convenient of thirty members each, and that the management of its affairs be vested in one COM MITTEE OF DELEGATES, one SELECT COMMITTERF, and one COUNCIL, subject to REFERENCE JO THE DIVISIONS and TRIAL BY JURY, as more particularly defined in the following sections : ;

BOWER 2776 Did be ever Judge, at any time, at your husbaiid's
HUSKISSON 2777 Yes. 
BOWER 2778 About, what tine was it he lodged at your husband's 
HUSKISSON 2779 lrom June to September, 1792. Did you ever see any of the sheets of that work while the printing was going on?—Yes, I have. 
BOWER 2780 Where did you see them 
HUSKISSON 2781 At our houss. 
BOWER 2782 Your husband printed them 
HUSKISSON 2783 No—he does Hot print. 
BOWER 2784 They were brought to your house as they Were printed off
HUSKISSON 2785 I cannut say I saw them printing, if that is the question. 
BOWER 2786 The question is, did you see those sheets brought to your husband's house in the proress of the printing 
HUSKISSON 2787 Yes, proof-sheetsIpave. Were they brought to your husband's house. at the time Mr. Paine was in England ?—They were. ‘ 
BOWER 2788 You sec there are two editions; one glazge and the other a smaller edition
HUSKISSON 2789 Yes. 
BOWER 2790  Of those works, perhaps, a profit was made
HUSKISSON 2791 There was tu have been; but I never had any profit: Mr. Paine told me that ke had told Mr. Johnson we were to receive the profit, 
BOWER 2792 The profit of one, or both
HUSKISSON 2793 The small one. 
BOWER 2794 Who was to receive the profit of the larger edition 
HUSKISSON 2795 Mr. Paine himself—He told me the. profit of the small one was to be divided between Mr. Symonds and my husband, iid je Paine come our house at the tume of the printing, gn Ou “aD: versation with bin ‘alieut itt—He iodeed ‘at my house at the time.—The small edition. wag published after he Ipft England; the large, one, I believe, did not make its appearance; but some of the proot-sheets I had seen before he went away; but it was not published before he left Eugland. 
ERSKINE 2796  Do you mean to swear that these are two of the very books that were printed for Symonds and your husband
MRS_RICKMAN 2797 lo the best of my knowledge. 
ERSKINE 2798 Can you take upon you to swear that these are part of the copics actually printed for bio, or may they not have been printed by somebody else, and be extremely like them? You have never read tie book thruugh, so as to be able to say that it isthe same You only see that this is intituled “ A Letter addressed -to the Addressers ; but there may be news in it, for any thing you know 
MRS_RICKMAN 2799 I know nothing about what it contains, 
ERSKINE 2800 Nor do you know it by the type, the paper, or any thing about it
MRS_RICKMAN 2801 I never saw it till it was in that state. This pamphict bas my hand-writing upon it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2802 From whom had you those books
MRS_RICKMAN 2803 Thcy were sent to me from, I suppuse, Mr. Johnson. 
ERSKINE 2804 I submit to your lordsbip, that this evidence is not sufficient to entitle them to read these pamphlets. I require, and Lask no more, that whenever it relates to this society or that, no matter what bearing it may have upun the issue of the cause, that the’ should be fixed by the same evidence as woul be necessary if they were tried tor the publication of a libel
MRS_RICKMAN 2805 I am sure the attorney general will not propose to have a looser proof in the case of high treasov, than in a misdemeanor. 
ERSKINE 2806 Mr. Attorney General. I have given no evidence yet, that I mean to give louse proof in this cause; Lut I by no means admit the Proposition to the eatent in which Mr. Erskine states it. 
BOWER 2807 Look at these two books—Did you publish one or both of them
MRS_RICKMAN 2808 They were printed with my name. 
BOWER 2809 With your knowledge 
MRS_RICKMAN 2810 No—without my knowledge. 
BOWER 2811 Ilow came they, do you know, to be printed with your pame—Did you know it at the time 
MRS_RICKMAN 2812 I never did know it, till L was written to, that that was the case—I was then in th country. 
BOWER 2813 At what time did you learn that these books were printed in. your name
MRS_RICKMAN 2814 I think it must be early in September, 1792. 
BOWER 2815 When you found. that they were printed with your name, did you make apy applica tion to any body to know why they were printed'with your name
MRS_RICKMAN 2816 I did. go to Mr. Jobason about that. 
BOWER 2817 Who, were tu hayg the profit ofthose books? 
BOWER 2818 —Thatnever knew but what I heard from my wife. 
BOWER 2819 Thomas Paine, we understand, lodged at your house 
MRS_RICKMAN 2820 He did. 
BOWER 2821 Did you ever see any of the sheets of those works while the printing was going on
MRS_RICKMAN 2822 No, not as the printing was going on. 
BOWER 2823 Were any proof-sheets, before the work was printed, brought to you
MRS_RICKMAN 2824 Never. 
BOWER 2825 Look at them, and tell us, whether either of them were the books that you priated 
MRS_RICKMAN 2826 I did not print the books at all. 
BOWER 2827 Did you publish them 
MRS_RICKMAN 2828 My name was put to them. 
BOWER 2829 Did you ever sell any of them
MRS_RICKMAN 2830 Yes, many. 
BOWER 2831 When did you sell any of those books? 
GIBBS 2832 Do you think that is evidence? I do not mean to moot the question, 
BOWER 2833 W hose hand-writing is it upon that copy 
MRS_RICKMAN 2834 My wife's hand-writing, I believe. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2835 In the course of our business, did you ever know of any other ok intituled “ An Address to the Addressers ? : 
ERSKINE 2836 I am sure this evidence is very imperfect—no man could be fined five pounds upon such evidence. 
ERSKINE 2837 Rickman
MRS_RICKMAN 2838 I never saw any book of that title but this. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2839 Are you a member of the Constitutional Society 
MRS_RICKMAN 2840 I was. 
ERSKINE 2841 Do you mean to take upon u to swear that these are two of the identical ooks that were sent to you for'sale
MRS_RICKMAN 2842 I do net. 
ERSKINE 2843 They may be exactly like them, or part like them, and yet be printed by others—lIs there any thing in the paper, or the type, that can enable you to swear to “them
MRS_RICKMAN 2844 No. 1 know nothing about printing. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2845 I should like to know how you could prove Locke’s Essay upon Human Understanding otherwise: Is that the book you sold at your shop as an Address to the Addressers, when such a book was asked for
MRS_RICKMAN 2846 It was such a kind of book as this. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2847 Look at the matter of the book ? 
ERSKINE 2848 Will your lordship allow a man to look at a book to which he cannot swear, in order to prove that that is the identical book ? 
EYRE 2849 It is not likely that he should have knowledge enough of the work to be able to answer the question; but if he could satisfy us that he knew that this book contained the identical words that were in the books that were commonly published under that title, to this purpose perhaps it might be evidence. 
ERSKINE 2850  Not having the original book here, could he be permitted to say, I do not bring the original book, but ] bring a copy ? 
EYRE 2851 If we could be Sure it was an exact copy of the same book it would be the same as the original; they are all copies. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2852 Suppose the Constitutional Socicty referred to Locke’s Essay upon the Human Understanding, how is it possible to identify that book without callin, the bookseller to prove that that is the boo which he sells for Locke’s Essay on the Human Understanding? 
EYRE 2853 As that would refer merely to the contents of the book, it would be very good evidence of the cgntents. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2854 This is what I am asking to. 
EYRE 2855 yYou certainly are, but whether he goes to the length of that is the question. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2856 Is that the boole you would have sold as the Address to the Aderessers, by Thomas Paine? 
EYRE 2857 But did he ever read it? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2858 I would not asks the question, unlesswas very well apprized, according to my information, of what kneow-‘ ledge this witness has of it. 
EYRE 2859 Go on in yous own course, 5 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2860 Do you know the contents of it
MRS_RICKMAN 2861 I have read the book. , : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2862 Look and see, whether by the conaents of it that is the book you would sell as the Address to the Addressers, by Thomas Paine, if you had been asked by a customer for Paine’s Address to the Addressers, without any explanation 
MRS_RICKMAN 2863 I should certainly sell this book as the Letter to the Addressers becausa it ig so entitled. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2864 Look at the contents of it; I will have an auswer to this if] make you read it through
MRS_RICKMAN 2865 I have certainly read the Letter to the Addressers. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2866 Look at the contents of the book in you: hand, and see if the contents are the same as the Letter to the Addressers which you read 
MRS_RICKMAN 2867 I have no doubt of it being the same. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2868 Is it not from the contents that you have: no doubt 
MRS_RICKMAN 2869 No, I confess it is from the com plexion of the book itself. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2870 You have been told to look at the contents, now look at the contents
MRS_RICKMAN 2871 I have looked at them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2872 Then have you any doubt that that is the: Letter to the Addressers 
MRS_RICKMAN 2873 Certainly, I have. no doubt. 
ERSKINE 2874  Is the reason why you have no doubt from: the general appearauce of the book, or have you no duubt because you have satisfied your understanding, by comparing that book witly the recollection you have of the former, having a perfect recollection of every sentence in the former 
MR_RICKMAN 2875 Not of every sentence. 
ERSKINE 2876 Then could you take upon you to swear, that it is exactly the same, word by word, and letter by letter
MR_RICKMAN 2877 I have not sworn that.

MR_RICKMAN 2954 By petitioning parliament first, that was his exhortation. , 
LAW 2955 What was the next measure, supposing their petition A la ? what was then to be done 
MR_RICKMAN 2956 I never heard any specific. plan pointed out by him. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2957 Put it into the hands of Mrs. Rickman. Did not you put them in the shop, and mark them as books to be sold? : 
MRS_RICKMAN 2958 I put my name on them. 
EYRE 2959 When 
MR_RICKMAN 2960 On Ziving them to Mr. White. 
EYRE 2961 In your shop 
MR_RICKMAN 2962 No. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2963 You had them in your shop as books to sell
MR_RICKMAN 2964 I had. 
ERSKINE 2965 I understand the Court to be of opinion (indzed I am not at all disposed to argue it) that this book must be taken, at present, to be the Letter addressed to the Addressers, upon the Proclamation, by Thomas Paine. What I wish to know, is, how it is proposed to make this taking it to be the book it is alleged to be, evidence in this cause. I perfectly understand why the Rights of Man were stated to be so, because ‘those whom this prosecution proposes to implicate in certain acts—the Corresponding Society, having come to a resolution to circulate it, therefore it was fair evidence. 
EYRE 2966 You had better hear how they propose to make it evidence. 
ERSKINE 2967 I understand that there is no evidence yet before the Court of any resolution of either of the societies to circulate this book, or to recommend it to reading. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2968 Y our lordship will sive me leave to observe, that Mr. Paine has en proved to be the author of the First Part of the Rights of Man; the Second Part of the Rights of Man—the Letter to the French nation; and I believe (though I am not accurate about that, becauseIwas not in court yesterday morning) a letter to Mr. ndas
MR_RICKMAN 2969 Mr. Paine is proved to be alsoa member of the Constitutional Society; Mr. Rickman, the witness, the person in whose hands this work was, in order to be sold, is also proved to be a member of the Constitutional Society. Now, under these circumstances, I submit to the Court, that Mr. Paine and Mr. Rickman being both of them members of the Constitutional Society, what one writes for publication, and the other publishes, is evidence after what has been already stated. 
EYRE 2970 I cannot myself, imagine that those facts, which are so perfectly distinct from the particular subject of this indictment, can possibly implicate them so as to make theip publications evidence in this cause. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2971 Then we will make it evidence in a moment, because I shall now i to your lordships a resolution in the ook of the society, for printing part of this in the Argus, and then I shall read that part which is printed in the Argus. 
EYRE 2972 You might read the whole, and then prove a resolution of the society for printing a part, because that proves them cognizant of it, having selected a part, 
ERSKINE 2973 I may show a knowledge, but does not show an aprrobetiant 
EYRE 2974 Certainly not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2975 I will not trouble your lordship with this any farther.

EYRE 3258 What length were the handles 
MR_RICKMAN 3259 I believe some were about seven feet. 
EYRE 3260 What length were the blades 
MR_RICKMAN 3261 About ten inches. 
EYRE 3262 What shape were the blades
MR_RICKMAN 3263 About the same shape as a bayonet. 
EYRE 3264 you mean they were fluted like a bayonet 
MR_RICKMAN 3265 Yes. 
JURYMEMBER 3266 And pointed 
MR_RICKMAN 3267 Yes. 
JURYMEMBER 3268 Juryman.—In the form and shape of a bg ho 
MR_RICKMAN 3269 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3270 Were there any of any other shape 
MR_RICKMAN 3271 No, none that were made —none that were shafted. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3272 Were there any made that were not shafted, of any other shape 
MR_RICKMAN 3273 There was one that was made before, that was not of that shape. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3274 “ Was that one that was not of that shape ever shown to Yorke
MR_RICKMAN 3275 Yes, I believe it was the one that Hill took up to Mr. Yorke 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3276 You saw that one
MR_RICKMAN 3277  Yes, I have seen it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3278 Those that were actually shafted were in the shape of a bayonet 
MR_RICKMAN 3279 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3280 And the handle seven feet long, and the blade about ten inches 
MR_RICKMAN 3281 I think so. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3282 What wood were the handles made of
MR_RICKMAN 3283 I Believe of fir. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3284 Was there any particular reason given why the handles were made of fir
MR_RICKMAN 3285 Not that I know of. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3286 You see there is a reason in the letter read just now 
MR_RICKMAN 3287  Yes. 
ERSKINE 3288 This examination is not regee this is Mr. Law’s evidence—but I 
ERSKINE 3289 not care about it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3290 Has Davison been long at Sheffield 
MR_RICKMAN 3291 No. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3292 Do you know where he is now
MR_RICKMAN 3293  No. 1 have never heard of him since I was taken up. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3294 Had he left Sheffeld at that time
MR_RICKMAN 3295 Yes, he had left it about a furtnight before I was taken up. Had Gale left it?—Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3296 How long before you were taken upi— Nearl about the same time, I believe. Did you ever hear of such a thing as a cat
MR_RICKMAN 3297 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3298 What is that? what is the other nanre of it
MR_RICKMAN 3299 A night-cat, I believe. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3300 What is a night-cat 
MR_RICKMAN 3301 It stands four ways, about this shape (describing it.) 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3302 Have you seen one
MR_RICKMAN 3303 I have seen the model of one. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3304 When 
MR_RICKMAN 3305 I cannot recollect; about five or six weeks before I was taken oP 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3306 Had you ever seen such a thing before? No, never. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3307 What is the use of a night-cat
MR_RICKMAN 3308 The use of a T understood, was for acting against the cavalry. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3309 Why, how was a night-cat to act against cavalry
MR_RICKMAN 3310 I cannot tell.—I have mentioned all I can tell about it.—I never saw a thing of that sort before; that is all I know about it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3311 You, a Sheffield man, must know how such a thing as that could hurta horse 
MR_RICKMAN 3312 By throwing it m the streets. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3313 ould it run into his neck, or what other part 
MR_RICKMAN 3314 Into his foot, I should suppose. 
ERSKINE 3315  You were asked this question by the counset for the crown, From what passed amengst the members, what was the professed object of this society? To which you answered, a par liamentary reform
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3316 Yes. 
ERSKINE 3317 Was that your object when you became a member of that society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3318 Yes. 
ERSKINE 3319 ee say you were secretary to that society
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3320 Yes. 
ERSKINE 3321 From the year 1791, to 1793 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3322 Yes. 
ERSKINE 3323 Will you explain to the gentlemen of the jury, when you became a member of this society, in order to obtain a parliamertary reform: You were asked, what z among the different members? What was their object? What sort of parliamentary reform was it, that you fairly, as a man, meant 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3324 A more equal representation of the people. 
ERSKINE 3325 A more equal representation of the people, where 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3326 In parliament. 
ERSKINE 3327 In what branch of parliament
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3328 In the House of Commons. 
ERSKINE 3329 Had you any idea by a parliamentary reform, in your own inind, when you ea member, or when you continued’ there, to touch the king’s majesty, or the House of Lords
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3330 No, never.—I never had that idea. 
ERSKINE 3331 Never in your life 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3332 No. 
ERSKINE 3333 Task you in the presence of God, to whom you will answer, hall you any idea of destroyin ihe king, or the House of Lords
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3334 No, God forbid. 
ERSKINE 3335 Had you ever, in the whole course of your being a member of that society, and a secretary, from any proceedings of the assembly, from what passed among the members, from what they said and did a follow the question which the counsel correctly put) ; had you apy reason to think that any of them meant differently from yourself
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3336 No, never—not an hiss amongst the whole society. 
ERSKINE 3337 Then F understand you to say, upon the oath you have taken, and subject to the consequences here and hereafter, that there was no such idea either in your own wind, or from what you knew from others, what they said and what they did, in the mind of any other of the members 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3338 Never. 
ERSKINE 3339 When you said that the resolve was not to petition parliament, did you mean not to petition it at that time, or never to petition it, when the sentiments of the people at large could be known 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3340 I cannot dpesk to that— There was no specific plan ever pointed out, by what-means redress should be obtained. 
ERSKINE 3341 Was it ever pointed out, or from any thing which passed in your presence during all your attendance, that this change in the representation of the people in the House of Commons was to be carried by force of arms and violence 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3342 No, never. 
ERSKINE 3343 If you had had an idea that the members of your society, or of other societies in the different parts of the kingdom, meant by combining force to over-rule the inclinations of the people at large, and the inclinations of the arliament, would you have continued a memer of it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3344 No, I would not. Task you, under the solemnity of the oath which you are under, to say, whether you ever heard any thing said, or saw any thing done, that led you to believe, or to suspect, that that was the intention of your society ?—No, never. 
ERSKINE 3345 Didyou eyer hear any thing said, or see any thing done, which led you to suspect, that it was the intention, even of any mischievous individuals among you
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3346 No; I never suspected it; I never cause to suspect any one. 
ERSKINE 3347 If you had had an idea, independently of force, that the object you were about might ultimately have affected the safety and honour of your sovereign upon the throne, would you have continued in that society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3348 No; I would not. 
ERSKINE 3349 You say you continued secretary ull the year 1793.—Did you read with attention, all that you signed
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3350 or did you take it on trust, from the opinion you entertained of the general objects of the society, that it was all as it ought to be?—I generally read it before I signed it, I do not know that Lever signed a letter till I had read it. 
ERSKINE 3351 Did you continue to be a member after you ceased to be secretary
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3352 I did. , 
ERSKINE 3353 Did you continue to be a member up to the time when you were taken up 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3354 I did. 
ERSKINE 3355 Did you see any reason, before the time you were taken up, tu change your sentiments concerning the opinions of those with whom you associated 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3356 I did not. 
ERSKINE 3357 Have you had any reason to believe,—I ask you to look in upon your own soul, when you answer the question, that, though they might not intend mischief originally when associated, they began to intend mischief
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3358 No: I never did. 
ERSKINE 3359 When was it that your meetings began to be threatened with joterruption
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3360 It was about the month of April, I fancy ; as near as i can guess, the beginning of April or March,1794. 
ERSKINE 3361 Do you remember the time when-the convention was to meet in Edinburgh 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3362 Yes. 
ERSKINE 3363 Was there any thing proposed by the society of which you were a member, or did yqu ever hear any thing said, or see any thing done to the effect, that this convention was to put down the king, and the upper House, and to be itself the king and the parlisment 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3364 Never. 
ERSKINE 3365 Did it ever enter into your conception, that this convention was to make laws for the public, or perform the functions of any part of the state
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3366 No, I never understood it so. 
ERSKINE 3367 ‘Was it then to consider, what would be the best means in a legal manner to effect a change in the representation of the people in the House of Commons 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3368 By petitioning parliament, at the meeting of the Scotch Convention; that was the idea that the Sheffield Society had at that time. 
ERSKINE 3369 Whether it was not universally said, among your society (I am following Mr. Law's question) that, though a petition from a small number ofindividusls would be neglected, and therefore you laid aside petitioning, whether it was not the general declarations,—I am not speaking of men’s secret ideas, but as far as they were manifested,—that when you had got the sentiments of a great number of a respectable part of the people, and were then to petition, at a convention, that the House of Commons would attcnd to your petition, though they would not attend to a petition from a small body of men 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3370 Yes. 
ERSKINE 3371 Was that your idea
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3372 At that time it was. 
ERSKINE 3373 Was that, upon your oath, what you collected to be the gencral sentiments of the peeple 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3374 Yes, it was; and my own ideas. 
ERSKINE 3375 Were you, while you continued a member of the society, and up to the time that you were taken up, really a friend to the British constitution, in its purity 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3376 Yes, I was. 
ERSKINE 3377 Had you any wish to bring into England, the desolations and the’anarchies that are in France 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3378 No, never. 
ERSKINE 3379 Had you a wish to see the king put down from his throne, we will not even talk of his death, but had you a wish to see the king, and the royal family, put down from their state and dignity
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3380 No; God forbid that I should ever live to see it. 
ERSKINE 3381 Should not you have Saxahe yourself the most wicked and abandoned of mankind, if you had remained an hour in that society, if you had thought that the wish of that society
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3382 Yes; I should bave thought so. 
ERSKINE 3383 Did you, from what you saw, or from what you beard, syspect that to be behind the curtain, and the intentions of those people, though they expressed themselves differently? 
GARROW 3384 I must beg to object to that question; it is for the jury, what this may i suspected was behind the curtain, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3385 I certainty will not object to it.I desire to be understood, that I, by ao means, agree that it is a question that could he put, unless I consented to it. 
ERSKINE 3386 And I am much more “pleased to’ accept it, upon the attorney general's declaration now, than tu argue the “point, whatever might be my own opinion concerning it—Then, fron what you ob‘served, saw, and heurd, had you any reason to believe then, or do you now believe, that, though the papers that were signed carried “upon the faces of them parliamentary reform, as you have expresged it, that there was an intention, in point of fact, to destroy the constitution of Great Britain
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3387 No; I never had reason, in my life, to believe any such thing. 
ERSKINE 3388 You say, for the first time, you began to be interrupted in your proceedings, in 1793 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3389 Yes. 
ERSKINE 3390 What were the nature of the threats you 
ERSKINE 3391 “received, and what were you afraid of?’—We “were afraid of the opposite party making an attack upon us in our meetings, or out of doors. 
ERSKINE 3392 What do you mean by the opposite party? the king and parliament? or the eople of Sheffield, of a different opinion The people in Sheffield, of a different opinion. 
ERSKINE 3393 You were afraid of the opposite party, of the people who thought differently from you, that they intended to persecute you
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3394 Yes. 
ERSKINE 3395 Did you believe, at the time you were threatened to be interrupted, that you were doing what was legal? — Yes; we beews we were duing every thing that was legal. 
ERSKINE 3396 Did you, for one, believe you were doin what was legal 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3397 Yes ; I did not know that was committing any thing that was wrong. I never heard that any thing was not right. 
ERSKINE 3398 What was the nature of the apprehension that you had, at the time that Mr. Yorke Proposed your having arms to defend yourselves
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3399 The opinion I had was, that the people, if they meant to attack us, would do better to arm themselves. 
ERSKINE 3400 What people 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3401 The opposite party to us in Sheffield. 
ERSKINE 3402 Had you any other intention, or from all that you heard in your society, from Mr. Yorke himself, or any body in your society, that any other use was intended to be made 
ERSKINE 3403 ‘of these three dozen of pikes, or any thing else you had, but merely to defend yourselves
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3404 Nothing else. 
ERSKINE 3405 Do you believe, from any thing you heard or saw, that it was in the contemplation of any body to employ these pikes, or any other arms, against the king and the parliament 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3406  ‘No; never. 
ERSKINE 3407 Would you have remained an hour in that society, if you had any reason to see, that that was the use intended to be made of those arms 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3408 No, I would not. " Pid you believe—I am not asking you the law, for you cannot be supposed to know any thing of the law—Did you believe that you had a right to arms for your defence, under the law of your country?—I did believeIhad ad. 
ERSKINE 3409 Under what law 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3410 By the Bill of Rights. 
ERSKINE 3411 Was that the manner in which the right to have these arms was debated in your society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3412 I do not remember any debate. 
ERSKINE 3413 But was any thing said about your right to have arms, if you were attacked by malicious people
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3414 We thought we had a right to detend ourselves, founded upon the Bill of Rights, against any of those people that might attack us. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3415 Who told you that you had that right
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3416 I have heard Mr. Yorke say so. 
ERSKINE 3417 Was it ever debated amongst you, that if you were commanded by the whole authority of the state, that you were to raise arms amongst the people to support the authority of your convention as 3 parliament
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3418 No; I never heard that debated. 
ERSKINE 3419 Was there ever any hint that the laws were to be made by those twenty or thirty people at Edinburgh
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3420 No; I never heard any such thing. 
ERSKINE 3421 What did you consider these people at Edinburgh were to do, who were a convention from these different societies 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3422 I cannot speak to what their business was when met together, 
ERSKINE 3423 Were they to consider what were the best means to go on, in a legal and peaceable manner, to obtain a parliamentary reform 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3424 I supposed so; I understood it so. 
ERSKINE 3425 Did you know Mr. Hardy 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3426 I never did. 
ERSKINE 3427 Did you really think, that you were com tending for rights that rendered more secure, and more permanent, the king's title
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3428 I did; I always looked upon it as such. 
ERSKINE 3429 Do you recollect why that particu species of arms was rccommended, or apy thing said about these pikes
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3430 I believe it was the cheapness of the article. 
ERSKINE 3431 You saw a model of this cat —Yes. 
ERSKINE 3432 Were you an inhabitant of Sheffield at that time 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3433 Yes. 
ERSKINE 3434 Did’ you ever see such a thing, or know that there was any one made fromm that model 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3435 No; I never did. 
ERSKINE 3436 Did you ever see such a one in the kingdom or Great Britain 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3437 The person I gotit of said he had seen such things, many years before, at Newcastle. 
ERSKINE 3438 But you never saw, nor none of your socicty, to your knowledge, ever saw any instrument ‘made after this model
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3439 No; Not that I'know of. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3440 You say this man told you he had seed some of these night-cats at Newcastle
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3441  Yes. Did he tell you at what time, in the history of his life, he had seen them there ?—It wasduring his life time. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3442 Was it at any particular period of the history of the country, did he tell you
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3443 No; he did not mention the year he had seen them in. You know what I inean perfectly well.— Did he tell you what was going on in the country, at the time he saw them at Newcastle?—I do not recollect that he did.—I think he said it was some time about the American war; about the close of it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3444 You say you expected opposition from the other party, at Sheftield
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3445 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3446 How came you and Davison to send a letter about sending pikes to London, in order to oppose the other party at Shetheld 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3447 I t was Davison sent the letter. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3448 So Davison sent a letter to London about pikes, you thinking they were to oppose the other party at Sheffield 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3449 He might have the same views in it for the people of London, as for the people at Sheftield. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3450 You have talked about cavalry: what were the opposite party at Sheffield, who were to attack you with cavalry 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3451 I do not know. Why what cavalry was this night-cat for?—It was only a model of one; I never saw any made; it was never to be put in executon. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3452 How came you to talk about cavalry
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3453 It was when he was talking about the use of it, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3454 Your opinion was about the opposite party at Sheffield, and Davison’s opinion, of course, about the opposite party in London 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3455 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3456 That is what he calls the bare-faced aristocracy of the present administration 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3457 He called it so. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3458 What did you understand by that, when he showed you this letter, before he sent it to London, about the pikes, upon your oath 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3459 I only, upon my oath, understood that he Meant the opposite party. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3460 Why this Davison, who meant as little as you did, was not so bold as you, for he ran mney a fortnight before you were taken up
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3461 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3462 How came he to do that
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3463 I believe he of some persons being in Sheffield; that was the report. And so he thought so little about this innocent thing of the opposite party, that he Tan away ?—I cannot give any other reason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3464 You told us that the cheapness of the article was the reason why you thought of pikes
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3465 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3466 How much was the handle and the blade to cost 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3467 Twenty- pence, I believe. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3468 So that thirteen-pence would not pay for them
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3469 The hoop and the blade would come to that by themselves. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3470 If the blade and the hoop had come to London, at the price of one shilling, there Would be some more expence to pay, that somebody else must provide for
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3471 Yes; there would be the shaft to it. ders 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3472 ‘Did you ever hear of such a place as the Parrot, in Green Arbour Alley, London 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3473 No; I did not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3474 Never 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3475 No; I never did. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3476 Had you any conversation with Davison about these pikes, after he showed you this letter
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3477 I do not recollect that I had any conversation with him at the time. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3478 But after
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3479 No; not that I can bring to my recollection what it was. 
GARROW 3480 You reside at Sheffield, I believe
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3481 Yes. 
GARROW 3482 What are you by business 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3483 A cutler. 
GARROW 3484 Were you a member of any society at Sheffield, which had the name of the Constie tutional Society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3485 Yes. 
GARROW 3486 At what time did you become a member of it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3487 At the first institution of the society, I think in the year 1791, when the society was first instituted. 
GARROW 3488 Were you one of twelve of that society which were afterwards associated with the Constitutional Society of London 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3489 I was not then a member of any committee, nor did 1 act in any public character. 
GARROW 3490 That is not the question that I put to you ; I ask, whether at any time you became an associated member of a society in London, called the Constitutional Society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3491 I never was a member of the Constitutional Society it London. 
GARROW 3492 I did not ask you whether you were of not, but whether you were one of the twelve of the Sheffield Society who were associated with the Constitutional Society in London
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3493 We were above twelve when that society was wrote to, and therefore I do not understand the question. 
GARROW 3494 I will explain the question to you: your society at Sheffield were more numerous than twelve
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3495 Yes. 
GARROW 3496 And when you were more numerous than twelve, the Constitutional Society in London were written to by your society—do you agree so far with me
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3497 Yes. 
GARROW 3498 Did your society, when you wrote to the other society, port any names of persons to be associated with the society in London
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3499 I never heard that subject spoken of, nor any letter to that purpose. 
GARROW 3500 bia you know whether you, or any other persons of the Sheffield Society, were received as associated members of the Constitutional Society in London
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3501 I do not recollect an such persons being constituted a member the Constitutional Society in London; I do not recollect; I have no knowledge of any such matter. 
GARROW 3502 Do I understand you right, that you do recollect such a prepeson moving from your society to the London Society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3503 Letters were wrote from one society to the other. 
GARROW 3504 Proposing such a measure
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3505 I understood that they acted in conjunction; I always un00d it as such, 
GARROW 3506 Did I understand you right, that one of the modes by which that acting in conjunction was to be brought about, was, that a certain number of your society should be associated with the London Constitutional Society, for the purposes of general conjunctive acting 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3507 I do not know that any such subject was ever settled; I know no farther of the junction of the society but what passed by letter. 
GARROW 3508 Did you at any time act as a secretary to the society at Shetlield
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3509 Yes, about five months. 
GARROW 3510 Was that the five months last before you were apprehended 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3511 Yes. 
GARROW 3512 When were you apprehended 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3513 I think in May last. 
GARROW 3514 Be so good as tell us for what purpose your Constitutional Society were assembled, and what the professed object of their assembling was 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3515 The object was a parliamentary reform. 
GARROW 3516 By what means was that reform fo be effected 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3517 By meeting and endeavouring to enlighten each other, and spread the knowledge both of the grievances which we considered to exist, or which were frequently wrote of and spoken of, and informing the ; 
GARROW 3518 people of the necessity of a reform, that they might unitedly move for it in the best and most unexceptionable mode. 
GARROW 3519 Was there any peculiar mode by which the election of meant to the House of Commons was to be effected, according to your proposition as to the right of voting
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3520 That subject was never discussed to my knowledge. 
GARROW 3521 Are you acquainted with the expression— universal suffrage 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3522 I expect I am. 
GARROW 3523 Was it or not the scheme of the Constitutional Society at Sheffield, that a reform was to be produced by universal sutfrage
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3524 It never was, as far as my recollection of it; it never was until the Edinburgh Convention ; I nae heard of universal suffrage until that ime. 
GARROW 3525 Was the circumstance of the Edinburgh Convention known to the Constitutional Society at Sheffield —They sent a delegate, and therefore certainly they must know it. 
GARROW 3526 Who was their delegate at the convention at Edinburgh 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3527 Matthew Campbell Brown ; but Iwas not secretary at that time; they called upon me to take upon me the secretaryship just after he was gone to Edinburgh. 
GARROW 3528 Do you know a person of the name of. Veucy Yorke
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3529 I know a person who goes by that name. 
GARROW 3530 Perhaps you know him by another name
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3531 I have heard another name. 
GARROW 3532 What is it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3533 Henry Redhead. 
GARROW 3534 And who likewise goes by the name. of Yorke 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3535 Yes. 
GARROW 3536 Did Yorke or Redhead ever reside at Shefficld 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3537 Several times he has been at Sheffield. 
GARROW 3538 Did he reside there for any time 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3539 This last time I do not exactly know how long; may be six weeks, or seven or eight weeks. 
GARROW 3540 Do you know a person of the name of Gale, a printer at Shefficld
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3541 Very well, 
GARROW 3542 Mr. Yorke was not a settled inhabitant of Sheffield, was he 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3543 No. 
GARROW 3544 Did he attend the meetings of the Constitutional Society at Sheffield
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3545 He attended almost every weekly meeting during his last visit to Shetheld. 
GARROW 3546 As he was not a settled inhabitant of Shef-field, in what character did Mr. Yorke, during his last visit, attend regularly the weekly Meetings of the society !—They, considering him as a man of considerable abilities, and as an orator, paid great respect to him, and he used to attend constantly onee a week at the meeting which was called the committce ; but jt was not properly acommittee, for the time of the expiration of the committee which was before, was clapsed, and another was not chose, and such persons who had been on the committee were admitted principally on ac count of Mr. Yorke being at Shefheld. 
GARROW 3547 You have given me a guod reason why he should be treated with respect when he was there; that he was a man of talents and an orator; but I ask in what character he came there 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3548 I am totally unacquainted with tbat, for he did not bring any letter to us; I have heard say Did you ever hear him himself say ?—No;never hadany conversation with him uponit 
GARROW 3549 You never heard from himself then in what character he came there 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3550 No. 
GARROW 3551 But being there, you discovered be had great talents, and was an orator 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3552 Yes. 
GARROW 3553 Did he take any part in the management of the business of the society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3554 He wrote several pamphlets while at Sheffield, and at several times brought some part, if not the whole of these pamphlets, in manuscript, ta these meetings to be read. 
GARROW 3555 Do you speak now of the weekly mectings, which were improperly called committees
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3556 Yes. 
GARROW 3557 Where were these mectings held 2—At my house. 
GARROW 3558 You had a commodious room there probably 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3559 It was a small room where these mectings met, but there was a large room when a great number met. 
GARROW 3560 The meeting was improperly called a committee, when they met in a small room 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3561 Yes. 
GARROW 3562 How often was the other room used
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3563 Some two, three, or four times; I do not recollect how many during bis last visit. 
GARROW 3564 Was there in that room any preparation for the more commodious exercise of the talents of oratory of Mr. Yorke
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3565 Yes. 
GARROW 3566 What 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3567 A little matter erected to elevate the speaker. 
GARROW 3568 What was that called, that we may have 3 name to put down in our notes
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3569 Some called it one thing, some called it another, 
GARROW 3570 What did you call it, for instance
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3571 I never called it any-thing. 
GARROW 3572 What was the more general name for it ip the society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3573 Some called it the pulpit, some the tribune, but it never was christened.' But it was a commadious elevation for the orator, and some called it a pulpit, others a tribune ?—Yes. 
GARROW 3574 And from this tribune Mr. Yorke addressed the society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3575 He did. 
GARROW 3576 Besides those meetings, improperly called committees, and those meetings in which the tribune was, do you remember any meeting upon the Castle-hill
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3577 Very well. 
GARROW 3578 Was that of the date of the 7th of April 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3579 I do not justly recollect the day, but I was there. 
GARROW 3580 Was Mr. Yorke there 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3581 Yes. 
GARROW 3582 Did he there exercise himself in addressing the people 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3583 Yes. 
GARROW 3584 In what sort of manner and Janguage 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3585 He had a book in his hand wrote by Locke, and he expatiated very largely on the corruption that had crept into the English constitution, or rather the evils which generally are complained of, and showed there was a deviation, in some degree, from the original constitution of Great-Britain; but his manner of speaking may sometimes lead him to go farther than he ought. 
GARROW 3586 Did that unfortunate fatality upon this occasion occur, that he did go farther than in your judgment he ought
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3587 It was agreed upon that I should make a motion. 
GARROW 3588 First answer my question ; did it appear to you that his address that had Locke’s book for its text, was more violent, and went farther than it ought 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3589 He is peculiarly energetic, and at the same time very fiery, very warm, very strong; but at this meeting I do not know that he said any thing that was detrimental to the constitutional law of EngJand—not at this meeting. 
GARROW 3590 It was settled, you said, that you were todo something—settled by whom
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3591 By Mr. Yorke and Mr. Gale, at a meeting previous. 
GARROW 3592 At one of the committees 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3593 Yes; that I should make a motion for a petition to the House of Commons, for a reform in the representation of the people. 
GARROW 3594 For what purpose were you to make that motion as it was settled 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3595 That it might be over-ruled. 
GARROW 3596 Was it settled at the committee before-hand then, that a motion should be made that it might be over-ruled 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3597 Yes, it was so agreed upon, and further for the purpose of introducing sunther: motion in its place. 
GARROW 3598 id you make the motion as it had been agreed 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3599 I did, for petitioning the House of Commons. 
GARROW 3600 What was done upon your making that motion
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3601 It was objected to with a view of making way for another, which was brought in and carried. 
GARROW 3602 Whom was it objected to by; who was the atiecior 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3603 There were only four of us, the other member I do not at present recollect: it was either Henry Yorke, Joseph Gale, or William Camage. 
GARROW 3604 “You mean there were only four of the committee that attended
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3605 lIn the elevation 
GARROW 3606 There was an elevation then upon the Castle-hill
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3607 Yes, one of those things we called the tribune was carried upon the Castle-hill. 
GARROW 3608 Then one of these persons opposed your motion 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3609 Yes. 
GARROW 3610 What number of persons might there be assembled at this meeting 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3611 Several thousands. , 
GARROW 3612 A meeting in the open air 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3613 Yes. 
GARROW 3614 And then one of these persons opposed your motion, as it had been agreed, for the introduction of another 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3615 Yes. 
GARROW 3616 What was the substance of that other motion
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3617 Instead of petitioning the House of Commons to petition his majesty, and a petition was drawn up ; the parchments lay at my house. — — 
GARROW 3618 Drawn up by whom 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3619  enry Yorke or Redhead. Pe a “J 
GARROW 3620 Was it before or after the meeting in the open air, that it was drawn up
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3621 Perhaps it’ might be drawn up before, and read there: I think it was, but it was not signed till after. 
GARROW 3622 Then it was left at your house for signa.’ tures 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3623 It was. 
GARROW 3624 Upon the occasion of the introducing this amendment upon your proposition, did Mr. Yorke address the meeting, composed, as you say, of some thousands 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3625 Yes, he addressed’ them: he introduced that subject of petition ing the king to exercise his power for a reform in the representation of the people, and this petition was sent up to London to earl Stanhope, but he did not think proper to present it in that form. 
GARROW 3626 Do you remember a day or two after the ineeting upon the Castle-hill, being in company with Gale and Yorke at your house,’ when any application was made to Yorke upon the subject of the speech he had delivered to the people upon the Castle-hill; do you re-' member any application to him a day or two afterwards, upon the subject of printing his’ speech
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3627 I remember something being said to him upon it at my house. 
GARROW 3628 Did he agrce to print his speech
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3629 To the best of my recollection, he did. 
GARROW 3630 Was it printed 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3631 It was. 
GARROW 3632 Did you see it afterwards in print 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3633 Yes. 
GARROW 3634 From having heard it upon the Castle-hill, could you form an opinion, whether the printed copy which you saw afterwards, was a pretty accurate statement of what passed 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3635 The substance of the matter he delivered there, I believe it contains. 
GARROW 3636 Was that publistied at Sheffield
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3637 Yes. 
GARROW 3638 Do you believe this to be one of those publicationsIshowing it to the witness]
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3639 I do. 
GARROW 3640 Did you receive afterwards from Yorke, any number of these pamphlets for any purpose
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3641 I did not receive them from Yorke, but I received them at Gale’s shop. 
GARROW 3642 Did you do any thing with them by the direction of Yorke 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3643 It was by the direction of : the meeting, previous to their being commu, nicated to different persons. 
GARROW 3644 Do you mean the general meeting, or the private meeting 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3645 The private meeting directed they should be communicated to different persons. 
GARROW 3646 Did you, in consequence, make up any packets of them, and do you believe these to be two of the packets [showing them to the witness]
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3647 They are: they are directed to me according to order. 
GARROW 3648 How many might you direct in that manner in separate packages
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3649 I do not recollect exactly, there might be twenty-four, or more. 
GARROW 3650 What was done with these, after you had made them up separately, and addressed them to the different persons 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3651 They were lapped up and directed to certain persons, and then ut together in a box. 
GARROW 3652 to whom were they sent!—To the best of my recollection they were sent to Thomas dy. 
GARROW 3653 What was your situation in life before you were applied to to become the secretary of this society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3654 I was a cutler. 
GARROW 3655 Were you working at your business
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3656 Yes, when I had any business to work at. 
GARROW 3657 Were you applied to to become the secretary, or did you apply for it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3658 I was applied to 
GARROW 3659 By whom 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3660 By one of the members, John Alcock. Were you paid anything for your trouble ?—Yes. 
GARROW 3661 What was your inducement to take that office upon you
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3662 I should not have taken it upon me, if I had not been applied to. 
GARROW 3663 What induced you to do it?7—The war destroyed my business. 
GARROW 3664 Am J to understand that you did it to increase your means of support ‘—I did. 
GARROW 3665 Did it come to your knowledge, in your character as a member of the society, or atherwise, that there were any preparations of arms of any sort at Sheffield 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3666 I heard reports as other peuple might do, but purposely avoided meddling, in thought or act, with any matter of that sort. 
GARROW 3667 Did you in the society, or from the members of the society, bear of any proposition for: 
GARROW 3668 providing arms, or that any were 1n preparation 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3669 I did, and it is proper that this should be well explained. 
GARROW 3670 Eapisis that
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3671 A few days before this meeting, when it was spoken to as being the right of Baglshmen to have in their power means of defence, a hand-bill, a spurious hand-bill was published in Sheffield, with an intention to provoke the society to some unjustifiable measures, and it was spoke to in the meeting, that it was their right to have them in their own defence, and Joseph Gale spoke to it; he was the man. This wicked hand-bill was not signed by any magistrate; it was throwed about the town in the dark; it caused an agitation in the minds of the people, and it was ke of as being the right of every individual shee, to have such and such arms accordin; to their rights, lest any tumult or riot should break out. I am happy to speak of this, and 
GARROW 3672 T should be happy to see that advertisement, with what was said at this meeting, which ioe published in the Sheffield paper the week after. 
GARROW 3673 Was this hand-bill distributed previous to the meeting upon the Castle-hill
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3674 To the best of my recollection it was after that meeting. 
GARROW 3675 Was the subject of procuring arms publicly discussed or in the private meetings of the society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3676 It was at a public meeting Mr. Gale spoke of our rights. 
GARROW 3677 A meeting in your large room 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3678 Yes. 
GARROW 3679 A public meeting of the society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3680 Yes. 
GARROW 3681 By the society only
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3682 There were manv others that were not members there, as well as others. 
GARROW 3683 How did they come? were they introduced by memhers
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3684 The tickets were not regularly delivered, I believe, at that time. 
GARROW 3685 Then members introduced visitors 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3686 Yes. 
GARROW 3687 Did you see any arms, or any model of any 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3688 I never saw a pike ull I saw one when I was brought to London. 
GARROW 3689 Whatsort of arms were they that were talked of, as fit to be had for the pugposes stated
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3690 Pikes were talked of, but r mever saw one tillI was brought to London, 
GARROW 3691 I do not know whether you heard any thing of the night-cats 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3692 I saw a model of one, but it was only like the play-thing of a child. 
GARROW 3693 Now we will have an account of the manner in which children play at Sheffield, what sort of an instrument was it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3694 A little instrument standing up with a point about one inch high. 
JURYMEMBER 3695 It was in a ball was it not
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3696 No. 
GARROW 3697 Ithad four cross points? 
GARROW 3698 Juryman.—Were there only four of these
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3699 I think there were four. 
GARROW 3700 So that if you threw it down it always presented a point
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3701 That did. 
GARROW 3702 How long is that point
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3703 This was about three quarters of an inch. 
GARROW 3704 Only made just to show what the sort of thing was
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3705 Yes. 
GARROW 3706 Was there any other purpose for which these instruments were spoken of in the so ciety to be made, except playing with them as children 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3707 Never any mention made of them in the society at all. 
GARROW 3708 Where did you see the model 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3709 At the house of one Benjamin Dunn. 
GARROW 3710 Was he a member of the society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3711 Yes, but it was not he that produced it. 
GARROW 3712 Who produced it at his house 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3713 I think they call him Charles Rhodes. — 
GARROW 3714 Had you ever seen such a thing before
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3715 I never did. 
GARROW 3716 You neturally were led to ask its use and the purpose for which it was to be constructed, What was stated to be the purpose of this play thing
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3717 I do not recollect any conversi tion upon that head, but it was taken thrown upon the floor. 
GARROW 3718 Was that act of throwing it on the floor, and of course its presenting one of its points a companied by no description of the use it might be applied to, besides playing with it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3719 What might be said that night might not be serious. 
GARROW 3720 When talking of a play thing one is not serious; now, serious or not, what was said of it 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3721 Nothing was said, but he brought it to’ show them. 
GARROW 3722 What was said, serious or not serious, as to the use to which that might or could or was intended to be applied
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3723 I cannot call to mind any thing that was said, but this only, that he came to show them that such a little boy, whose name he mentioned, had made it, and showed it them. 
GARROW 3724 Was it called by any name
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3725 I heard no name of it till I came to London, there it was called a Cat. 
GARROW 3726 A night Cat, or day Cat, or any thing of that kind 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3727 I heard no name whatever. 
GARROW 3728 Was there any conversation at that time when it was thrown upon the floor about Cavalry 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3729 I do not recollect any conversation eal but merely the throwing it upon the oor. 
GARROW 3730 You said just now that the conversation, such as it was, might not be serious
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3731 No, laughing at it. pon your oath was there any conversation Serious or not with respect to Cavalry or the town of Newcastle?—Newcastle was not mentioned there, it was not at the same place I apprehend. 
GARROW 3732 Where was it that there was conversation about the town of Newcastle 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3733 I know nothing about any conversation about Newcastle. 
GARROW 3734 Upon your oath were you never present when that model was produced, and when there was a conversation about Newcastle 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3735 Upon my oath I never was. 
GARROW 3736 Then you never heard any conversation at Sheffield about this night-cat or this model of a night-cat with respect to cavalry 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3737 I do not recoilect any conversation about its use but a mere trifling, desultory, pleasing, irregular conversation with one another. 
GARROW 3738 Now that trifling, pleasing, desultory, irregular conversation I want to have—I am sure I cannot reccllect it; if I could recollect it I would. 
GARROW 3739 ‘Try, do not hurry yourself —I cannot recollect any thing that was said, only his taking it out of his pocket, showing it us, and throwing it on the floor; there was no regular conversation, no debate whatever about it. 
GARROW 3740 And the nature of the desultory observations that were made you do not recollect 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3741 He showed it to the company as being the production of a boy, a child, I remember that perfectly well. 
GARROW 3742 Et was a thing that you had never seen any thing like before 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3743 I believe I never had. 
GARROW 3744 You contented yourself with seeing it thrown down, and looking at one of its points
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3745 I had nothing to do with it whatever. 
GARROW 3746 You tokl me that at the meetings at the Castle-hill, Mr. Yorke, though in general warm and energetic, and disposed to say strong things, did not say any hing that was detrimental to the cunstitutional law of England, were you present at any other meeting where his speeches were not quite of that character 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3747 I have been present at other meetings when he has not been so well guarded as he was at that meeting. 
GARROW 3748 Perhaps those might be meetings of the society only 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3749 So called, of the society only. 
GARROW 3750 But with visitors admitted, be so good as tell us the tendency of his discourses when he rather gave himself liberty, when he followed the impulse of his nature? —If I had noted them down, I might have been able to have repeated them. 
GARROW 3751 I do not expect you should give us them in his manner or precise words, but give us the substance and effect of those expressions which appeared to you to be unguarded 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3752 I do not justly recollect at present. 
GARROW 3753 Endeavour to recollect —I may have heard him when conversing in those meetings, sometimes he was very warm to be sure, and might drop unguarded expressions. 
GARROW 3754 Such as what unguarded expressions 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3755 Comparing what he looked upon to be the grievances under which .we laboured, with the privileges which Englishmen once en
GARROW 3756 Jjoved, he might step out of the way. 
GARROW 3757 What expressions did he use which appeared to you to be unguarded 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3758 I heard him use one expression,—but for my own part I will not presume to puta comment upon it, he expressed himself to this purport, that we were in a low despicable situation, and rather than submit he would go up to London with the people there present. a: 
GARROW 3759 Who were we 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3760 We Englishmen were in such a condition, that rather than subm to it he would go up to London with the people there present, but he did not say for what. 
GARROW 3761 How many were the people present with whom Mr. Yorke was to come up rather than to submit to the degraded state in which the people of England were
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3762 There might be perhaps 150, or perhaps 200. 
GARROW 3763 Was this at one of the meetings of the s0ciety 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3764 With some others. 
GARROW 3765 One of the general meetings 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3766 Yes. 
GARROW 3767 Composed of members of the society and of others
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3768 Yes. 
JURYMEMBER 3769 He would go up with them to London, and what then
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3770 He did not draw any inference. 
GARROW 3771  Was that after you had heard any thing upon the subject of arming
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3772 I think it was before; to the best of my memory it was before that, but Iam not per-fectly clear in that. 
GARROW 3773 Was that delivered from the tribune? Delivered from the place which was sometimes called so, and sometimes called a pulpit. 
GARROW 3774 It was from the orator’s elevation that this speech was delivered 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3775 Yes. 
GARROW 3776 Perhaps having brought that to your memory may enable you to recollect some other accompanying expressions 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3777 I do uot recollect any other that gave me any pain at the time, what was the cause of my remembering that, was the pain I felt at the time. 
GARROW 3778 What was it that occasioned any sensation of pain in you at that declaration of Mr. Yorke
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3779 Why, I fear God and honour the king. 
GARROW 3780 And therefore you felt pain at that declaration of Mr. Yorke
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3781 Yes. 
GARROW 3782 Now, either at that or any other of these meetings, do you recollect any of these expressions of Mr. Yorke—I do not recollect any expressions that so struck me as that. Ido not know whether you have seen this paper before? [showing the witncss a printed paper]—I never saw this, but I saw one from which this was taken. 
GARROW 3783 Have you seen a pamphlet of which you believe that to be one copy 2—Yes. 
GARROW 3784 Look at this [showing the witness another pines pamphlet,“ the fast-day as observed at heffield ] have you seen that before 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3785 I have. 
GARROW 3786 Do you remember the circumstance of a proclamation for a general fast to be held the 8th February, 1794 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3787 Yes. 
GARROW 3788 In what manner was that fast observed upon the Castle-hill at Sheffield 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3789 It was not at the Castle-hill. 
GARROW 3790 Where was it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3791 At the top of the town in another place. 
GARROW 3792 In the open air 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3793 Yes. 
GARROW 3794 Were you there
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3795 I was. 
GARROW 3796 What number of persons do you think might be assembled for the purpose of observing that fast
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3797 Not so many.— 
EYRE 3798  How is that evidence. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3799 Your lordship will recollect that we read a resolution from the books of the Constitutional Society, thanking the people of Sheffield for the manner in which they had spent the fast-day. 
GARROW 3800 With this addition, that the printed paper in my hand was found in the prisoner’s possession. 
BROOMHEAD 3801 I cannot ascertain the number, but there were not so Many as upon the Castle-hill. 
BROOMHEAD 3802 About how many do you think might be assembled
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3803 I cannot tell properly, there might be a thousand or two. 
BROOMHEAD 3804 Tell us the manner in which you, together with that assembly of a thousand or two, celebrated that fast ; is the manner in which it is represented in this printed paper that I showed to you correct
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3805 To the best of my knowledge It is. 
BROOMHEAD 3806 What might the number of your society properly so called amount to
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3807 Nearly 600, more or less. 
BROOMHEAD 3808 Are you divided into divisions
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3809 Such a mode has been advised, but was not regularly kept. 
BROOMHEAD 3810 By whom had that mode been advised 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3811 I do not recullect because that was advised, I believe, before I was a member. 
BROOMHEAD 3812 Do you think that 600 was the full amount of the members of your society at its greatest extent; do you believe it ever amounted to 2,000
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3813 No such thing, because I wrote the tickets down. 
BROOMHEAD 3814 The distribution into divisions or sections was not regularly executed 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3815 No. 
BROOMHEAD 3816 What was done towards that 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3817 There were a kind of books delivered, called district books ; they were not regularly attended to, that is all T can say about it. 
BROOMHEAD 3818 What was the object of the distribution of these district books, where did they issue from 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3819 They were printed by Joseph Gale. 
BROOMHEAD 3820 By whose directions 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3821 They were printed before I joined them. 
BROOMHEAD 3822 Were the society’s books printed by Gale, one of your members a printer at Sheffield
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3823 Yes. 
BROOMHEAD 3824 To what persons were they distributed, and for what purpose 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3825 The members of the society, divined into as we may term them sections, they were called districts. 
BROOMHEAD 3826 What was to be the mode in which these districts of the society, were to assemble’ themselves? — They were to meet if i thought proper, to collect pennies a wee principally, a penny a week from each member. 
BROOMHEAD 3827 Were there any regular periods at which the several sections or divisions were to com municate in one general assembly, or was that left to an emergency 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3828 Such a thing was mentioned, but it never was executed. 
BROOMHEAD 3829 What was mentioned, but not executed 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3830 About these persons meeting to whom the book was delivered, but it was never put in practice. 
BROOMHEAD 3831 So that the district meetings were not so regularly attended to, if 1 understand you, as the general meetings of the society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3832 No, not properly attended to. 
GARROW 3833  Look at these pamphlets (the fast-day as observed at Sheffield, and a serious lecture), where did you find them
LAUZUN 3834 I found bo these in Mr. Hardy’s house. 
GARROW 3835  After the serious lecture was read, there was ahymn prepared I believe 
BROOMHEAD 3836 Yes. 
GARROW 3837 Who prepared that hymn 
BROOMHEAD 3838 Gale printedit
GARROW 3839 Who composed it
BROOMHEAD 3840 I believe it was composed by one Montgomery. 
GARROW 3841 That was sung in full chorus by the whole assembly 
BROOMHEAD 3842 Yes it was sung. 
GARROW 3843 By whose order were these two pamphlets printed and published 
BROOMHEAD 3844 I believe they were printed by Joseph Gale. 
GARROW 3845 By whose order, and at whose expense i— They were sold. 
GARROW 3846 But there is an expense incurred, in print ing and publishing before the sale reimburses
BROOMHEAD 3847 Joseph Gale did not receive any money before the sale. 
GARROW 3848 Who ordered it to be printed 
BROOMHEAD 3849 I believe ! mer, Skirving, Margarot, and Gerrald; also it was a private matter. 
GARROW 3850 Who. furnished the copy to Gale
BROOMHEAD 3851 I do not know for certain. 
GARROW 3852 Who read the lecture
BROOMHEAD 3853 A gentleman from. Halifax. 
GARROW 3854 Do you know of any proceedings of the society, of the committee, or of Yorke, respectig pang and publishing these two pamphlets 
BROOMHEAD 3855 I do not recollect any at present. 
GARROW 3856 Were they in general distributed through the town of Sheffield 
BROOMHEAD 3857 They were sold. 
GARROW 3858 Do you know of your own knowledge whether the sale was extensive or not
BROOMHEAD 3859 I think not very extensive. 
GARROW 3860 There is a prayer, who composed that, do you know 
BROOMHEAD 3861 Myself. 
GARROW 3862 Whom was that delivered by? —By myself. 
GARROW 3863 From notes, or extempore 
BROOMHEAD 3864 It was extempore. 
GARROW 3865 You had written it, and committed it to memory, perhaps 
BROOMHEAD 3866 Yes. 
GARROW 3867 What became of the copy 
BROOMHEAD 3868 lIndeed, I do not know; I took no account of it; it was delivered to be printed. 
GARROW 3869 By whose directions
BROOMHEAD 3870 I do not recollect ; it was at a private meeting that that was spoken of. 
GARROW 3871 A private meeting of what 
BROOMHEAD 3872 Several members of the society. 
GARROW 3873 Tell me, if you know their names, John Paine, of Newhill
BROOMHEAD 3874 I have heard the name, but I do not know the person. 
GARROW 3875 Was hea member of the society 
BROOMHEAD 3876 I believe he might be. 
GARROW 3877 It is in evidence, that he was one of those sent up by their secretary to the London society. 
GARROW 3878 You know Joseph Gale 
BROOMHEAD 3879 Yes. 
GARROW 3880 He was a member
BROOMHEAD 3881 Yes. 
GARROW 3882 And Joseph Smith 
BROOMHEAD 3883 Yes. 
GARROW 3884 And David Martin 
BROOMHEAD 3885 Yes. 
GARROW 3886 It is not worth while going through the names; they were sent up to the Constitutional Society, to be affiliated with them, which is proof that they were members. 
GARROW 3887 Extracts read from a printed pamphlet, intituled, “ Proceedings of the Public Mecting, held at Sheffield, in the open air, on the 7th of April, 1794 ; and also an “ Address to the British Nation, being an Exposition of the Motives which have determined the Pcople of Sheffield to petition the House of Commons no more on the Subject of Parliamentary Reform. Printed for the Sheffield Constitutional Society. 
GARROW 3888 “ Proceedings of the Public Meeting. 
GARROW 3889 “ In pursuance of a public advertisement, a alge meeting of the Friends of Justice, Lierty, and Humanity, was held, at three o'clock on Monday, the 7th of April, 1794, on the Castle-hill, in Sheffield, to consider upon the propriety of addressing the king, in behalf of the persecuted patriots, citizeas Muir, Palof again petitioning the House of Commons for a reform in the representation of the people, and to determine upon the propriety of peutioning the king, for the total and unquaified abolition of negro slavery. 
GARROW 3890 “ Notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather (very severe rains having fallen until within a quarter of an hour of the appointed time of mecting), from ten‘to twelve thousand people were assembled on the occasion: 
GARROW 3891 “HENRY YORKE having been voted to the Chair, he business was ‘opened by reading the following Address to the king, in behalf of the suffering patriots : 
GARROW 3892 “ TO THE KING. 
GARROW 3893 “ An Address from the Inhabitants of the Town and Neighbourhood of Sheffield, in the County of York. 
GARROW 3894 “ Sirnzr; We, the undersigned, being warm friends of liberty and the rights of man, feel ourselves deeply affected by the sentences which have lately been passed in your majesty’s courts of Scotland, upon citizens Muir, Palmer, Skirving, Margarot, and Gerrald. 
GARROW 3895 ‘Had these ‘men been really guilty of crimes, their punisliment should doubtless have been proportionate to their offences ; but, so far from considering it as a crime for a man to use every constitutional means in his power to effect a reform in the Commons House of Parliament, we think that every man who thus exerts himself, deserves well of his country; since we are persuaded that nothing short of the accomplishment of such a reform will restore peace and happiness to our present aggrieved and injured nation. 
GARROW 3896 “ We trusted also, that your majesty entertained the same opinion with us of such exalted conduct, from your majesty’s having chosen for your most confidential servants in the state, men who had singularly distinguished themselves by their patriotic exertions in the cause of parliamentary reform : 
GARROW 3897 “ But the friends of these sufterers having brought their case before parliament, without producing the desired effect—the principal of these very servants of your majesty having opposed the measure with all his corrupt, but irresistible influence—seeing no other resource, we approach your majesty in this address, to intreat your majesty to interfere in behalf of these (whom we deem) innocent men, with that power which the British constitution has placed in your majesty, of pardoning whom your majesty pleases—a privilege which is sometimes graciously extended even to real and palpable criminals. 
GARROW 3898 “Let it not be recorded in the history of this country, that king George 3rd, or any of his judges, transported men for fourteen years, because they had dared to speak the same words upon a speculative subject, which, if they were not the immediate means of adwancing his majesty’s then prime minister toobedience to it could result solely from mohis high situation, caused his election to be ; tives of fear. That liberty of opinien could remarkably popular: let it not be said, thatnot be denied to any free country, without men of education, of refined sentiments, ofdenying at the same time the rights of the the most virtuous and benevolent characters, peuple. That nothing argued more strongly were severed from their dearest connexions, ; against a government than the uniform pe and plunged into dungeuns with thieves andsign of depriving the people of this liberty ; prostitutes: letit not be said, that fathers worethat it was a proof that something went torn from their wives and children, and sonswrong ; and that even governors were from their aged parents, because they had the ashamed of their conduct, when the right of virtue openly to condemn the acknowledgeddiscussion was violated, or put an end to. corruptions of government, and to exert every The civil liberty we enjoyed in our eountry peaceable means in their power to remove was the effect of political discussion ; amd its them: let it not be said, that it was as great political liberty would have long since been a crime to speak the rruta, as to be guilty restored and secured, if our rulers had not of FELONY. 
GARROW 3899 “ But rather, O king, let it be recorded, : that George 3rd had the wisdom, the huma-' 
GARROW 3900 nity, and the justice, to step in betwixt these severe and cruel sentences and their execution. 
GARROW 3901 hese are our desires—these our plain sentiments. We know they are such as your majesty is unaccustomed to hear; but, if they are supported by truth and reason, suffer not the homeliness of our manner to offend your majesty. We are plain men, and will not flatter a king. If our wishes be attended to, we are persuaded it will, in some good degree, hush the murmurs which unreasonable severity in a government never fails to excite; and it may also avert that storm, which it is but too evident has long been awfully gathering, and which may burst forth in a moment when your majesty thinks not. 
GARROW 3902 “ The address being read, and received with repeated applauses, Hrnry Yorkr addressed the meeting in support of the measure. He observed, that the cause for which our countrymen were now suffering, was the same as had been advocated in the year 1783, by Mr. Pitt, the duke of Richmond, and other men, who were at this time pensioners and placemen under the actual government; that a convention, for the purpose of obtaining a 
GARROW 3903 Pasaeinen tary reform, had been held at the hatched House Tavern, in which these men went as delegates, or acted as assistants ; that ’ 
GARROW 3904 it was cruel, if not unjust, to punish men for following the example which those in power had set them. ‘The question was not a question of convenience, but of right
BROOMHEAD 3905 It was not enough to say, that the people were formerly Fepresented, but that they had a right to he Tepresented now. Did the ministry, therefore, mean to assert, that what was right today, was wrong to-morrow? Did they mean to declare, in the face of the world, that what was in conformity to the maxims of justice at that time, should, in so short a space, be deemed unjust, and punished as a crime ? “After having expatiated considerably on this very important subject, he proceeded with observing, that in all countries where severe and sanguinary punishments were encouraged, men could have no affection for the government under which they lived, and their ig se) to weaken or spells this right: 
GARROW 3906 rst, iving a power of decisiun to j stich the ancieat lars of the land did aed knowledge: secondly, by confounding the truth with the fact of publication: and, ‘thirdly, by having punished with the utmost severity libels in private cases, to prepare the public mind for those severe sentences in public ones, -which dishonoured and irritated the nation. It had been lately the fashion to confound government with the constitution, and the ministry with the government. Tooppose, therefore, the mad and wild, if not criminal schemes of administration, was to Oppose government, and, by this mode of reasoning, to oppose government was to be an enemy to the constitution. A govemment can never give a more authentic proof of its propension to tyranny, and of the impropriety, as well as impolicy of its measures, ‘than by restraining or Prbidding the liberty of discussing publicly matters of legisiation and policy. It is debasing the character of man, as an intellectual being, to deny him the right of inquiring into that which even governors allow was made for his use, namely, government. 
GARROW 3907 “Yo punish inquiry, severity is exercised for imaginary guilt. But what is the effect? Mischiet is prolific: violence in government begets resentment in the people, who murmur and exclaim: government is provoked, and studies vengeance. When one act of vengeance is exposed, more always follow. Af-fection is lost on both sides, and, what is worse, is irrecoverable. Hatred begins; and the government and the people being at variance, consider each other no longer as magistrate and subject, but as mutual enemies. Hience the inhuman wish of Caligula, that he could murder all the people at one blow. The sequel is in order: he is continually destroying them; they are continually wishing him destroyed. Such conduct had the fa tendency of cramping the genius of men, andof replunging the nation into a state of bar-barism with regard to their religion, ther Jaws, their morals, and their government, andto keep them ignorant of the most important concerns in their trade, their splendour, theirfelicity ; whilst all the nations around themeee improving themeclves in morals and policy, by the dering efforts and concurrence of enlightened men, whose views were directed to those objects alone which were really worth their attention. The reasoning of a vernment, which prohibits information, is fective in every parti 3 its progress is not to be stopped, nor even to be checked, without mannii disadvantage. Prohibition has no other effect than to irritate men; to inspire them with an idea of insurrection, and to giveto all their writings a libellous tendency, Severe and arbitrary sentences may intimidate, but they cannot conzince a nation. It is by reason and argument alone, opposed to apparent reason end apparent argument, that a mment can hope to be victorious over ite-internal enemies, or render itself permanent by the quiet and conscientious concurrence of all its citizens. It is doing too much honeur to innocent subjects to be alarmed at a few pages of writing, or at a few fugitive orations, when barracks are erected in a country, and 60,000 armed nvercenaries are ready to execute the mandates of government. Experience had proved, that the rigorous prosecutions which had lately taken place throughout England, and that the cruel sentences which had disgraced the capital of Scotland, had not answered the purpose of establishing arbitrary power, and of crushing the rebellion of honest minds. Although there is no spirit so erect and independent as not to be broken hy the long continuance ofthe silent and inglorious sufferings of a gaol; yet it had been found, that men were proud to step forward in this most stormy season, when. such terrible examples of legal vengeance had been held up hefore them, to plead the ancient rights oe their country, to unmask the infamy, intrigue, and murderous projects of administration, and, according to : the principles of the purest benevolence, toassert the liberty of the whole human race.‘The present times bore a strong and marked ! resemblance to those terrific ages when priestsheld their dominion over the minds and consciences of men, and when they endeavouredto establish the reign of intolerance and orthodoxy amidst flakes of fire, and streams of human blood. All history had evinced, that every attempt to curb and bridle the expansion of the human mind had been inettectual; it had evinced, that opinions, though smothered for a time, burst forth with redoubled fury, and were victorious over power; it had evinced the triumph of reason and truth over prejudice and superstition, and that liberty, whether of opinion or person, however slow in its progress, had uniformly moved forward towards its destined goal; and that even, at this moment, the interruptions which had been opposed to it in our own country, although they might be imjurious to individuals, would finally obtain, confirm, and establish the rights of the people. Conscious of their uprightness, the friends of freedom had persevered in their noble cause, unappalled by the influence of spies and informers, and by the threats of a corrupt, a crazy, and wicked administration. 
GARROW 3908 In so doing, they had acted in perfect conformity to the principles of virtue, without which no man could be a friend to his country, anda lover of mankind. Its essence consisted in the regulation of oue conduct by such moral axioms as are best calculated to promote the general happiness of our fellowcreatures; and as it frequently happened, that the happiness of the tndividual stood in direct opposition to that of the public, it is the perfection of virtue in individuals to sacrifice their own happiness to that of the public. A man, in possession of this virtuous principle, feels delight whilst actually buming in the brazen bull of Phalaris; and such, he trusted, was the actuating principle of those generous patriots, who are become willing victims of the most barbarous and savage sentences that ever had been pronounced in 
GARROW 3909 Britain; who had made a glorious stand aguinst arbitrary power, and who broke loose trom the fondest endearments of human life, in the hope of redeeming their lost country from the fangs of a dark and brooding prejudice, and fron the horrors and turpitude of an igneminious slavery. 
GARROW 3910 t was the tyranny of the British government which drove William Pena, with the Pelscophie people called Quakers, to the deectable regions of Pennsyivania, where, by toleration, industry, and permanent credit, they revived the simplicity of the primitive ages of society. It was the same tyranny which has driven into voluntaay exile, or forced by law into banishment, the most virtuous of men, the first of philosophers, the most exalted and courageous band of patriots that ever honoured the soil of Britain. Among the former Joseph Priestley, one of the most profound philosophers of the age, and most meek au amiuble of citizens, claims the sad pre-eminence ; and among the latter, stand the names of those persecuted patriots, in whose behalf we are pow about to address the exccutive magistrate of our country—a noble and a generous band, whose sufferings do not claim our pity, because they boil up our rage; whose sentences disgraced those who pronounced them, not those on whom they were pronounced; whose condition is enviable, because honourable, and to the whole of whose opinions and conduct, no good man, or honest citizen, can give one dissentient voice! In times like these, when a man is mocked and insulted, because he bears the name of a patriot, an epithet once honoured by the people of England; at a time when those who have the courage and magnanimity not to flatter their country, are deserted, betrayed, and persecuted, what honours are sufficient for oe ve thunder truth against tyranny? What disgrace ought not to aout ose. ted beings, those re tize patriots, who keep aloof from the scene of action, and riot on their country’s wrongs? When our nation shall be regenerated, thesepersecuted nen will wear civic crowns. In the political, as in the moral world, the friend who appears to soothe our distresses, excites our esteem; and he who, in calamitous times that try men’s souls, sacrifices interest, friends, and home, iv order to save his sinking country, merits well, not only of every Briton, but of all maukind, and even of the government under which he lives. 
GARROW 3911 “ Fellow Citizens, the day is at length arrived, when fanaticism and superstition, deprived of their tinsel trappings, and exposed, in their native ugliness, to the view of mankind, slink scowling back to the cave of obscurity; there I hope they will for ever remain. The energy of Englishmen will no longer endure this strange uproar of injustice. I trust my countrymen are sick of religious and political imposture ; and that their decisive and manly conduct will command, in an imperious tone which will take no denial, not a melioration of these enormous abuses, which would be to compromise with injustice; but I trust they will demand the annihilation of corruptions and abuses, and a restitution of the original rights of human nature. I ask of our governors, this pe question, is itbetter that the people should be in a constant state of stupidity, than that they should be sometimes turbulent
BROOMHEAD 3912 Ministers of state, if ye mean to be wicked, suffer the people to write and speak ; you will find men corrupt enough to serve you according to your evil desires, and who will improve you in the art of Sejanus. If you mean to be good, permit them to write, you will find some honest men who will improve you in the art of a Turgot. How many things are ye still ignorant of, before you can become great either in good or in evil? I see no glory, no advantage, no pleasure, no safety, in any man reigning as a sultan over slaves. Such a horrid pre-eminence tarnishes the lustre of the most exalted station, It is, besides, precarious, for sultans are frequently deposed, and vengeance wreaked upon them. 
GARROW 3913  need not invite you, fellow citizens, to feel for any human being who suffers, much less need I solicit your approof of the present measure, after the general testimony of satisfaction you have given of it. You are too enlightened to need the aid of any instruction from me, and your understandings are too much amakened to require that your passions should be played upon. Whilst the unerring tribunal of posterity shall condemn with scorn and derision, with execration and disgust, those inbuman beings who have been the causes of such unexampled and inhuman severity, our persecuted brethren will obtain a verdict of honour and glory. I may venture to say, that beloved by the present age, future ae shall heap around their monuments trophies of undying fame; and an exasperated and repentant people, shall enroll their names in the volume of history, which records also the names of Sidney, Hampden and Locke! 
GARROW 3914 “ The following Resolutions were then read three times over, and with the exception of one or two persons, were unanimously adopted : 
GARROW 3915 “1, That the people, being the true and only souree of government, the Seetoca of speaking and writing upon any subject, can not be denied to the ineribers 8 a vernment, without offering the grassest insult to the majesty of the people. 
GARROW 3916 “g, That therefore the condemnation of citizens Muir, Palmer, Skirving, Margarot, and Gerrald, to transportation, for exposing the corruptions of the British government, was an act better suited to the maxims of a despotic than a free government. 
GARROW 3917 “ 3, That the address which has now beer read, be presented to the king, in behalf of the above persecuted patriots. 
GARROW 3918 “ On the second resolution being proposed, an hiss'was heard from different parts of the meeting, in consequence of one or two persons holding up their hats against it; on obe serving which, H. Yorke thus ad the meeting: 
GARROW 3919 “ Fellow Citizens; As your chairman I call you to order. As an individual, I must observe, that this hissing is repugnant to the principle of toleration or freedom, which we wish to see established. We have this moment read, and given our assent to, an address to the king in favour of liberty of opinion ; let it not be said, that we are the first to violate thatliberty in others, which we claim for ourselves. Opinions will always vary, even amongst the wisest and bestot men. Weare bound, therefore, to show tenderness to the opinions of others, and compassion even to their prejudices. Let our enemies see that we consecrate by our example, what we desire to see established as a principle. Hisses do not convince; they tend only to irritate the minds, and to beget the ill-will of our fellow citizens: let us, on the contrary, confront them with the weapons of reason and truth, the onl logic of liberal minds. Every thing whic! has a tendency to stir up the passions without awakening the understanding is unbecoming of freemen, or of men who would be free. 
GARROW 3920 “ These well-timed observations had the good effect of preventing any further signs of Intolerance; and the utmost decorum pre
GARROW 3921 ‘vailed throughout the conduct of the business, 
GARROW 3922 “ It was next moved, ‘ that a petition be presented to the House of Commons, for a reform in the representation of the people in parliament ;’ but so marked was the disaps probation pre by the whole meeting to this Measure, that not one single person seconded the motion; but a most profound silence, interrupted only by a few murmurs, was observed: upon which, Henry Yorke again rose, and addressed the meeting in an animated speech of an hour long, and of which it is impossible for us to give our readers a just conception. He took a general view of the British constitution, and stated its most prominent defects; among which the want of a perfect natienal representation was the most laring. He dwelt a considerable time upon is subject, and then proceeded to take a rapid survey of the exertions which had been made at different periods, and by different persons, to promote the cause of parliamentary teform. 
GARROW 3923 “ He observed that the subject was become a mere bugbear, employed to deceive the peole, and worked upon as an engine to raise into power, needy and ambitious men: that the very same men who in opposition had declared that it was the only measure of saving the country from ruin, were the first to reprobate and scout the measure of reform when they were in power, From the corruptions of the British government, parties had been generated, which in their route to power, had convulsed and plundered the empire. Under the distinctions of names, principles had been forgotten; and for the sake of leaders, whom the people had foolishly idolized, the machine of government rolled on amidst the feuds and contentions of party. Eternally the peace of our country had been distarbell by the rancour and animosities of factions, and the people, instead of turning themselves to correct the gross evils which existed in it, had ever been the tools of base and designing men, and seemed prepared to whet and sharpen their swords one against another. 
GARROW 3924 “It was now high time that the people should lay asideleaders, discard, factionsand act 
GARROW 3925 Sor themselves. He strongly inforced these principles, and then pa into a complete detail of the ancient constitution as established by Alfred, which he proved to be at this time totally defaced, if not lost. He then pursued the gradual decline of popular liberty in EngJand, from the anarchy which was the consequence of Danish and Norman invasion; and taking a general sketch of our history, so far as it was connected with the subject of popular representation, he made some strong and pointed remarks on the Revolution in 1688, the object of which, he said, was not, could not be answered, unless annual parliaments and ee sufirage were restored. For this he the authority of lord Sommers, who drew up the declaration of rights, and who was promoted by William 3rd for his popular exertions at that memorable epoch. 
GARROW 3926 “ In order to prove that the Revolution had not corresponded with the expectations of the people, no sooner was the prince of Orange established on the throne of England, than all ideas of the ancient mode of annual parliaments were effaced, and the TRIENNIAL ACT was passed in the very face of that revolution, and in direct contradiction to its principles; for the revolution, at least so far as it respected the people, was not intended to be a compromise between the king and the aristocracy, for the joint inheritance of the people, but to establish on unequivocal principles the right of the people to govern themselves, and to recall those delegated powers which they had entrusted to their servants for this purpose, when they were either abused, or neglecte to exercise them. If the revolution were not a revolution for the people, it was no revolution at all, but a conspiracy of a few ennobled oppressors against the liberties and happiness ofthe many. Butif it were designed to comprehend the people, and its end has been perverted, or purposely laid aside, the people are not warranted in petitioning, but are justified in demanding as a Right, agreeably to the tone of language used in the declaration of rights, the restitution of annual parliaments, and the establishment of universal suffrage. But the shock which was given to the stability of these principles, was most infamously flagrant, by the enacting of the sEPTENNIAL act, in the reign of George 1st. If the act of parliament in the reign of Henry 6th, erased from the roll of citizenship some of the best members of the community; the enacting of the triennial and septennial acts, filled up to the brim the measure of governmental iniquity, and poured forth the waters of bitterness throughout our land. 
GARROW 3927 “Frtrow Citizens; Enough of precedent. The human race has long been rolling down the tide of ages neglected, unpitied, an oppressed. It is Tigh time that the devious course of human policy should not be left to the uncertain issue of storms and of elemental wars; but that the machine of state should be guided by the polar star of reason alone, which is never seen but when the majesty of the people is resplendent. What is beneficial in the example of ages, we ought to reserve with caution. What is injurious, and what is only tolerably competent to answer the common purposes of society, ought to be abolished. We insult ourselves, when we abjectly distrust the powers which nature has given us; nor ought we passively to acquiesce in institutions whic, though injurious, may be preferable to those that may be endured by others. We insult ourselves, when we foolishly balance between tolerable vices and positive good ; between unnatural systems, and Novel, untried, but just maxims. ‘The human mind is progressive, so is the social mind. That the one therefore should remain stationary, amid the rapid course of the other towards perfection, is a prejudice as unnatural as it is injurious to the happiness of man. The governments of Europe present no delectable symmetry to the contemplation of the philosopher, no enjoyment to the satisfaction of the citizen. A vast, deformed and cheerless structure, the frightful abortion of haste and usurpation, presents to the eye of the beholder no systematic arrangement, no harmonious organization of society. Chance, haste, faction, tyranny, massacre, and the hot, inclement action of human passions, have begotten them. Utility never has been the end of their institution, but partial interest has been its fruit. Such abominable and absurd forms, such jarring and dissonant principles, which chance has scattered over the earth, cry aloud for something more natural, more pure, and more calculated to promote the happiness of mankind. Experience must regulate the mechanism of government, by which I mcan not a narrow and confined, but a liberal and enlightened experience, which, hearing without passion or prejudice, the testimony of ages and nations, collects from it general principles, to further the progress of civilization. It is in history that we are to dive for those rich materials of legislative experiment, which are to ameliorate the social order, and repair those breaches which injustice has long since made. But if this experience be found inadequate to the purpose of alleviating human miseries ; if it afford nothing but the melancholy prospect of outradespotism; of excessive vices on the pert of the governing, and debasement and vassallage on that of the ed; if it ascribe the commeotions of sufiering countries to the designs of factions, asd not to principles; if it show, that in consequence of national ignorance, after the first ebullitions of revolt, they have sat down in a torpid calm, and borne with usurpations stili heavier than those by which they were roused te arms—it must be ted that this experience is important; use it teaches the suffering nations of the present day, in what manner to prepare their combustible ingredients, and humanists in what mamner to enkindle them, so as to produce, with effect, that grand political explosion, which, at the same time that it buries despotiam, already convulsive and agonising, in rains, may raise up the people to the dignity and sublime grandeur of freedom. 
GARROW 3928 e effect this just and useful purpose, reselution. of sentineng must precede revolution of government and manners. The popular energies must be excited, thas the popular voice may befeltandheard. The people must grow wise, im order that the people may rule. It is said we preach anarchy, but what is anarchy but: the establishment. of confusion on the wreck of popular opinion? It is said we are levelless; bus those are levcllers who would. wish to seduce man to the condition of the brute, guided by passion, and wninfuenced. by reason. Those are levellers whose hands are dipped in the public spoils; who assert inxpusity fer crimes, and inviolahility of persona ; who would make humanity take a retrograde motion; who would paisy the arm of justice, and defeat the endof equal laws. bape have ever disclaimed the foolish idea of levelling property ; because our own pyu i the fruit of our laboar, or of our fet en wae by the examale, be exposed to the invasion of the first mtrudes. It were well, if those who confound justice with crimes, would consider that the poor man's property, little as it is, is as precious to him, as is the wealthy stock of the rich man. It were well, if fecling the force of this principle, the aristocracy would unite with us in the cguse in which we are embarked. Property, they say, iseaered—Is not then the property of the poor man as sacred as that of the rich; and ought it to be filched or forced from him without his consent, any move than that ef the rich man? Can these ; who do not respect the property of otbers, expect others to respect their property? We wish to exail, not te level. We wish to better the condition of the wretched; to equalize men under the influence of law; but te give to merit, industry, talents, patrimony, virtee, their proper weight and correspendent dignity in the social order. Are we then ungoivernable, because we rcjeet mis-government? Are we ungrateful, because we defend cur liberty and property against those who ought to respect them? Are we rebels in manmtaining our violated laws against those whe ase open rebels to laws, and who set themselves above those laws which they ought to have venerated? I know, that in all ages of the world, people who would not be oppressed have been reckoned ungovernable by mea who are, or who would be oppressurs. I know that the enemies of oppression have always becn stigmatized as enemies of goverament. I knew that it is seditious to blame the excesses of power, and insolent to mentioa the insolence of those who abuse power. I know that it is sedition to distinguish between public right and public wrong, between government and tyranny. Nor is it enough to acknowledge all good government to be irresistible ; but the worst, and the abuse of the dest, must be irresistible also. I know that to complaia of tyranny is faction, and to ; throw it off rebedlion; but they who oppress are the greatest Rebeds, and for the oppressed to tusn upon them, is but to resist Rebellion— it is but to do a just and nateral action. Whoever violates the laws of reason, equity, and nature, whatever station or name he may bear, is a Rebel, subject to laws against tyrants and rebellion. ‘Tyrants, theretore, and oppressors, are the highest and most consummate rebels in the world—capital traitors to God and Man, and punishable by all the laws of God and Man. Amid all the absordities and chimeras of paganism, it was never believed that tyranny was warranted by heaven. It was never believed that the bloody Caligula was the vicegerent of God, and that the worst of men had a commission from heaven to oppress the human race. It was never believed that murder, rapine, and misrule, were government; and that lawless and bloody crowned robbers, were governors divinely appointed. It was never believed that society had no remedy against devouring lust the raging sword, which were destroying all the ends of society, and even society itself Such indignitics 
GARROW 3929 God and man were never broached by pagans;attempt be made to wrest what remains of they never propagated doctrines which would have turned men into idcots, destitute of reflection and fecling; into beasts of burthen and beasts of sacrifice; turned heaven into hell; human society into a chaos of blood and carcases; and the earth into a place of torments. It never entered into the heart of a Greek or a Roman, nor into any heart that felt the sentiments of virtue and humanity, that it was unlawful to defend nature; a crime to ward off murder, barbarity, and desolation; and an impiety to do the most godlike action which can be done on this side heaven, that of disarming tyrants, and of saving our country from perishing. Government is doubtless a sacred thing, and justly claims our reverence and duty; Sut when government is general oppression; when havoc, spoil, and persecution prevail, to the destruction of all who do well; when law and justice are banished, and military despotism triumphs; when property is attacked and seized without the consent of its owner, and lives are wantonly destroyed ! —is this government too? If it be, tell me what is not government? I do not think, in an age like this, that the people of this, or any country, can ever be so sunk or deadened by oppression, but that repeated provocation will raise a spirit amongst them capable of accomplishing the greatest projects. Even the most professed and degraded slaves, the people of Turkey, often rouse themselves, and casting thcir proud rider to the earth, trample him to death. A little spark often kindles a great flame, and a flame soon spreads to a conilagration. An ignorant mation roused to assert its liberties, will be mad and furious; for when men are used like beasts, they will act like beasts! But when an enlightened people, knowIng their rights, are reduced to a state of degradation, they will know thattheir condition cannot be worse, but, by their own efforts, their condition must be Better. An ignorant people, incited by repeated injury to shake off the load of injustice, will risk unseen evils and calamities—will risk even a civil war to be revenged on their oppressors. Such was the temper of the Romans upon the revolt of Sacrovir—they even exulted in it, and in hatred to Tiberius, wished success to the public enemy. — Such were the injured people of Spain, who, when the Romans came, joyfully received them as their deliverers from the tyrannous yoke of Carthage. But an enlightened people will never sully the victories of patriotism by such irregular conduct Revenge will never be adopted as aa principle nour, and they will glory in awaiting the slow process of universal information, as a prelude to universal emancipation, rather than tarnish the career of liberty, by involving their country in scenes of terror, waste and depredation. Oppressed nature will, at a proper season, depart from passive principle ; and should an liberty from us, I trust all men will concur to vindicate their violated rights—tor, if the lived be suffered once, it will be often repeated. A few repetitions create a habit, and habit will claim prescription and right. For governors to be omnipotent, the race of man must be extinct; and no argument for destroying anarchy can be used, but what is full as strong for the overthrow of tyranny. It is difficult to restore public affairs, when once disconcerted, to their former steady principle—numbers will engage in the cors tuption, and will try every art and power to support it, and they will continue to do so, until nature, which is always uppermost in Man, signs their tragical doom ! 
GARROW 3930 “ Citizens, I repeat my former assertion. Go on as you hitherto have done, in the cul
GARROW 3931 Peace will actuate their demea-. 
GARROW 3932 ture of reason, Disseminate throughout the ; whole of your country, that knowledge which is so necessary to man’s happiness, and which you have yourselves acquired. Teach your j children and your countrymen the sacred lessons of virtue, which are the foundations of all human polity. Teach them to respect themselves, and to love their country. Teach them to do unto all men as they would that they should do unto them, and thcir love shall ; not be confined to their country, but shall ex tend to the whole human race. When sucha revolution of sentiment shall have dispersed the mists of prejudice ; when by the incessant thunderings from the press, the meanest cot-tager of our country shall be enlightened, and the sun of reason shall shine in its fullest meridian over us; then the commanding voice of the whole people shall recommend the five hundred and fifty-eight gentlemen in St. Stephen’s Chapel, to go about their business. 
GARROW 3933 “ The following Resolutions were next read, and unanimously approved of, amidst the loudest applauses. 
GARROW 3934 “4, Thatin every country where the people have no share in their government, taxation is ae 
GARROW 3935 “ 5, That therefore a government is tyrannical or free, in proportion as the people are equally, or unequally, represented. 
GARROW 3936 “6. Convinced of this truth, it is the opinion of this meeting, that the people ought to demand as a right, and not petition as afavour, for universal representation, 
GARROW 3937 “7, That therefore we will petition the TJouse of Commons no more on this subject. 
GARROW 3938 “ An Address to the British Nation. “Friends and Countrymen; We have heard this day decided, with the exception of only one dissentient voice, that the House of 
GARROW 3939 Commons shall never again be petitioned by us, on the subject of parliamentary reform. 
GARROW 3940 “ We owe to the nation, to posterity, even to foreign countries, and to the government 
GARROW 3941 Itself under which we live, an exposition of our motives. To the nation we owe this duty, because we are of opinion, that THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE, SHOULD BE, AT ALL TIMES, THE SUPREME LAW; and that if the few dissent from the opinion of the many, however obligatory the will of the majority may be to them as arule of action, yet opinion is always free and sacred, the right of man to enjoy, and the conscientious duty of man to diffuse. Under the full conviction of this principle, we feel ourselves, at present, the mimority, because we are the first to agitate the question, and to repel the monstrous idea of Pentontng when our petitions are not received by the House of Commons. But, we are numerous—we are many thousands; and as nothing opens the eyes of men so much as their interests, we demand, fellow-citizens, way, we are entitled to it from our numbers, that you lend an attentive ear to the truths we are about to utter, and tothe reclamations we are about to make in favour of oppressed humanity. 
GARROW 3942 “ Our petition was received with the utmost indignation by the House of Commons ; which was no more than we expected. We knew that the homely truths we uttered, would be very unwelcome guests in that house. We never expected that a body in which there were so many placemen and pensioners, would listen to the palpable facts stated in that petition; the object of which was to root out injustice, and to curb licentiousness and corruption. Nevertheless, as we were called upon by our countrymen to unite with them, we ;thonght ourselves bound to comply with their wishes, And, although our petition was disdainfully rejected, because not couched in language sufficiently polite and respectful for the five hundred and fifty-eight gentlemen who sit at the House of Commons, yet, believe us, FELLOW-CITIZENS, we are still of opinion, that the matter it contained, was not only just and Proper, but we think, that even the language, which gave so much offence to the honourable &entlemen, was much too polite and too moderate for us. For, if the House of Commons were the real representatives of the people, we certainly had a right to dictate, and not to petition, because they could be considered in no other light than as the organs of the public will. And, if they refused to obey that will, they would be usurpers, and not representatives. If, on the contrary, they are not the representatives of the people, what have we to do with them? If they are not our representatives, we cannot be their constituents ; and to petition those who are not our representatives as our representatives, would be a manifest absurdity, if not’ an insult and mockery of ourselves, However, the petition, such as it was, being termed disrespectful, was thrown out bya majority of 79, there being 29 only who voted for its being received, and 108 who voted against it, Such imperious treatment rather gives warning than strikes terror. The abuse of representation can never come in the place of a rule, for no legal power can be derived from injury or injustice. On this ground alone, therefore, we are justified in preserving a sullen silence m respect to the House of Commons. For, if grievances, abuses, complaints, and truth, are to be discarded from that House, because not dressed in a gentleman-like language, how are we, plain mechanics, ever to obtain redress, who are not gentlemen, and who are, consequently, ignorant of those polite and courtly expressions which are necessary to gain a hearing in that House. We are ignorant of the art of displaying truth by halves, and, as we love plain dealing ourselves, we detest hypocrisy in others, and pity those who would wish us to follow their cxample. We said to the House of Commons, we are wronged and aggrieved—will you right us, and redress our grievances, or will you not? If you will, we shall be satisfied; if you will not, we shall seek redress some other way. This is the sole question with us, and we put it, as we thought, in a most becoming style to the House of Commons. But, our petition bei scouted, we shall trouble them no more wit! our coarse and unmannerly language. It will be our duty to proceed, as we have uniformly done hitherto, in enlightening the public mind; and, when a complete revolution of sentiment shall take place (as will shortly be the case) in our country, we shall open our mouths, in that key we think most agreeable to ourselves; and our voice, together with that of our disfranchised countrymen, will resemble, perhaps, the thunderings from Mount Sinai! 
GARROW 3943 “ Yes, countrymen, we demand equality of rights, in which is included equality of representation, without which terror is law, and the obligations of justice are weakened ; because, unsanctioned by the sacred voice of 
GARROW 3944 }the people. We are not speaking of that visionary equality of property, the practical assertion oF biel weld vetolate the world, and replunge it into the darkest and wildest barbarism ; but that equality we claim, is to make the slave a man, the man a citizen, and the citizen an imtegral part of the state; to make him a joint sovereign, and not a subject; to oblige law, which ought to be an emanation from the general will, to shed its influence, without distinction, over the heads of all, and to restrain or strike the wealthy poses equally with the more homely otender. We onto give rights to him who has none, and a country to San who wants one. We wish to upset the idol of injustice, which has poured forth, from its exalted throne, a deluge of sorrow, and flooded the world with the tears and the blood of its inhabitants. We desire to see wisdom demanding of miserable millions their wants, humanity at hand to supply them. We de sire to see the sanctuary of virtue erected, and the standard of liberty planted in our land, around which the people may rally as to an holy of holies. In short, we desire to see the altar of equality blazing in Britain, whose streams of fire, whilst they shall shock, convulse, and tear down the rotten pillars of prejudices; whilst they shall consume tyrants, and terrify public delinquents, shall pierce into the hearts of the whole people, and confirm the wide empire of morals on the wreck of superstition and vice. Such is our equality, and such is the equality which we proudly gratulate our countrymen, will shortly be established in Britain, and which we invite pou PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND, to partake of
BROOMHEAD 3945 The ks of the Forth, the fields of Bannockburn and Culloden, and that tribunal of Edinburgh, which has disgraced your capital, shall yet bear testimony to the cause for which FLetcuer wrote, and Wattace bled. 
GIBBS 3946  You said, about the time these pikes were talked about, there had been a mischievous band-bill circulated, for the purpose, as you Suppose, of exciting the people against the Society ; can you tell me what was the general substance of it
BROOMHEAD 3947 I had one in my hand, but cannot speak to every thing it contained. 
GIBBS 3948 But what was the general substance of it
BROOMHEAD 3949 It was a call to the people to arm against foreign and internal enemies, and the reply which was made to it was couched in the same 
GIBBS 3950 That was the first thing that was published ; at what time was it published? before or after this meeting that you speak of
BROOMHEAD 3951 I do not recollect the exact time, but I read them both, and should have been happy if I had had them both here. 
GIBBS 3952 But you say the object of it was to provoke the people 
BROOMHEAD 3953 It was given out, by various people in the town of Sheffield, we can never do any thing against these people, against the society, till we ourselves cause a riot. 
GIBBS 3954 people meant the society 
BROOMHEAD 3955 Yes; and I saw myself several persons ride up -and down, round the market-place, full gallop, to ride over people, when, at the same time, it was only boys. 
GIBBS 3956 ‘The cry was, they could never do any thing with yous unless they caused a riot against ou, they could make nothing of ite—it has been said so, but I cannot recollect who said At; but this wicked hand-bill appearing, without the sanction of the law, or the magistrate, —Ireadit; and, if I had been aware of this, I would have brought it; this was the cause of any thing being spoken concerning arms, 
GIBBS 3957 Among all the conversation you have ever heard upon the subject of these pikes, were they intended for the purpose of making an attack upon any power in this country, or onl. for defending yourselves, if you should be attacked
BROOMHEAD 3958 I never understood them in any other light, and what was said about them was in answer to this wicked hand-bill. There was neither Mr. Wilkinson’s name, nor Mr. Althorp’s, nor any gentleman’s name in the town to it. 
GIBBS 3959 Whether you ever collected, from those who talked of pikes, or ever produced any, that they meant to make any attack upon any of the powers in this country, or only to defend theinselves, if they were illegally attacked 
BROOMHEAD 3960 This was the very truth ; to oppose illegal force, and direct violation of the law of the land, made upon us, as was done at Manchester and at Birmingham. 
GIBBS 3961 Then they were meant only to be used ow the defensive 
BROOMHEAD 3962 Mr. Gale had this hand-bill in his hand, when he first mentioned the pikes at this meeting, or in his pocket; and there were several resolves printed in his paper the week following, and direct answers thereto, mentioning something upon tHe matter. I would have brought them both with me, if I had been apprehensive of this. 
GIBBS 3963 Had any of the people in this society to which you belonged, any idea of making any attack upon either the King, or the House of Lords? had they any idea of altering the government in that respect 
BROOMHEAD 3964 I think they ought to be sent to Bedlam, if they had. 
GIBBS 3965 Had you, as one of that socicty, any such intention yourself
BROOMHEAD 3966 Just the same as flying to the sun. 
GIBBS 3967 But to speak plain; by that you mean, I suppose, that you never had any such thought in your mind
BROOMHEAD 3968 No; never. What was it that you wished to produce by these meetings of yours ?—To enlighten the people ; to show the people the reason, the ground of all their complaints and sufferings ; when a man works hard for thirteen or fourteen hours of the day, the week through, and is not able to maintain his family; that is what I understood of it; to show the people the ground of this; why they were not able. 
GIBBS 3969 Was not the object of your meeting a parliamentary reform 
BROOMHEAD 3970 Yes, it was ; and as such we corresponded with the society of the Friends of the People, as well as the Constitutional Society. 
GIBBS 3971 Who were the members of the Friends of the People 
BROOMHEAD 3972 There were several communications, I know, received from that society. 
GIBBS 3973 Mr. Stuart, I believe was the secretary 
BROOMHEAD 3974 Yes. 
GIBBS 3975 Should you have continued a member of this society, ifyou had thoughtthat they had any intent of shaking either the king, or the lords, or of displacing the king from his throne
BROOMHEAD 3976 No. 
GIBBS 3977 You would not 
BROOMHEAD 3978 No. 
GIBBS 3979 Should you not have abhorred such en idea 
BROOMHEAD 3980 Yes, yes, 
GIBBS 3981 Have you any reason, from any thing that ever passed in the society, to believe there was a single member of it who entertained such a notion
BROOMHEAD 3982 No; andI do not believe there is such a wicked man amongst them. 
GIBBS 3983 The object of your meeting, you say, was to state to the people the grounds of certain evils which you thought to exist; and wished to bring about a parliamentary refurm. Ws that a parliamentary reform in the House of Commons
BROOMHEAD 3984 In the House of Commons. 
GIBBS 3985 You meant that the king and the lords should remain as they were ; but that there should be a reform in the House of Commons? woe Yes. 
GIBBS 3986 Did you believe, and was that the ground upon which you acted, that by producing such reform as you wished in the House of Commons, that those evils would be remedied 
BROOMHEAD 3987 That the King, the Lords, and Commons, might themselves, with the concurrence of the nation, remedy these evils. As to reforming, as to the expenditure, and other matre we had not the vanity to think of sucha thing. 
GIBBS 3988 ‘Then do I understand you right, when I suppose this to have been your principle— that you thought the King, and the Lords, with the House of Commons, so reformed, would redress all your grievances 
BROOMHEAD 3989 Yes. 
GIBBS 3990 Was it your object to attain this end peaceably 
BROOMHEAD 3991 Thereis no one doubts itin Sheffield, that will speak honestly. 
GIBBS 3992 T speak of your own particular object— Your object was to attain it peaceably 
BROOMHEAD 3993 It avas. 
GIBBS 3994 Have you any reason to think it was the object of any other man in the society, to use any but peaceable means to obtain it 
BROOMHEAD 3995 Not to my knowledg, hat persons might do, had any thing happened, as a convention being called, we cannot tell for their wickedness. 
GIBBS 3996 Repeat that answer
BROOMHEAD 3997 Had there been a convention, those societies that sent them, I suppose, would have put confidence in them, and in their consultations, supposing them to be competent to devise and dircct the means to the end for a parliamentary reform—I understand it in that light. 
GIBBS 3998 When that mecting was had, to be sure no moan can answer for the acts of those who should compose it, certainly not ; but had you any reason to suppose, that those whom you should send to that meeting would act otherwise than peaceably ? would youhavesent any who you did not think would have acted peaceably 
BROOMHEAD 3999 No; those would have acted peaceably that we should have sent; we should have sent none else but such. 
GIBBS 4000 And you have no reason to think that others would have acted otherwise than peaceably ? No;Ihave no reason to think so whatever, 
GIBBS 4001 When national representation was talked of by Mr. Yorke at this meeting, by national representation, was jt not meant the representation of the people of England in the House of Commons 
BROOMHEAD 4002 I always understood it 50 for my part. 
GARROW 4003 I could wish to ascertain whether I have taken you correctly; you meant, and as far as you understand, your society meant to produce a reform of the representation of the people in the Commons House of parliament y peaceable means 
BROOMHEAD 4004 Yes. 
GARROW 4005 but you apprehended, that when you should depute your delegates to a convention, that you trusted to that convention, and that what might then be done you could not answer for, not being able to answer for the wickedness of individuals—Did I take you correctly 
BROOMHEAD 4006 Yes. 
GARROW 4007 For the purpose of obtaining this desirable object of a parliamentary reform, you say you corresponded not only with the Constitutional Society, but with other societies ; and among them, you have named a society called, a society of the. Friends of the People 
BROOMHEAD 4008 Yes. 
GARROW 4009 Do you know the answer which that society returned to your’s as early as the 26th of May 
BROOMHEAD 4010 I do not now recollect the answer. 
GARROW 4011 Perhaps I may assist your memory, by reminding you of the reply of your secretary to that society 
BROOMHEAD 4012 Perhaps it might not be me. 
GARROW 4013 Da you know a person of the name of Ashton
BROOMHEAD 4014 Yes. Did he ever act as secretary to your society ?—Yes. 
GARROW 4015 You have said that your object, and, as far as you know, theobject of your society, was, to obtain a reform by peaceable means, and by enlightening the public—I ask you, if you do not know, that upon the society of the Friends of the People returning some answer to your society, that your society wrote, by means of Ashton, your secretary, disclaiming any farther communication with the society of the Friends of the People, as unfit for your purpose 
BROOMHEAD 4016 That he mightdo—thisI cannot say; but I do not know of a certainty that he did; because great part of the time when he was secretary, I had no concern with the society. 
GARROW 4017 Was the measure ofdiscarding this society of the Friends of the People, as unfit for your purposes, discussed in your committees 
BROOMHEAD 4018 I do not recollect its being discussed in a committee. 
GARROW 4019 Was it discussed in any mecting of the divisions 
BROOMHEAD 4020 Not in those meetings of the divisions I have been speakingof, 
GARROW 4021 Wasit in any meetings 
BROOMHEAD 4022 Yes, it may have been—I do not recollect that it was. 
GARROW 4023 That answer won’t suit me—I ask, whether in any meetings of your society, the propriety of having nothing farther to do with this society, the Friends of the People, because they would not go the lengths that made them fit for your communication, was ever discussed
BROOMHEAD 4024 TJhat was discussed. 
GARROW 4025 Was the result of that discussion commun cated to your associated society, the Constitutional Society, that this society, the Friends ofthe People, whatever they professed to do, were not'fit persons for your having any thing more to do with them 
BROOMHEAD 4026 I[ do not know that such a letter was communicated, nor such a letter received. 
GARROW 4027 Idonot ask you, whether you know that such a letter was received, or whether you know that such a letter was sent; but I ask you, if the result of your deliberation was not, that they were unfit for your society, thatthe Constitutional Society might be so informed 
BROOMHEAD 4028 Nay, I am not certain that it was the result of the determination of that meeting; I rather think that it was determined afterwards, if it was determined at all. 
GARROW 4029 Do yourecollect whether Mr. Yorke took any part in that discussion 
BROOMHEAD 4030 No, he was not there then. 
GARROW 4031 Who were the parties 
BROOMHEAD 4032 Several persons spoke, among whom I was one. 
GARROW 4033 Have you read the declarations published by that society, called the Friends of the People : doubtless you have, for your information; or if you have not read them yourself, have they been read in your society 
BROOMHEAD 4034 I might have read them. I will not say. I believe I might. 
GARROW 4035 Do you not know that in language, to which to be sure I can do no justice, they declared their firm intention, by all constitutional and proper means, to produce that very thing which you state to have been your object, a reform in the representation of the Commons House of parliament 
BROOMHEAD 4036 Great numbers of people did not believe them, they did not believe them to be honest. 
GARROW 4037 However, they had made those professions 
BROOMHEAD 4038 Yes; there was something of that. 
GARROW 4039 But that you did not quite believe. Was this, think you, as early asthe 26th of May, 1792, that you disclaimed these Friends of the People 
BROOMHEAD 4040 It may, I do not recollect the time exactly ; I think it might be about that time. 
GARROW 4041 And that was long before Mr. Yorke came among you upon his last mission 
BROOMHEAD 4042 It was.And of course long before all these discussions. Be so good as to tell mea little more distinctly what this mischievous hand-bill was that excited you to arms—I believe it was calling upon people to associate, and to arm against foreign invaders and domestic enemies ?—Yes; but not with any magistrate’s hame to it. 
GARROW 4043 But the object was calling upon the people of Sheffield to arm against foreign invaders and domestic enemies
BROOMHEAD 4044  Yes; and that meeting, when arms were spoken of, it was determined, in several resolutions, to get those ams for the same purpose, in reply to that. 
GARROW 4045 Tet us see that we quite understand one another, Did you adopt that hand-bill, and arm in consequence of it, or were you alarmed atits being prodigiously unconstitutional, and arm against it 
BROOMHEAD 4046 I never did. 
GARROW 4047 But the society 
BROOMHEAD 4048 Some few might, 
GARROW 4049 Was thatto arm against the invasion of foreign enemies, or protect yourselves against attack from domestic enemies
BROOMHEAD 4050 It was couched in words, which were taken and put into resolves, and advertised in Gale’s paper the next week. 
GARROW 4051 Your society, after this hand-bill, calling upon people to arm against foreign invaders and domestic enemies, took that hand-bill as their text, commenting upon it, adopting their resolution, and arming themselves
BROOMHEAD 4052 Y es, against foreign invaders and domestic enemies. 
GARROW 4053 Your reason for doing this was, that you were afraid of illegal force being used against you, as had been done at Manchester and at Birmingham. Did you apply to any magistrate for protection 
BROOMHEAD 4054 It was needless till the injury was done. 
GARROW 4055 Give me the facts first, and the comment afterwards. Did you apply to any magistrate informing him, that you, who were peaceable persons, had been threatened with attacks, and wanted the protection of the civil power
BROOMHEAD 4056 No; why should we till we were attacked? 
GARROW 4057 Tam not capable of arguing with you; I say that unaffectedly. Did you apply to any magistrate, informing him, that any peaceable persons had been threatened with attacks, and wanted the protection of the civil power
BROOMHEAD 4058 No, not to my knowledge. 
GARROW 4059 But, on the contrary, you published resolutions for arming 
BROOMHEAD 4060 To that purpose, couched in their words. 
GARROW 4061 You had no intention at all of altering the overnment, but of applying to the House of Ee crus to redress the grievances, under which the people suffered 
BROOMHEAD 4062 I always understood it in that light. 
GARROW 4063 How early was it that you came to resolutions in your society to petition the House of Commons no more; for that these 558 persons were too fine gentlemen for you; and you were not used to the cuurtly language that would suit their ears 
BROOMHEAD 4064 These were drawn up by Gale and Yorke, and therefore they were winked at out of complaisance to them. 
GARROW 4065 And you, who were too rough for the House of Commons, were courtly enough to i? these resolutions which were proposed y Yorke and Gale, two of the active meimbers of the society, You say the society winked at them 
BROOMHEAD 4066 I suppose they did, knowing them to be of superior knowledge. 
GARROW 4067 However, pass them you did
BROOMHEAD 4068 Yes, be. lieving them to be of superior knowledge to ourselves. 
GARROW 4069 The next step was to form a convention, and by the delegates to procure a full, fair, and equal representation by means of the convention 
BROOMHEAD 4070 There was then at that very time 3 petition to the king. 
GARROW 4071 About the slave-trade 
BROOMHEAD 4072 Yes, and about a reform too. 
GARROW 4073 Whether this was a part of these resolutions which passed upon the subject of arming seo That the landing of Hessian troops in this country, a ferocious and unprincipled horde of butchers, without consent of parlia
GARROW 4074 “ FAST DAY, as observed at SHEFFIELD. 
GARROW 4075 ment, has a suspicious and alarming appear-“ A Serious Lecture, delivered at Snxrriety, ance, is contrary to the spirit of our constitution, and deserving of the marked indignation of every Englishman Was that one of the resolutions that you passed at the time of adopting the resolution about thehand-bill 
BROOMHEAD 4076 I hat was passed when the lecture was read. 
GARROW 4077 Was that long after the hand-bill
BROOMHEAD 4078 No ; long before. 
GARROW 4079 hat it is high time to be upon our guard, since these armed monsters may in a moment be let loose upon us, and pesboularty as the erection of barracks throughout the kingdom may only have been an introductory measure to the filling them with foreign mercenaries —Was that one of the resolutions you passed long before the hand-bill Sometime before ; I do not know exactly how long. 
GARROW 4080 Be so good as to tell me, as you were toarm at Sheffield, very properly as I agree with you, for the sake of preventing attacks upon you, whether you communicated to any other parts of the kingdom the sort of instruments with which you meant to arm yourselves, and your plan of arming
BROOMHEAD 4081 I never did; and I do not know whether any body else did or no. 
GARROW 4082 Do you mean to say, that you do not now know that your society communicated plans for arming, the mode of procuring the instruments, and the models of the weapons 
BROOMHEAD 4083 I never knew a syllable of that till I was informed of it before the privy council. 
GARROW 4084 Then if Davison, in the name of the society, sent any such letter to London, you were not in that secret 
BROOMHEAD 4085 I was not. 
GARROW 4086 You know Davison very well
BROOMHEAD 4087 Yes, I knew him some little time. 
GARROW 4088 He was a member of the society 
BROOMHEAD 4089 Yes, I suppose he was. 
GARROW 4090 You have told me, there was no man at Shefficld mad enough to think of altering the percronient by force at all. Do you include avison in the number 
BROOMHEAD 4091 Well, but at the same time, there may be wicked men among all bodies. 
GARROW 4092 Doubtless there may. Do you include Davison in the number of those who you say are uot to be found in Sheffield, with any bad intention against his majesty, or the government of the country 
BROOMHEAD 4093 I will say this, he did it without the knowledge of the society, and that he did it without my knowledge. 
GARROW 4094 That is not an answer to my question
BROOMHEAD 4095 I have not a doubt of that being proved; but how can I speak to it when I did not know it? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4096 While we wait for the next witness, we will read that part of the aper called the “ Fast Day, as observed at heffield, which relates to the landing the Hessian troops—This was in the year 1794. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4097 The following Extracts were read from a printed Pamphlet, intituled,God, iti a 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4098 Feb. 28th, 1794, being the Day appointed for a Genera Fast: to which are addeda Hy, and Reso utions. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4099 From the beginning to page 3.] “ FAST DAY. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4100  A Royal Proclamation having been issued, commanding February the 28th, 1794, tole observed asa General Fast, the Friends of Peace and Rerors, in Sheffield, determined to honour the Day in the most distinguished Manner. Accordingly the THOUSANDS of thut Town assembled upon a spacious plain near West-street, Backfields, where the Meeding was opened with ine 3 after whiche Serrous Lecrune, suitable to the Occasion, was read with great Energy to the immenx Concourse go, People, who listened in the most attentive Silence. A Hy«n, prepared for this Solemnity, was then sung in full Chores by the whole Assembly. Immediately after, Recaes Camace being called to the Chair, the following Resolutions were unanimously passed, and the Meeting dissolved in that orderly and peaceable Manner, which so ennently distinguishes the patriotic Inhabitants of Sheffield, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4101 “ A Serious Lecture. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4102 “In every age of the world, the cause of truth has always met with its OppOees, whenever it chanced to clash with the interests of a venal tribe of Kings, Courtiers, Priests, and their accomplices. By reading over the 16th chapter of 1 Kings, we find that this was the case; yet the Almighty was pleased by an act of Omnipotent Power, to overturn the malice and wicked intentions of that infamous tyrant Ahab, and the Satellites who surrounded him: for, in the presence of them all (though it made against them) Truth shone forth with redoubled splendour, and the very judgment which Elijah would probably have met with, had not God been for him, fell on those 2b-‘minable Deceivers of Mankind. I refer you to the chapter itself, and without further itroduction, I shall makea few remarks on the events of that period, as it must be obvious, to every ingenuous mind, that there is a great similarity betwixt the conduct of the rulers of that day, and those of the present: therefore it may be needful to observe, ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4103 “ First, Baal’s pee could not possibly succeed, because he to whom they prayed could not help them. Baal, being a name given to an Heathen God, who had no gxise ence except in the imagination of his devotees. And adly, They had a bad cause in band, therefore, were not likely to prevail; no motives to induce them but pride; no appetites to serve, but what were sensual and devilish, so that if they had offered sacrifice to the true tad cause, they would not have ob ro tained their end—for ‘ the ears of the Lord arenot open to the cries of the foolish, but unto 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4104 I. “the wise.’ 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4105 4 “It isin this point of light, I view, with concern, a combination of Kings apparently leagued against the cause of Freedom; a combination which I believe to be odious in the sight of Heaven, although for its support we are commanded a second time from the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4106 Throne, not of God, to fast and pray for the success of our arms over our brethren, who are struggling for every thing that is dear to 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4107 Man, and which is the will of God he should be possessed of Liserry, civil, political, and religious, Life without them is a burden. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4108 “ RESOLUTIONS. RESOLVED UNANIMOUSLY, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4109 “4. That War, the wretched artifice of Courts, is a System of Rapine and Blood, unworthy of rational beings, and utterly repughant to the mild and benevolent principles of the Christian Religion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4110 “a. That if the present war, be a war of Combined Kings against the people of France, to overthrow that Liberty which they are struggling to establish, it is, in our opinion, a war of the most diabolical kind. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4111 “3, That when public Fasts and Humiliations are ordered with the same breath, which commands the shedding of oceans of Human Blood—however they may answer the purposes of State Policy—they are solemn prostitutions of Religion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4112 “4, That the landing of Hessian troops in this country (a ferocious and unprincipled horde of Butchers) without consent of Parliament, has a suspicious and alarming appearance, is contrary to the spirit of our Constitution, and deserving of the marked indignation of every Englishman. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4113 “5. That it is high time to be upon our Guard, since these armed monsters may in a moment be let loose upon us ; particularly, as the erection of barracks throughout the kingdom may only have been an introductory measure to the filling them with Foreign Mercenaries. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4114 «6. That the high and free-born minds of Britons, revolt at the idea of such a Slavish System, and cannot be so far broken, as to kiss the hand which would chain them to its will. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4115 “7. That Peace and Liberty are the offspring of Heaven, and that Life without them is a burden, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4116 “8. That the Thanks of this Meeting are due to Earl Stanhope, for his Motion and spirited Specch for acknowledging the French Republic, and restoring Peace to our distressed country; for his Motions and able Speech in behalf of the persecuted and sufferagg patriots, Messrs. Muir, Palmer, Skirving, and Margarot, in which he nobly stood alone ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4117 and also for the whole of his truly animated and benevolent exertions in support of the injured Rights of the People. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4118 “9. The Thanks of this Meeting are also due to Mr. Sheridan, for his nervous and eloquent Speeches in the cause of injured Patriotism, and in support of the Constitution; and also to every other Member of Parliament who has nobly stood forward at this important crisis, in support of the Constitutional Liberties of Englishmen. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4119 “10. That if any thing had been necessary to have convinced us of the total inefficacy of argument against a Ministerial Majority, the decisions which have lately taken place in Pare liament, would have fully confirmed our opinion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4120 “41, That therefore the People have no remedy for their grievances, but a REFORM IN PARLIAMENT—a measure which we determine never to relinquish, though we follow our Brethren -in the same Glorious Cause to Botany Bay.

ATTORNEYGENERAL 4123 “UNITED ron a REFORM 1s PARLIAMENT. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4124 “ Committee Room, March 20, 1794. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4125 “ RESOLVED, That the Society approve the sentiments contained in the Serious Lecture delivered to the CONSTITUTIONAL SOCIETY at SHEFFIELD, on the 28th of last month—and earnestly recommend it to the perusal of all who think CIVIL and RELIGIOUS LIBERTY a Blessing. Resolved, That the Commanding a General Fast, for the purpose of imploring the Divine Father of Mercy and Peace to support and prosper us in the Aorrid act of deliberately destroying our fellow-creatures, is repugnant to the true spirit and principles of Christianity, where we are commanded to pray for our enemies, &c. And further considering, that a ee. part of the PEOPLE are unacquainted with the nature of the present WAR, either as to its justice or necessity (every endeavour being used to keep them ignorant of the real principles and design for which it was commenced) to approach and to supplicate the Omniscient Power, under such circumstances, and for such a purpose, must indeed be dreadful, since knowledge and conviction are wanting
BROOMHEAD 4126 The worse than hypocritical hearts of those who are the Authors of such a measure—although they at present impose upom the ignorant and credulous, by such detestable, such pretended show of devotion, cannot escape the chastisement of that Power, whom they thus insult, and from whose judgment there is no appeal.

ERSKINE 4223 Where do you live 
ALEXANDER 4224 At the Rose, in the Fleet-market ; I reside there at present. 
ERSKINE 4225 At what time of the year was it that you first went with your friend to this society 
ALEXANDER 4226 Towards the latter end of the year 1793. 
ERSKINE 4227 Did you go for the purpose of being a member 
ALEXANDER 4228 I did not, though I became one. 
ERSKINE 4229 For what purpose did you go
ALEXANDER 4230 I went for the Purpose of going to a club ; my acquaintance asked me if I would go to a society with him, and I went. 
ERSKINE 4231 Who is this friend
ALEXANDER 4232 His name is Whitehorn. 
ERSKINE 4233 You went there perhaps from curiosity 
ALEXANDER 4234 N othing else. 
ERSKINE 4235 Was Mr. Yorke there that night 
ALEXANDER 4236 He was not. 
ERSKINE 4237 Who might be there that first night 
ALEXANDER 4238 Some that were there as delegates; Ashley was there, and Baxter was there; these are all I know by name, except Whitchom. 
ERSKINE 4239 What day of the month was it 
ALEXANDER 4240 I cannot say. ; What day of the week was it ?—Of a Tuesay. In what month ?—I cannot say the month:

ERSKINE 4245 How long did they sit 
ALEXANDER 4246 Till twelve---’till near one o'clock, 
ERSKINE 4247 What did they converse about 
ALEXANDER 4248 They had papers. 
ERSKINE 4249 Were they read
ALEXANDER 4250 I think Mr. Smith had some pamphlet that night to be read ; he generally henoght papers of some kind. 
ERSKINE 4251 Then you heard it read 
ALEXANDER 4252 Yes; there was something read that night. 
ERSKINE 4253 Did you become a member that night 
ALEXANDER 4254 Yes. 
ERSKINE 4255 After you had heard that read 
ALEXANDER 4256 There was nothing read till after I was admitted a member. 
ERSKINE 4257 Then you were suddenly converted into a member; you went there out of mere curiosity, with no design of becoming a member, and at once, when Smith started up, you became a member
ALEXANDER 4258 He asked Whitehorn. 
ERSKINE 4259 And Whitehorn went from curiosity 
ALEXANDER 4260 No, he belonged to them before, to a society in Holborn, which I did not know till afterwards. ‘ 
ERSKINE 4261 When did you go next time
ALEXANDER 4262 I missed’two or three nights. 
ERSKINE 4263 You say you attended seven meetings 
ALEXANDER 4264 I think I attended seven times.

ALEXANDER 4268 I do net recollect—Smith was there. 
ERSKINE 4269 Did not you become acquainted with the people who were there, by conversing with them
ALEXANDER 4270 No; I conversed with Ashley, I spoke to him two or three times. 
ERSKINE 4271 You became a member, because you wished to Propagate their opinions and doctrines 
ALEXANDER 4272 Not at all. 
ERSKINE 4273 Then in plain English you went there as a spy:: did you not 
ALEXANDER 4274 When I went I did not know what it was. 
ERSKINE 4275 When you became a member, did not you become 8 member for the purpose of informing 
ALEXANDER 4276 After I knew what they were I did. 
ERSKINE 4277 ‘ad you had any opinions upon the subjec of a reform ? did you wish a reform of parliament
ALEXANDER 4278 I did not. 
ERSKINE 4279 Then why did you become a member if ou did not wish for a reform in parliament, ut for the purpose of being a spy 
ALEXANDER 4280  When I became a suamiber I did not know what they were. 
ERSKINE 4281 Did you not know they were a society for parliamentary reform 
ALEXANDER 4282 Yes. 
ERSKINE 4283 You say you did not wish a W ironing reform 
ALEXANDER 4284 I scarce knew what they meant by it when they read it over. 
ERSKINE 4285 Did you wish a parliamentary reform when you became a member, when you heard that paper read the first night? Now mind; did you wish a parliamentary reform, or any alteration in the House of Commons or in the government any way ? Upon your oath; look across to the jury. Did you, upon your oath when you became a member of that society wish and desire to have any alteration in any part of the government? You need not look at me, I shall hear it well enough; why do you hesitate; come, cough it up, answer me that upon your oath; are you acquainted with Mr. Dunn, of Manchester
ALEXANDER 4286 No. 
ERSKINE 4287 I should have thought you were? 
EYRE 4288 Why do not you answer the question 
ALEXANDER 4289 I do not understand you. 
ERSKINE 4290 I am sorry for it; I believe you are the only one in court that does not: I will put it again to you, because I wish to be civil to you. Did you wish a parliamentary reform, or any alteration in the government, when you became a member of that society
ALEXANDER 4291 I never wished any thing of the kind. 
ERSKINE 4292 Then upon your oath, why did you become a member of a society for parliamentary reform, if you wished nothing of the kind 
ALEXANDER 4293 The reason of my becomine a member, was, when I went in, as I said before, Smith asked Whitehorne if I would not be made 8 member; he said no, I had better not to-night; but Smith urged him, and said make him a member ; then one got up and read a paper, I heard him read something, but I did not understand what he read till after I got the paper from him; they gave me afterwards what they read-over, and the ticket. 
ERSKINE 4294 Then you read it
ALEXANDER 4295 I do not kuow I read it that night, 
ERSKINE 4296 Did’ you read it before you went there again 
ALEXANDER 4297 Yes I did, 
ERSKINE 4298 Then since you took the paper read in the society home with you, Pati read it in the interval between the first time and the second time of your going there, you must approve of it before you went a second time 
ALEXANDER 4299 I did not. 
ERSKINE 4300 You thought there was danger in it 
ALEXANDER 4301 I read it to two or three of my friends; they were of the same opinion as myself. 
ERSKINE 4302 What is become of the paper
ALEXANDER 4303 I left it at Mr. Dundas’s office. 
ERSKINE 4304 Then you went of course, the second time, for the purpose of becoming an informer
ALEXANDER 4305 I did; 1 went to see what they were upon. 
ERSKINE 4306 Between the first and second time you went to that society, or before you went to it at all, had you been desired by any body to go for that purpose 
ALEXANDER 4307 I had not. 
ERSKINE 4308 Then you went of your own mere motion, because you wished to be serviceable to the pipe by going there
ALEXANDER 4309 The second time I Did. 
ERSKINE 4310 When you were there you pretended to be a friend, no doubt, and to approve of what was going on
ALEXANDER 4311 I did. 
ERSKINE 4312 Whereas in fact you were a spy
ALEXANDER 4313 So I proved at last. 
ERSKINE 4314 You went the second time in order to be one 
ALEXANDER 4315 I went in order to see what their plan was, what the real grounds of it were. 
ERSKINE 4316 Did you take down any minutes on paper
ALEXANDER 4317 They would not suffer it. 
ERSKINE 4318 You went again a third time
ALEXANDER 4319 I did. Was it then that Yorke talked of the pikes?—No. 
ERSKINE 4320 They met weekly, did not they 
ALEXANDER 4321  Every week. 
ERSKINE 4322 That would extend to near two months; then of course you can tell us what month it was in
ALEXANDER 4323 The month I went I cannot say. 
ERSKINE 4324 How long ago; was it in 1793 or 1794
ALEXANDER 4325 I n 1793. 
ERSKINE 4326 Was it winter or summer
ALEXANDER 4327 Towards the latter end of the year. 
ERSKINE 4328 How long before Christmas, think you
ALEXANDER 4329 I cannot say that; I recollect the day when Yorke made his speech, I attended twice after I had been with Mr. Dundas. 
ERSKINE 4330 Should you know the persons if you saw then, that attended this meeting at the end of this year 
ALEXANDER 4331 I cannot say ; I should know Ashley. 
ERSKINE 4332 If you saw the countenances of the same eople that you saw in that room
ALEXANDER 4333 I do not know, I could not swear to them. 
ERSKINE 4334 Were they gencrally the same people, or different: people? — Different people; they came from ditterent divisions. 
ERSKINE 4335 How many people do you mean to swear were in the room that rose up and shook hands with Mr. Yorke, when he stated what you have told the jury about bloodshed and about arms
ALEXANDER 4336 To say exactly I cannot re member ; there might be in the room upwards of sixty, or between that and an hundred; the room was as full as it could hold. 
ERSKINE 4337 I have almost forgot the name of the place
ALEXANDER 4338 A coffee house in Shire-lane, 
ERSKINE 4339 Then they all shook hands with Mr. Yorke, in applause and approbation of what he said
ALEXANDER 4340 Yes, they did when he got up to quit the Toom. 
ERSKINE 4341 Was that when he was going to Bel-gi-um
ALEXANDER 4342 Yes. 
ERSKINE 4343 Was that the word he made use of, that he was going to Bel-gi-um
ALEXANDER 4344 Yes, Beb gi-am or Bel-gi-um. 
ERSKINE 4345 Had you heard of that place before 
ALEXANDER 4346 No, nor did not know what it was. 
ERSKINE 4347 And he said he was: going to head the French army 
ALEXANDER 4348 Yes, he was going to BelSigne to head the French army, and should e back by Christmas; that he had received a letter from a friend of his in Bel-gi-um, thas they would be ripe by Christmas. 
ERSKINE 4349 You did this, no doubt, asa lover of your country mercly 
ALEXANDER 4350 Nothing else. 
ERSKINE 4351 Nothing else but that
ALEXANDER 4352 No other reason. 
ERSKINE 4353 Then you went voluntarily, without ever bemg employed by any body, or desired by any body 
ALEXANDER 4354 There were three of my friends I mentioned it to, who thought I should do right, they said, in giving the information. 
ERSKINE 4355 Who are they 
ALEXANDER 4356 One, his name is Broughton, another isa widow lady, Mrs. Grasswood, and Mr. Bryant. 
ERSKINE 4357 How long have you been in business for yourself

ERSKINE 4361 But not for yourself
ALEXANDER 4362 No. Whom do you live with?—I am not ina situation at present. 
ERSKINE 4363 You are in a very singular situation, I think; what do you mean by not being ina situation

ERSKINE 4386 What sort of business? (look across to the jary)—For the same. 
ERSKINE 4387 mk is a long time in this town, where there is so much linen and callico, to be out of business; whom have you applied to, durin, that time, to be employed
ALEXANDER 4388 I have appli to different people. 
ERSKINE 4389 To whom
ALEXANDER 4390 To Twyman and James, in Holborn. 
ERSKINE 4391 Whom else
ALEXANDER 4392 I applied to another person who has just opened shop; he was going to open shop, Mr. Marley, in Holborn, with him I agreed to live, No. 320, facing Gray’s-innte 
ERSKINE 4393 How happened it you left him 
ALEXANDER 4394 Because I was obligated to attend here. 
ERSKINE 4395 Then you have lost your business by attending here 
ALEXANDER 4396 I have. 
ERSKINE 4397 Then you are a good patriot, indeed! so that from a zeal for the truth, and in order to jane that which you have been proving, you roke off your agreement with this Mr. Marley 
ALEXANDER 4398 Yes. 
ERSKINE 4399 What was he to give you a year 
ALEXANDER 4400 Twentyfive pounds. 
ERSKINE 4401 How long ago is it since you entered into this engagement with him
ALEXANDER 4402 Some time before he opened shop. 
ERSKINE 4403 You know, I do not know when he opened shop; when was that
ALEXANDER 4404 On the twenty-second of last month, I think. 
ERSKINE 4405 How long was it before he opened shop, that you entered into this agreement with him 
ALEXANDER 4406 I cannot say. 
ERSKINE 4407 A day or two days
ALEXANDER 4408 A considerable time before. 
ERSKINE 4409 How long
ALEXANDER 4410 I believe the latter end of July, or the beginning of August. 
ERSKINE 4411 Soyou entered into an agreement with him; when did you go to tell him that you could not goon with this agreement 
ALEXANDER 4412 I told him. 
ERSKINE 4413 How long ago 
ALEXANDER 4414 I told him the day after I had the subpeena that I must leave him. 
ERSKINE 4415 How long ago is it that you had the subpeena 
ALEXANDER 4416 I had the subpeena last Tuesday fortmig Who subpeena’d you?—Mr. Wood. 
ERSKINE 4417 Were you told it was necessary that you should give up your employment for that 
ALEXANDER 4418 N o. 
ERSKINE 4419 Did you ask, whether they would ‘allow you to continue with this linen-draper, and give ean notice when you should be wanted 
ALEXANDER 4420 I did not. 
ERSKINE 4421 Did you apply to the solicitor of the treasury, or any body engaged in this prosecution, to tell them that you had entered into such an engagement 
ALEXANDER 4422 No. 
ERSKINE 4423 So you gave up your employment voluntarily, because you were wanted here at the Old-Bailey, for half an hour
ALEXANDER 4424 Yes, for ne other reason. 
ERSKINE 4425 Did you ask Mr. Marley whether he would consent to take you as his shopman, and allow you to come here for the purpose of giving evidence 
ALEXANDER 4426 No. 
ERSKINE 4427 Had you an idea that Mr. Marley would have refused to permit you to obey the king’s writ, by coming to give evidence here 
ALEXANDER 4428 For that continuance oF time that I expected it would be. 
ERSKINE 4429 Where is Mr. Marley’s shop 
ALEXANDER 4430 In Holborn. 
ERSKINE 4431 So you mean to swear, that having entered into an engagement with Mr. Marley, to receive 25. a year, you put yourself out of employ without ever asking him, whether your attendance here was consistent with his employment, or asking the solicitor of the treasury, whether he would give you notice when you would be wanted to give evidence 
ALEXANDER 4432 Yes; I only left him last Friday. 
ERSKINE 4433 What reason did you give him
ALEXANDER 4434 I said I was going out of town. 
ERSKINE 4435 Then you do not speak the truth, I suppose, unless when you are upon oath 
ALEXANDER 4436  Yes, Ido. 
ERSKINE 4437 Why then did you tell him you were going out of town 
ALEXANDER 4438 Because I expected to be sent for to Sheffield about Yorke. 
ERSKINE 4439 How could you expect it when you knew that this trial was coming on, and you were subpenaed here
ALEXANDER 4440 I expected to go after, as soon as this was over. 
ERSKINE 4441 What made you suppose you should be called to go down to Sheffield as soon as this. trial was over 
ALEXANDER 4442 I only surmised that in my own imagination. 
ERSKINE 4443 Mad any body told you you were to be employed upon that business, after you had been here upon this job 
ALEXANDER 4444 No. 
ERSKINE 4445 Then what made you think you were to go down to Sheffield after Mr. Yorke 
ALEXANDER 4446 Look at the jury, do not look so much at me, I have seen enough of you.—The reason of my thinking so was, I had been informed before, that he was expected to have been tried at the last assizes at York. 
ERSKINE 4447 “Who informed you so
ALEXANDER 4448 Mr. Wood. 
ERSKINE 4449 You told me a little while ago you did not know you were to go down; it was only a surmise of your own mind
ALEXANDER 4450 Immediately after this was over. 
ERSKINE 4451 You have not sought out for any employment since, have you 
ALEXANDER 4452  No. 
ERSKINE 4453 Where did you live before you lived with this Mr. Kellerby
ALEXANDER 4454 At Mr. Faulder’s. 
ERSKINE 4455 Where before that
ALEXANDER 4456 In Cheapside, with Mr. Smith. 
ERSKINE 4457 How long is that ago
ALEXANDER 4458 That is between four and five years ago. 
ERSKINE 4459 How Jong did you live with Mr. Smith, in Cheapside
ALEXANDER 4460 I was with him eighteen months, I believe. 
ERSKINE 4461 “ And left him five years ago
ALEXANDER 4462 I do not know that that is exactly the time. I left him, and went in the country for eleven months. 
ERSKINE 4463 For your health, I suppose 
ALEXANDER 4464 I went to see my friends. 
ERSKINE 4465 Where do they live 
ALEXANDER 4466 At Washford, near Salisbury, six miles from Salisbury. 
ERSKINE 4467 Who are your friends you went to see there
ALEXANDER 4468 My aunt. 
ERSKINE 4469 Whatis her name 
ALEXANDER 4470 Alexander. 
ERSKINE 4471 How long did you stay with her
ALEXANDER 4472 I was there eleven months. 
ERSKINE 4473 That is eleven months out of five years, when you paid your affectionate respects to your aunt. What did you do when you came pack? Where did you go next
ALEXANDER 4474 To Mr. Marley’s. 
ERSKINE 4475 That cannot be, you know; for that is five years ago 
ALEXANDER 4476 I went from Smith’s to Faulder’s. 
ERSKINE 4477 You know it is five years ago
ALEXANDER 4478 It is rather better than four, I believe. 
ERSKINE 4479 You lived eighteen months with Mr. Smith; you went to your aunt’s, and staid eleven months; when you came back, after having paid this visit, and after you had lett Smith, where did you live before you went to Faulder’s 
ALEXANDER 4480 I was with anauntin Old Bedlam. 
ERSKINE 4481 Another aunt
ALEXANDER 4482 Yes. 
ERSKINE 4483 Where is Old Bedlam 
ALEXANDER 4484 On the other side Moorfields. 
ERSKINE 4485 Is her name Alexander 
ALEXANDER 4486 No, Simpson. 
ERSKINE 4487 How mg did you live with her
ALEXANDER 4488 It is impossible for me to say exactly how long it was. 
ERSKINE 4489 Did you live there up to the time; for if you do not tell me that, I shall ask you where you did live—did you live with your aunt in Old Bedlam after you came out of the country up to the time you went to Faulder’s? I do not want to hurry you
ALEXANDER 4490 I went to Smith’s when I retumed from the country; from Smith’s I 
ERSKINE 4491 went to my aunt’s, in Old Bedlam, and was there till 1 went to Faulder’s. 
ERSKINE 4492 I am thrown out quite; you have changed the whole thing upon me at once—when you write your life youmust be alittle more correct, I will just take it down—how long is it ago since you lived with Smith 
ALEXANDER 4493 Rather better than four years; but I cannot be certain. 
ERSKINE 4494 What did you leave Smith for
ALEXANDER 4495 We had some words. 
ERSKINE 4496 Had some words—what might the words be, think you
ALEXANDER 4497 I do not know I am sure exactly now; we had some words, and upon that account we parted. 
ERSKINE 4498 You have an amazing good memory; you have repeated a whole speech a man made at a meeting; but you cannot remember the few words that passed between qo and your master, now try; I will sit down and give you time. 
EYRE 4499 Why do not you give an answer 
ALEXANDER 4500 I cannot recollect the words, it is so long ago. 
ERSKINE 4501 Then you do not remember the words 
ALEXANDER 4502 I do not. 
ERSKINE 4503 When you have words with a man, it means you had a quarrel—You know I did not ask ya what you said to your master, and what e said to you; but what was the quarrel about—You must have a strange memory for a witness—who is to repeat a whole speech, if you do not remember for what you left your master—I wish you would look at those gentlemen ; they are very good looking-men. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4504 Mr. Erskine has said repeatedly, that this witness had represented that he stated the whole speech that Mr. Yorke made—I say, that is not only not correct, but it is very far from correctness. 
ERSKINE 4505 I am exceedingly glad to be corrected, and I shall esteem it no ioterruption whenever you do; because I am so used to this work that nothing can put me out—Do try and recollect what was the nature of the quarrel between you and Mr. Smith. 
EYRE 4506 Do you recollect, and if you do, have you any objection to telling us 
ALEXANDER 4507 No. 
EYRE 4508 Then do you recollect what you quarrelled with Mr. Smith about? 
ERSKINE 4509 I am entitled to have the benefit of this gentleman’s deportment, If your lordship will just indulge me for one moment. ! 
EYRE 4510 Give him fair play. 
ERSKINE 4511 He has certainly had fair play. I wish we had as fair play; but that is not addressed to the Court. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4512 But whom do you mean? 
ERSKINE 4513 I say the prisoner has aright to fair play. 
GARROW 4514 But you said it was not said to the Court. 
ERSKINE 4515 But I am not to be called to order by the bar—Do youordo you not recollect what was the cause of your quarrel with your master 
ALEXANDER 4516 Some words that happened between the shopman and me. We had words first, and then my master and I had some words on account of it, and then we parted. 
ERSKINE 4517 What was the nature of the quarrel between you and the shopman, which led to the quarrel between you and your master ; because now you see you begin to recollect it 
ALEXANDER 4518 We had some high words and he called me, I said I would not be put upon. 
ERSKINE 4519 People seldom begin to abuse one another without some reason 
ALEXANDER 4520 We had words—I was hot as well as him, I suppose—We called one another fools, I do not know whether we did not strike one another—he wanted to be head—I said I would not put up with it. 
ERSKINE 4521 Who was he 
ALEXANDER 4522 His name is Williams. 
ERSKINE 4523 What is his Christian name
ALEXANDER 4524 I do not recollect. 
ERSKINE 4525 his credit, or, as may be said in many cases, his temper; by which a plain and honest witness may be often confounded, and an irritable one led into indiscretions as unbecoming the Court as injurious to the cause of truth and of justice. Fair and honest witnesses
ALEXANDER 4526 those who, to use the language of the Imperial Rescript, ‘ simpliciter visi sint dicere, qui non unum eundemque meditatum sermonem attulerint, sed ad ea que interro“ gaveras, extempore verisimilia resfonde‘ rint,’ are entitled to the fullest protection of the law, and ungt not by the ingenuity of a pleader to be led into perplexitics and seeming contradictions, The state of society in our neighbouring country.—the description of those who often appear there as witnesses in the trial of crimes, the greater frequency of false accusations, and sometimes of vexatious prosecutions, and the rule of evidence that the testimony of one witmess may in certain cases be sufficient to convict ; all account for, and perhaps render necessary, a mode of examination which has hitherto been little known in Scotland. 
ERSKINE 4527 “ Itis this dicence in the English mode of cross-examination that has given rise to a doubt with some late writers on the English law, whether examinations in open court are in every instance preferable to private examinations, taken down in writing. See Evans’s Appendix to Pothier’s Treatise on Obligations, p. 236. Burnett on the Criminal Peake's Law of Evidence, ch. 3, s. 3, pp. 143 
ERSKINE 4528 Do you know where he went to afterwards
ALEXANDER 4529 I do not. 
ERSKINE 4530 Have you ever seen Mr. Smith since you parted from him 
ALEXANDER 4531 Yes, once. 
ERSKINE 4532 From Mr. Smith’s did you go to your aunt? You told me before that you had gone to your aunt’s, and returned from near Salisbury to Mr.Smith’s
ALEXANDER 4533 I went to Mr. Smith’s after returning from Salisbury ; then I went to my aunt’s in Old Bethlem; there I was till I went to Mr. Faulder’s. 
ERSKINE 4534 You are sure it was in the latter end of the year 1793, that you heard all this about pikes 
ALEXANDER 4535 Yes. 
ERSKINE 4536 What did you hear at the third meeting you went to
ALEXANDER 4537 I cannot say. I took no particular notice of any thing that I heard but that night. 
ERSKINE 4538 How long did you stay the third time
ALEXANDER 4539 I ill between eleven and twelve o'clock. 
ERSKINE 4540 At what time did you go in the evening 
ALEXANDER 4541 About eight, between eight and nine. 
ERSKINE 4542 And staid till between eleven and twelve. —Yes. 
ERSKINE 4543 Do you recollect any thing said that third night 
ALEXANDER 4544 I won’t pretend to say I do any night, except that time that York made his specch ; that I can recollect particularly—various things were read over at different times. 
ERSKINE 4545 What were you doing between the hours of eight and twelve at night
ALEXANDER 4546 Sitting there; they kept the books open, and they admitted members, till nine o’clock, I think it was. 
ERSKINE 4547 How many members were admitted that night 
ALEXANDER 4548 I cannot say. 
ERSKINE 4549 ut there were some members admitted 
ALEXANDER 4550 I do not know whether any members were admitted that night—there was in general, of nights; but the books were cep open for admission of them till nine o’clock. 
ERSKINE 4551 But I take for granted, that a great deal must be said between eight and nine, and eleven and twelve; because you know you went there in order to inform 
ALEXANDER 4552 I went there to hear what they had to say. 
ERSKINE 4553 In order to inform, you have told us before —Then did you hear nothing at all
ALEXANDER 4554 I took no particular notice of any thing. 
ERSKINE 4555 You went the fourth night, did you
ALEXANDER 4556 Yes. 
ERSKINE 4557 What time in the evening did you go the fourth night 
ALEXANDER 4558 I suppose about the same time. 
ERSKINE 4559 And since you went in order to collect information, you staid, I suppose, till the party broke up. What was said that night 
ALEXANDER 4560 I do not recollect any thing in particular. 
ERSKINE 4561 Not a syllable
ALEXANDER 4562  do not recollect any thing at all. 
ERSKINE 4563 What time did you go the fifth night
ALEXANDER 4564 About the same time, I suppose. 
ERSKINE 4565 And staid, of course, till it broke up 
ALEXANDER 4566 Yes. 
ERSKINE 4567 Can ‘you recollect nothing that passed that fifth night 
ALEXANDER 4568 I cannot recollect to say in particular what nights they were?—I think I saw Mr. Yorke three times there, he came in with another person, he said they had becn to Newgate to Mr. Frost, and that he was to be pilloried the next day, he said he had had some words with Mr. Kirby. 
ERSKINE 4569 What did you hear said that night by Yorke about the pikes
ALEXANDER 4570 I never heard Yorke mention about the pikes that I know of; it was a person in the room, I do not think Yorke was there the night the pikes were mentioned; it was a person came in from Sheffield, and said, they could get pikes at sixpence a-piece from Sheffield; another said, he thought it would do for them as well as for the people of Sheffield, and it was only living upon bread and cheese for one day. 
ERSKINE 4571 So that is all that you can remember in all the times that you attended 
ALEXANDER 4572 I remember hearing Yorke speak another time about the army's being deteated, and their having mopsticks to defend Frost while he was plored. Was this on the seventh night?—I cannot say. 
BOWER 4573 Were you at any time a member of the London Corresponding Society 
ALEXANDER 4574 I was. 
BOWER 4575 At what time did you Legis to be a member 
ALEXANDER 4576 The same evening as the witness that was last examined, 
BOWER 4577 About what time of the year—the beginning, the middle, or the end 
ALEXANDER 4578 Towards the latter end of the year. 
BOWER 4579 What is your profession 
ALEXANDER 4580 I am shopman to a bookseller. 
BOWER 4581 The first time you were there was with the las witness, Alexander 
ALEXANDER 4582 It was. 
BOWER 4583 Ly you know how Alexander came to go there 
ALEXANDER 4584 I believe we went together. 
BOWER 4585 Did Alexander propose it to you, or you to him
ALEXANDER 4586 I cannot say; but we both went the same evening, I believe. 
BOWER 4587 te you both admitted the same night 
ALEXANDER 4588 Yes. 
BOWER 4589 How long didyou continue a member 
ALEXANDER 4590 I believe we paid for a quarter that evening—I was there, to the best of my knowledge, about four or five times. 
BOWER 4591 Did you see Mr. Yorke there at any of the times 
ALEXANDER 4592 Only once, to the best of my knowledge. 
BOWER 4593 How long did you continue a member after the night you had seen Mr. Yorke there
ALEXANDER 4594 I was not there above once or twice after that. 
BOWER 4595 Have you quitted the society 
ALEXANDER 4596 Yes. 
BOWER 4597 How came you to quit it
ALEXANDER 4598 I could not conveniently attend—I left my situation—I did not know any partic ular reason. 
BOWER 4599 You remember Mr. Yorke being there 
ALEXANDER 4600 I do particularly. 
BOWER 4601 Were there few or many people in the room at that time
ALEXANDER 4602 There might be from forty to sixty people. 
BOWER 4603 Did Mr. Yorke come in as an ordinary member, or distinguish himself in any way 
ALEXANDER 4604 He came in as though he had been thcre bef ore, and seemed to be very well known. 
BOWER 4605 Did he say any thing
ALEXANDER 4606 He made a long speech; I left him speaking, and do not remember any part of his speech, 
BOWER 4607 Do you mean that there might be forty people when you came in, or when you went ra 
ALEXANDER 4608 At each time the room was nearly ull. 
BOWER 4609 Though you do not remember the words of his speech, perhaps you can recollect enough to say, whether it was a moderate or violent speech, or what the subject of it was 
ALEXANDER 4610 He seemed speaking very loud, but I was at the farther end of the room from him. 
BOWER 4611 Cannot you take upon you to recollect even: what the substance of his speech was 
ALEXANDER 4612 No ; not a sentence I could not swear to. 
BOWER 4613 You were there the first night that the other witness went with you
ALEXANDER 4614 I believe it was the first night. 
BOWER 4615 Do you recollect, before you went out of the room, whether any thing was said about Yorke, about his intentions of either being in one place or another, about going abroad, or being at home, or any thing of that kind 
ALEXANDER 4616 I understood something that he was going abroad 
BOWER 4617 From whom
ALEXANDER 4618 I believe he mentioned it in his speech; I did not mind the particular words; or whether I understood it from any body else in the room, I am not certain; but I understood he was about quitting England. 
BOWER 4619 Whom did you live with at the time you became a member of this society 
ALEXANDER 4620 The late Mr. William Owen, in Fleet- street. 
BOWER 4621 Where did you go to after that 
ALEXANDER 4622 To Mr. Baxter’s, a bookseller, No. 81, in the Strand. 
BOWER 4623 Do you recollect enough of the speech that was made by Mr. Yorke on that night, to tell me what impression it made upon your mind at that time ? 
ERSKINE 4624 This cannot possibly be evidence. 
EYRE 4625 He is able to give no account at all of it; and as to any impression upon his mind, certainly youcannot ask him to that. 
BOWER 4626 Had you any conversation with Alexander afterwards about what had passed there 
ALEXANDER 4627 I saw'him a morning or two after we were there; I believe I might ask him how long he staid after I left the room, or something to that purpose. 
BOWER 4628 You say you quitted the society soon after
ALEXANDER 4629 Very soon after; I believe I was not there above four times. 
BOWER 4630 What was your reason for quitting the society 
ALEXANDER 4631 Because I left the situation I was in. 
BOWER 4632 Had you no other reason but that 
ALEXANDER 4633 I lodged at a different part of the town, and had not time if I had a will to go. 
BOWER 4634 Was your reason entirely because you had changed your situation, or had you any other reason besides
ALEXANDER 4635 No;'if I had retained my situation, I should have gone again most likely. 
BOWER 4636 Have you always said that that was your reason? Recollect yourself—I do not know that I have said any thing about it; it was a matter I never thought to be questioned on, and never troubled myself about it, 
BOWER 4637 What part of the room were you in—were you near Mr. Yorke 
ALEXANDER 4638 No, quite the reverse. 
EYRE 4639 How long have you known Alexander
ALEXANDER 4640 Some months; I cannot say how long. 
EYRE 4641 What was his situation 
ALEXANDER 4642 He was in a linen-draper’s shop. 
EYRE 4643 What shop was he in 
ALEXANDER 4644 At the first of my knowledge of him at Faulder’s at Holborn Bridge. 
EYRE 4645 George Widdison sworn

EYRE 4647 You lived at Sheftield, I believe 
ALEXANDER 4648 Yes. 
EYRE 4649 What is your business 
ALEXANDER 4650 A hair-dresser. 
EYRE 4651 Have you any other employ 
ALEXANDER 4652 A turner. 
EYRE 4653 Were you at any time a member of the Constitutional Society at Sheffield 
ALEXANDER 4654 Yes. 
EYRE 4655 About what time did you become a member
ALEXANDER 4656 I do not know exactly ; it is about two years ago, or above that. 
EYRE 4657 Were you at any time a delegate, at any division of that meeting 
ALEXANDER 4658 Yes. 
EYRE 4659 What division of the Sheffield meeting were you a delegate of 
ALEXANDER 4660 We were not separated into divisions at that time ; we were all united, and used to meet at different houses. 
EYRE 4661 When was the separation made; how long after you became a member ; do you recollect at what time you became a delegate 
ALEXANDER 4662 I cannot say. 
EYRE 4663 How many members might there be at that time 
ALEXANDER 4664 Sonie few hundreds, erhaps, 
EYRE 4665 Was the Fountain one of the houses you met at
ALEXANDER 4666 Yes. 
EYRE 4667 Do you remember, at ny time, being there at any meeting of the society 
ALEXANDER 4668 Yes. 
EYRE 4669 How many people might be there at the time 
ALEXANDER 4670 Toe best of my recollection, that was the first time I attended, and there was, perhaps, about two hundred. 
EYRE 4671 And that is about two years ago
ALEXANDER 4672 Better than two years. 
EYRE 4673 How long did you continue a member of that society 
ALEXANDER 4674 About two years. 
EYRE 4675 When you first remember the society, where did they hold their meetings at Sheffield 
ALEXANDER 4676 At that house. 
EYRE 4677 Do you know a person of the name of Yorke 
ALEXANDER 4678 Yes. 
EYRE 4679 Do you know him by any other name 
ALEXANDER 4680 I do not. 
EYRE 4681 When did you first see Mr. Yorke; about what time
ALEXANDER 4682 About a twelve-month ago, I believe. 
EYRE 4683 Where was it
ALEXANDER 4684 I cannot tell exactly the pes I saw him at; either at Mr. Gale’s, or Ir. Mavshall’s, 
EYRE 4685 Did you ever see him, at any time after, at any of the meetings of the Constitutional Society 
ALEXANDER 4686 Yes; several. Do you recollect at any time, whether Mr. Yorke took an active part; who was chairman ?—He was. gencrally chairman when be was there. 
EYRE 4687 Was he often there 
ALEXANDER 4688 I have seen him at about three or four different mectings. 
EYRE 4689 About what time, as near as you can recollect, did you see him
ALEXANDER 4690 TI saw him at one meeting in Queen-street. 
EYRE 4691 When was that 
ALEXANDER 4692 It was not long after the execution of the king of France. 
EYRE 4693 When did you see him at any other meeting
ALEXANDER 4694 I saw him at another meeting, at the sign of the Barrel. 
EYRE 4695 Tow long was that meeting, do you recollect, after the former 
ALEXANDER 4696 I cannot recollect. 
EYRE 4697 Do you recollect any thing particular in Mr. Yorke’s conduct and speech, when saw him atthe Barrel
ALEXANDER 4698 I do not recollect any thing particular in his speech; he appeared to me to be rather in liquor, at the time he was there. 
EYRE 4699 Do you remember seeing him, at any time after that, ata meeting in the open air
ALEXANDER 4700  eae I saw him at the meeting at the Castleill. 
EYRE 4701 That was about the beginning of November last; was it not 
ALEXANDER 4702 No; April. 
EYRE 4703 What was done at that meeting
ALEXANDER 4704 That was the meeting that the pamphlet you have been reading was proceeded upon. 
EYRE 4705 Were you there when any delegate was elected 
ALEXANDER 4706 I have been there when there have been delegates elected. 
EYRE 4707 I mean a delegate to the Scotch Convention 
ALEXANDER 4708 Oh! I was there. 
EYRE 4709 When was that
ALEXANDER 4710 I do not recollect the time; 1 suppose it is a twelve-month ago nearly. 
EYRE 4711 Who was the delegate
ALEXANDER 4712 Matthew Campbell Brown. 
EYRE 4713 What was he
ALEXANDER 4714 He is an attorney by profession, I believe.

ALEXANDER 4716 Yes, he was; but some little time before that he used to act as a player.

EYRE 4721 In what month
ALEXANDER 4722 I think the first time that I saw him was the latter end of March, or beginning of April. 
EYRE 4723 Did you attend upon him 
ALEXANDER 4724 I was employed as hair-dresser to him,

EYRE 4727 Had you an opportunity, when you were about Mr. Yorke, to know what he was doing; whether writing any thing ; or what he was about
ALEXANDER 4728 I do not know in particular what he was about. 
EYRE 4729 Did you learn, during the time you attended Mr. Yorke there, whether any address, or any thing was going forward that he had any share in
ALEXANDER 4730 I cannot say I did; I saw an address afterwards that was said to be wrote by him.

I asked you, before, whether any of those members, except Franklow that you knew, were inhabitants of the parish of al a said not 
ALEXANDER 4763 Not to my knowe, : i id you know any of them ?—I knew that some of them were not. 
ERSKINE 4764 How came e's house, in Turnstile, Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields, to be a ae fixed upon for exercising the members of the Loyal Lambeth Association, who were not to go beyond the bounds of their own parish 
ALEXANDER 4765 I can tell no otherwise, only, that they could not any place else. It was thought proper, ey Franklow, and some others, that as they could not get members fast enough, that the association should be divided into ten divisions ; one division to be up at Spence’e—another at John Shelmerdine’s another in Westtainster, at Williamson’s; where the others were to be I do not know. 
ERSKINE 4766 Had you, at the time that you were supplying arms to this society, any conversations with them upon the subject of parliamentary reform: or did you hear any conversation among them respecting that 
ALEXANDER 4767 Yes ; there was conversation of that kind passed between them, more times than once, at the times ofnot. 
ERSKINE 4768 their meetings. 
ERSKINE 4769 What was the subject of those conversations, or did those conversations respect at al! the end of their association
ALEXANDER 4770 I cannot tell; I never minuted any thing down. 
ERSKINE 4771 Can you tell the substance of any conversa tian they had upon the subject of parliementary reform
ALEXANDER 4772 I can go no further than this, that I could coltect so far es this, that if they could not get a reform of parliamert without it, they would endeavour to have got it by the force of arms. ; om 
ERSKINE 4773 I ask you from the conversation of the members of that association that met. 
GIBBS 4774 I object to this—I understand the Court has determined that any thing that any member of the Corresponding Society says, is evidence against Mr. Hardy: but I do bot apprehend that the Ceurt has determined that every thing said by the members of the Lambeth Association, whom the witness does not know to be members of the Corresponding Society is evidence; consequently the question put, of what this man has heard from any member of the Lambeth Association, um ee oon Sex tte he Beare sca some of se who compose Fre} ing Soci insceenaeice, aiid 
BOWER 4775 I understood you, that Hardy gave you the address of Franklow !—Yes; he gave me his card. 
BOWER 4776 Ta consequence of which you went Franklow’s, and there met this society 
ALEXANDER 4777 Yes. 
BOWER 4778 I conceive when I prove that a number of persons assemble together, under the directions of the prisoner, that I can give evidence of their conversation.: 
EYRE 4779 The moment you have proved one of the terms of your proposition you are right ; at the mement it is that this association of Franklow’s was under the eckenes gel apnea undoubtedty ever’ ing t wi evidence against the: oa . meh I do not observe that the evidence g goes farther than this—in the course of trade Williams buying shoes and boots of Hardy, Hardy recommends him to Franklow, in'the way of his business, and there is no: thing that I can discover, at present, to coonect Franklow’s transaction, with r to this association, with Hardy, except so far as the: members of it, can be traced to be members of the London Corresponding Society : you have examined with a view to that, and it appeared to me that that examination rather failed, for he did not undertake to know that any of those people were members of that society. wt 
BOWER 4780 I will see if I can get the facts a hittle more distinctly—was Franklow a meow ber of the London Corresponding Society
ALEXANDER 4781 H e was. Did you know Shelmerdine ?—Yes. Was he a member?—He was. De you know John Williamson?—Yes; but T cannot say whether he was a member or 
BOWER 4782 Do you know James Davison
ALEXANDER 4783 I never saw him but once, 
BOWER 4784 Do you know whether he was a member of the Corresponding Society? —I cannot take upon me to say. 
EYRE 4785 Franklow was a member of the London Corresponding Society —this association undoubtedly was formed by him, it is his creature absolutely ; and therefore that is the ground on which the transaction of that association must be fet in. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 4786 lt has already been proved that at the dinner on the 20th of January, Franklow appeared in the regimentals ef this association. 
GIBBS 4787 He did so: but I do not apprehend that if any gentleman who wears a particular uniform had appeared up stairs at dinner with your lordships to-day, that your lordships would be affected by any thing which a member of the society, to which that gentleman belonged had said. I might put the case of some gentlemen who did dine with your lordships, who are engaged in societies that wear uniforms: suppose one of those gentlemen had happened to dine with your lordships up stairs in that uniform, by the argument the solicitor general uses, because he appeared in his uniform, at dinner with your lordships, therefore, what any one said who belonged to the society, distinguished by that uniform would be evidence against all those who h dined with that gentleman. It seems to me that is an argument which cannot stand for a moment 
GIBBS 4788 Another way in which it has been put by my learned friend, Mr. Bower, is thise—That because Mr. Franklow being a member of the London ‘Corresponding Society, presided at another society, fur a purpose that is not connected with the London Corresponding Society therefore, first his declarations are evidence against Hardy, because he is one of those sands of whom the London Corresponding Society consists; and next, if he constitutes another society consisting of ten thousand men, every thing, that every one of those ten thousand men, who are constituted by one man that belongs to the two or three thousand of which the London Corresponding Society consists, is to be evidence against Mr. Hardy. It does not seem to me that there is any principle of law upon which any of those men who happened to belong to a society, instituted by Franklow, he happening to be a member of the society of which Hardy was a member, that the declarations of any one of those men so sub-connected with the society, no, not even upon oath, can be evidence against Hardy, to prove either that he has compassed the king’s death, or done any of the acts stated in this indictment, or that those acts were. pointed to that design sgainet the king’s life. Perhaps, I am less distinct in arguing the case before your lordship, because, I confess, I do not feel any principle upon which this can be contended to be evidence. 
BOWER 4789 I will prove that none were to be admitted into Franklow’s Association but members of the London Corresponding Society. 
EYRE 4790 Whether the principle will apply to the particular fact is another thing ; butit has been so often stated, that I am surprised we have not had the good fortune to make ourselves understood by the bar, because we have stated from the beginning of this trial, that there was a species of evidence, which was admissible in this case, which had no immediate relation to the prisoner; and that there was another species of evidence which had immediate relation to the prisoner—that inasmuch as the prisuner is charged with being involved in a conspiracy and some evidence being given of his having been so involved, that all the transactions of that conspiracy, to which he is not immediately a party, he will be bound by, if, upon the whole, he has consented to that geteral conspiracy; and that, therefore, all the transactions of a plot are always given in evidence, without regard to the question, whether the prisoner is proved to be concerned in those particular transactions—always with this reserve, that there must be evidence enough against the prisoner to prove him so involved in the plot, as to become seapansibie for all the parts of it—thatseems sufficiently distinct. 
EYRE 4791 But there may be a doubt whether this particular case falls withio the principle. ‘Fhe first question is—whether there is any evidence here of Franklow’s being a member of the London Corresponding Society; if the only proof of that is, that he dined in an un form at their annual dinner, I should have great difficulty about that, because, I under stand, that they were in the habit of receiving visitors as well as entertaining their own members—that being so, a man might be there without being a member of the London Corresponding Society. 
EYRE 4792 Supposing it once proved distinctly that he was a member of the London Corresponding Society, then the question will be, was hea member of the Corresponding Society, who is charged with having a great share in the whole of this transaction—is found to be associating persons together under a pretence not true in fact, of their being inhabitants of Lambeth, and associating forthe defence of the inhabitants of Lambeth; that they are furnished with arms, are learning the manual exercise, and are connected with the society, either by Franklow’s being, or being themselves members of the Corresponding Society. I cannot undertake to say, that that will not connect with the general history of this transaction; and, therefore, there may be room upon that ground to admit the evidence ; but first of all, how is the fact with regard to Franklow being a member? 
GIBBS 4793 I could understand how Franklow’s declarations were evidence, but the point that puzzled me was, I could not understand how the declarations of those men who were only concerned with Franklow in his association, could be evidence, because it seems to me upon the same principle that the declarations of people sub-employed by them, and of others sub-employed by them, and so oa, would be evidence. 
EYRE 4794 Unless the be put exactly in the condition of F; your objection is right. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4795 Was Franklow a can low, member of the Corresponding Society 
ALEXANDER 4796 He was. 
BOWER 4797 W hether, previous to your admission into that society, you had any conversation with the prisoner about the London Corresponding Society, about providing arms for the Lambeth Association 
ALEXANDER 4798 I cannot recollect. 
BOWER 4799 Were you admitted a member of the London Corresponding Society, before you were employed by the Lambeth Association
ALEXANDER 4800 Yes. 
BOWER 4801 How happened you to be admitted a memof the Land Corresponding Society
ALEXANDER 4802 Mr. Hardy told me to meet a young man who would go with me to the division, and I should be admitted, and I was by that means admitted. ’ 
BOWER 4803 Before you were admitted to the Lambeth Association, were you asked at all, whether you were a member of the London Corresponding Society 
ALEXANDER 4804 I do not recollect that I 
BOWER 4805 was. 
BOWER 4806 Did Franklow know that you were
ALEXANDER 4807 I have no reason to think he did not; I believe he did. 
BOWER 4808 Hardy did know it
ALEXANDER 4809 Yes. 
BOWER 4810 From the conversation of the members there associated. 
EYRE 4811 Enquire what the conversation was, because whether he rightly collects the effect of it or not, cannot be known with certainty. 
BOWER 4812 Tell us the substance of any conversation you have heard amongst the members of this society respecting the purposes of this association for a arliauentary reform ? 
GIBBS 4813 It seems to me that it is not open to Mr. Bower to fix the prisoner with what the witness may fancy he has collected froma conversations that he has heard at this society, without mentioning who those persons were from whom he heard it: for how am I to contradict it? 
BOWER 4814 If you ever heard any conversations of the kind, do you recollect any of the members of the society who were present? 
EYRE 4815 You said you understood from conversation amongst them, what they intended to du. Now what were those conversations, and from whom did you hear those conversations
ALEXANDER 4816 I really cannot name the ons; I make no doubt but what Mr. Nodder and Mr. Sanderson themselves might be present, they were members of the same association. 
BOWER 4817 Did you hear any thing from Franklow about a parliamentary reform 
ALEXANDER 4818 I cannot say I recollect any thing that he said particularly ; he was present when such conversation passed. 
BOWER 4819 Were you a member of the Loyal Lambeth Association 
ALEXANDER 4820 No. 
BOWER 4821 Were you ever present with them 
ALEXANDER 4822 No. 
BOWER 4823 Were you ever at Spence’s in Turnstile 
ALEXANDER 4824 I was, : 
BOWER 4825 Were you ever there when any of the Loyat Lambeth Association were there 
ALEXANDER 4826 I cannot tell, for I do not know any thing of any persons of that description. 
BOWER 4827 Were yo ever present at any meeting of the Loyal Lambeth Association
ALEXANDER 4828 None of that description as I know of. 
BOWER 4829 Mr. Bower to Williams.—Did you ever hear any conversation in the presence of Franklow, from-the persons who were present there at that association
ALEXANDER 4830 Yes; I have said so already. 
BOWER 4831 You have, in the presence of Franklow, though you do not know the persons 
ALEXANDER 4832 Yes. 
BOWER 4833 I submit that it is sufficient to let in the evidence. 
GROSE 4834 But let us hear the conversation, Mr. Bower, not what he collected. j 
EYRE 4835 All that can affect Franklow by the general evidence, must be admissible. 
ERSKINE 4836 The Court has ruled frequently in the course of the trial—and it would be indecent in us to argue it again, that any thing said or done by any member of the London Corresponding Society, or any members of any other society with which that society is implicated, will be evidence to prove the first branch of the conspiracy, and that they must go on to build upon that evidence that which is necessary afterwards to affect the prisoner. Therefore I submit to your lordships what I take to be the distinction here--- Mr. Bower was going on to prove that all the members of the Lambeth Association were members of the Corresponding Society, which would put an end to our objection; or supposing they were not all members, if the witness had said that what was done came from a member of the Corresponding Society, then I apprehend it will be evidence also; but your lordship has truly said, that Mr. Hardy does not seem to be more connected with Williams, the serjeant major of this particular body, than merely in the course of trade he asked him if he knew any body that wanted guns, he said he did not; this man made shoes for him; in the course of a fort. night or three weeksafter herecommended him to Franklow, but non constat that at the time he recommended him to Franklow, he knew the articles of his association, he only knew Franklow in his character of a member of the London Corresponding Society; thereforeIconceive it would be going beyond the .rule your lordship has estal lished, for a. man to state what he heard in the presence of Franklow, who might be attending to somethin else, or who might not approve of what was said, and which might have nothing to do with his institution ; it would be too much fo affect the prisoner, particalarly at so late a period of the cause (though I do not mean to say that would make any specific difference) with a declaration so very inconsistent with what your lordship has already heard upon this subject; it therefore seems to me an object of greater suspicion, and more our duty to guard against. The witness has said he cannot specify who the person was, and if they were not all members of the London Corresponding Society, nun constat, that the man was a member of the London Corresponding 
ERSKINE 4837 Society. 
EYRE 4838 Nothing turns upon the question whether Hardy did or not recommendWilliams to Franklow, the ground of its admissibility is simply that Franklow was a member of the London Corresponding Society, then as a ground of the general conSpiracy, it is offered to prove that Franklow has formed an association of armed men, to which, association they will impute a design connected with this alleged conspiracy ; whatever, therefore, will fix Franklow with that, has been considered as proper evidence to shat eral charge; and the only question, therefore is, whether laying, for a moment, the imself at the bar, whether if he makes an association of persons of this description, and if there are convetsations passing in his presence, from: whence a bad design can be imputed to this association, whether that is not admissible evidence as against him? what the effect of the evidence will be, it is truly obseryed, will depend upon a thousand circumstances; whether he was attending, whether if he was attending, he approved or disapproved of it? all which may avoid the effect ef the evidence; still it seems to me that as against Franklow, and to fix upon him the having been. guilty of forming this association fora purpose, the transactions that pass in hie hearing are clearly evidence. 
EYRE 4839 Mr. Bower to Williams.—You told me Mr. Sanderson and Mr. Nodder were present at a conversation that I should have asked you to, if I had been admitted; were they present at Spence’s, Franklow’s, or Shelmerdine’s 
ALEXANDER 4840 I basa only seen them at Shelmerdine’s aad 
BOWER 4841 You are a member of the London Corresponding society 
NODDER 4842 I am. 
BOWER 4843 Were you present at either Spence’s or Shelmerdine’s, and at which, at the time the last witness, bales ns there, and when persons were assembled for the purpose of bedrilled
NODDER 4844 To my knowledge I Cette saw Williams but at Spence’s.

BOWER 4851 Do you know whether’ the persons who were there, were members of the London Corresponding Society or not

EYRE 4856 ‘ranklow. 
ERSKINE 4857 To what was said, but not what he collected. 
EYRE 4858 Not what he collected. 
EYRE 4859 Mr. Bower to Williams.—Tell me any conversation you recollect when Franklow was present respecting the London Corresponding Society 
NODDER 4860 I cannot recollect the conversations. 
EYRE 4861 Can you recollect any part of them; how did you collect it
NODDER 4862 By being with them at various times, and hearing different talk ; there were some among them which I did not take any notice of, or give myself any concern about. 
EYRE 4863 When they met at all, was the subject of parliamentary reform intreduced at all as 2 topic of conversation 
NODDER 4864 No, only some would be talking one to the other. 
EYRE 4865 You meaui it was not pores conversation, not as a debate, ur any thing of that kind
NODDER 4866 No. 
EYRE 4867 But they were talking to each other
NODDER 4868 Yes. 
EYRE 4869 Were they talking so that Franklow beard them 
NODDER 4870 Private persons might talk about it. 
EYRE 4871 We ought to be always very correct when collecting what people said. I think you had better not press it. 
BOWER 4872 Y ou heard from Franklow thet they were to consist of sixty 
NODDER 4873 Yes. 
BOWER 4874 Did you hear from Franklow whether they were to have any more, or that was to be the utmost quantity they were to have
NODDER 4875 That was to be the number. 
BOWER 4876 Had you any directions from Franklow or Hardy upon the subject of arms, or of any other kind 
NODDER 4877 I was one night in Mr. Hardy's shop, and there was a person there asked me tel long I thought Is be to get a thuusand. 
BOWER 4878 Was Mr. Hardy present 
NODDER 4879 He was present; it was a stranger; he asked how long I thought I should be getting a thousand guns ; I told him I could not think of getting so many in the situation that I was in. 
BOWER 4880 What said Hardy to it
NODDER 4881 I do not know that he made any reply. 
BOWER 4882 Was any thing more said 
NODDER 4883 They said they might get a thousand from Sheftield; I said such a thing might be, but I could not undertake any thing of the kind; there as far as I recollect, the conversation ended.

LAW 4904 Do you know of how many persons this armed society consisted? 
EYRE 4905 How many stand of arms did you find there
SANDERSON 4906 I did not take particular notice, there might be seven or eight stand of arms there. 
EYRE 4907 Of how many persons did this armed society consist
SANDERSON 4908 I suppose of twenty-four or twenty-five members. 
EYRE 4909 Whether all the persons of the association were members of the London Corresponding Society
SANDERSON 4910 I suppose they were, because they objected to my being of the armed association because I was not a member of the London Corresponding Society. I was made a member of the armed society upon a promise that I would become a member of the London Corresponding Society. 
EYRE 4911 Did you afterwards become so
SANDERSON 4912 I did. 
EYRE 4913 How many persons have you scen at any one time together at this armed society 
SANDERSON 4914 I think when I first met them at Shelmerdine’s there might be twenty-four or twenty-five: they did not all meet at Shelmerdine’s; we adjourned to another place; it was supposed to be dangerous to meet at Shelmerdine’s; the adjournment had been agreed upon before I came there; the greater part of the arms had been removed. 
EYRE 4915 Who had you to teach yeu the military exercise there 
SANDERSON 4916 We did not exercise there.

SANDERSON 4920 The house was in Worcester-street. 
EYRE 4921 Was the name of the person Day

SANDERSON 4932 I called several times when there were none there; it was the 14th of November, I think, I first of all went; no ; it was on the 11th of April, the first time I went to Spence’s to exetcise; I continued to ga occasionally to Spence’s till May the 1st.

SANDERSON 4944 He was a member of the Corresponding Society; he had served in the French army, from his own account. 
EYRE 4945 You were not at first admitted, but you became afterwards a member of the Corresponding Society 
SANDERSON 4946 I did. 
EYRE 4947 What was the reason that you did not ig afterwards to exercise at Shelmerdine’s
SANDERSON 4948 He was a hatter, and frequently changed his men; and some of them, they observed, might not be staunch to the cause, and therefore it might be hazardous. 
EYRE 4949 rd Chief Justice Eyre.—Hazardous to the cause; to what cause
SANDERSON 4950 IfI might judge from the conversation, it was to obtain a parliamentary reform, at the point of the bayonet. 
EYRE 4951 When you say, the cause, do you mean the cause they were engaged in
SANDERSON 4952 Yes. 
EYRE 4953 You were in au association, and had articles of an association
SANDERSON 4954 I never saw them.

SANDERSON 4964 One of the members got up, and said, citizen|1. 
ERSKINE 4965 Who was the member 
SANDERSON 4966 I do not know.

LAW 4968 Was it a member of the division 
SANDERSON 4969 Yes, at this meeting none were adadmitted but members. 
LAW 4970 What did this member say 
SANDERSON 4971 Citizens, Mr. Pitt will go over—I forget which of the bridges, but he mentioned one of the bridges, at twelve o’clock at night. 
LAW 4972 Did he accompany that with any observation
SANDERSON 4973 None ; there was a general clap upon the table, and some said it was very improper to make any comments upon it. 
LAW 4974 Was any thing farther said, al what bridge 
SANDERSON 4975  They mentioned the particular bridge, and on what occasion-he would be detained tilltwelve o'clock at night; 1 think it was Putney bridge, but do not recollect the bridge to a certainty.

LAW 4988 Do you remember any observation that a member made, respecting any of his relations 
SANDERSON 4989 I do recollect some observations, but cannot recollect the exact words ; but I think he said, if it had been his own father, or his own son, he should be glad, if he met with the same fate. 
LAW 4990 Had who been
SANDERSON 4991 The messenger. 
LAW 4992 Was that man a near relation of any of the king’s messengers

LAW 4996 Was any thing mentioned, by way of caution, to the members, for fear of spies
SANDERSON 4997 It was frequently hinted to the members to be cautious, for fear of spies; to be careful what they said; for, in all divisions of the society, spies from the treasury would creep in. 
LAW 4998 Do you remember any proposition for subdividing the meetings into a less number 
SANDERSON 4999 Yes; it was a proposal, that, as they might be prevented meeting in public houses, on account that their licences might be taken away, that they should be divided into tithings, that they might meet at the House of every tenth man. 
EYRE 5000 Was that your armed society? No; the London Corresfoballig Socie

SANDERSON 5002 It was deferred for further consideration. 
LAW 5003 Was there any mention of any one of the committee being a spy

SANDERSON 5010 From Williams.

SANDERSON 5012 No, I have not. 
ERSKINE 5013  Soa member said, he would not care for blowing any spy's brains out
SANDERSON 5014 Yes. 
ERSKINE 5015 Were not you alittle afraid when you heard that 
SANDERSON 5016 I was., 
ERSKINE 5017 ! you were a spy, were you
SANDERSON 5018 I was, 
ERSKINE 5019 What was that paper you had in your hand, a little while ago
SANDERSON 5020 Merely a memorandum of dates. 
ERSKINE 5021 lam glad you have it; we will go to work with dates; I like a paper of dates; you will be bound by it
SANDERSON 5022 I will be bound by it, upor my oath, as near as a man can be bound toa paper of dates. 
ERSKINE 5023 On what night was it, and at what place, that there wa3a rejoicing, that there was a defeat of the British troops, and when one of the incmbers said, that one of the king’s messengers had been killed ; and, if ithad been his own father, he should have been giad, if he had met with the same fate
SANDERSON 5024 I think it was the 21st. 
ERSKINE 5025 None of your thinking, when you have the paper in your hands !—I have not a memorandum of the date. 
ERSKINE 5026 What date have you taken, good Mr. Spy
SANDERSON 5027 I do not think, upon such an occasion, being a spy is any disgrace. 
EYRE 5028 These observatrons are more proper when you come to address the jury. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5029 Really that is not a proper way to examine witnesses. Lord Holt held strong language to such sort of an address from a counsel to a witness, who avowed himself a spy. 
ERSKINE 5030 I am sure I shall always pay that attention to the Court which is due from me; but I am not to be told by the attorney general, how I am to examine a witness. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5031 I thought you had not heard his lordship. 
ERSKINE 5032 I am much obliged to his lordship for the admonition he gave me, I heard his lordship, and I beard you, which I should not have heard. 
ERSKINE 5033 “What was the date when you say that passed, that there was a defeat of the British troops, and somebody said, that there was a messenger killed in the country, and he should ‘have been glad if it had been his own father
SANDERSON 5034 When first I was introduced into the 13th division, was on the 21st of April, on a Monday. ‘ 
ERSKINE 5035 When was it you heard that conversation, from whence you collected, that the reform of parliament was to be carried at the pvint of the bayonet
SANDERSON 5036 That was mentioned at the armed society. 
ERSKINE 5037 Have you got any date for that
SANDERSON 5038 Yes; I never was there but once, therefore I could noe make an error in that; it was April the 2nd. 
ERSKINE 5039 At what place 
SANDERSON 5040 At Day’s. 
ERSKINE 5041 Where is Day’s
SANDERSON 5042 In the Borough, near the Grove; I believe it is called Worcesterstreet. 
ERSKINE 5043 How many persons were present at that time
SANDERSON 5044 Some were going up stairs, and some going away; to the best of my recollection there might be twenty-two, twenty-three, or twenty-four; I did not count them, as I never expected to be called. 
ERSKINE 5045 You must have expected it
SANDERSON 5046 I had every reason to suppose I should not be called. 
ERSKINE 5047 I wish to know from you, whether, from the conversation that you are now stating, of obtaining a reform of parliament, at the point of the bayonet, whether you collected this from one person, or the general conversation of the whole people
SANDERSON 5048 It seemed to be the opinion of the whole company, that a parliamentary reform could not be obtained, but at the point of the bayonet. 
ERSKINE 5049 And you collected, that it was their intention so to carry it
SANDERSON 5050 Yes; from their general conversation. 
ERSKINE 5051 And you fix that conversation to the 2nd of April, at this place 
SANDERSON 5052 Yes. 
ERSKINE 5053 What was that you said about a bet 
SANDERSON 5054 The reason of my going there was to decide a bet ; that was the way I first came to go there. 
ERSKINE 5055 And you lost your bet 
SANDERSON 5056 I did. 
ERSKINE 5057 You made yourself a member of the Corresponding Society 
SANDERSON 5058 I did. 
ERSKINE 5059 And took those notes
SANDERSON 5060 I did. 
ERSKINE 5061 Why did you take those notes 
SANDERSON 5062 When I once discovered, that an armed society of this sort existed, which I thought of such dangerous tendency, I immediately gave notice to the secretary of state. 
ERSKINE 5063 How long after you had lost your bet 
SANDERSON 5064 Between two and three days; but I mentioned it before that bet was decided, that, if I lost my bet,. should certainly acquaint the se-cretary of state. 
ERSKINE 5065 Should you know the faces of any of those persons
SANDERSON 5066 I should, of two or three of them. 
ERSKINE 5067 Should you know more of them
SANDERSON 5068 I do not think I should; I know the person in the chair, Orr. 
ERSKINE 5069 Was Franklow there 
SANDERSON 5070 He was. 
ERSKINE 5071 Do you know any body else that was there
SANDERSON 5072 I think Williams was there; but I did nut, expect to see sucha thing; I was very much flurried and confused. 
GARROW 5073 Have you been for any time a member of the London Corresponding Society 
SANDERSON 5074 I became a member on the 5th of April, 
GARROW 5075 What April do you speak of 
SANDERSON 5076 April, 1794. 
GARROW 5077 Did you become a member, in consequence of any communication between you and any magistrate of the country 
SANDERSON 5078 I had not been directed to become a member, in consequence of the recommendation of any magistrate ; I had been unexpectedly proposed by Whittam, and a magistrate had told me, if another person had proposed me. I should become a member, : 
GARROW 5079 Had you communicated with any magistrate of the country, before you communicated with the society 
SANDERSON 5080 Not respecting the Corresponding Society. 
GARROW 5081 Who was the person that first introduced you to the society 
SANDERSON 5082 John Hillier. 
GARROW 5083 Did you make application to him first, or he to you
SANDERSON 5084 I first went to Hillier, to make some inquiries respecting a person who was a member of that society. 
GARROW 5085 What led you to go to Ilillier to make that inquiry 
SANDERSON 5086 From seeing publications of that nature, and I was informed that the person respecting whom I was directed to make the inquiry was a member of the Corresponding Society. 
GARROW 5087 Publications of what nature 
SANDERSON 5088 From seeing publications in Hillier’s shop window, which appeared to me to be of a seditious nature. 
GARROW 5089 What business did Hillier carry on 
SANDERSON 5090 He sold pamphlets. 
GARROW 5091 From that you thought it likely he was a member of the society, likely to give you information, there being some man you wanted toinquire about
SANDERSON 5092 Yes. 
GARROW 5093 When did you first make your application to Hillier
SANDERSON 5094 I believe towards the end of March, or the beginning of April. 
GARROW 5095 For what purpose did you become a member of the Corresponding Society
SANDERSON 5096 On the 14th of April when I first became a member, I was unexpectedly proposed, on the day following T informed Mr. Wickham that I had done so. 
GARROW 5097 What passed between you and the magistrate is not evidence, but in consequence of what passed between you and him, why did you attend the meeting
SANDERSON 5098 To discover whether they had any serious intentions of arming. 
GARROW 5099 You have stated that you communicated something upon the subject, to Mr. Wickham 
SANDERSON 5100  Yes. 
GARROW 5101 Was it with his approbation that you attended the meeting for the purpose you have Dow stated
SANDERSON 5102 It was. 
GARROW 5103 Did you from time to time communicate to Mr. Wickham such facts as came to your knowledge 
SANDERSON 5104 I did. 
GARROW 5105 And went there for the express’ purpose of Procuring information, and giving it
SANDERSON 5106 I did. 
GARROW 5107 When were you first introduced 
SANDERSON 5108 On the 15th of April 1794. 
GARROW 5109 At what division 
SANDERSON 5110 Division No. 11. 
GARROW 5111 Meeting at what place

SANDERSON 5114 Yes. 
GARROW 5115 What number of persons were present at tbat meeting 
SANDERSON 5116 I cannot exactly tell, there might be about thirty. 
GARROW 5117 Did any thing material pass at that meeting
SANDERSON 5118 There was some conversation about the proceedings at Chalk Farm. 
GARROW 5119 Had the meeting then at Chalk Farm taken lace 
SANDERSON 5120 This was the day after the meeting ad been atChalk Farm. ee 
GARROW 5121 What passed with respect to the meeting which had been had at Chalk Farm
SANDERSON 5122 The conversation turned that night principally upon that, and some were talking hat it was necessary to arm to protect the convention, in the same manner as they had in France ; I heard some present talking in consequence of & convention having been talked of at Chalk Farm ihat it would be necessary to arm to defend that convention the same as they had done to protect the Convention in France ; I think it is proper to say that their minds appeared at that time to be very much heated from what had passed at Chalk Farm, and therefore from that circumstance I did not think so much of their being serious. 
GARROW 5123 Do you mean that they were heated with liquor 
SANDERSON 5124 No, not with liquor. hat was described to have passed at Chalk Farm that should so have heated their spirits ?—There were a number of resolutions passed, 
GARROW 5125 Do you recollect any of those resolutions 
SANDERSON 5126 Yes,Iremember one resolution, I can remember some circumstances which occurred at Chalk Farm. 
GARROW 5127 That were stated to have occurred there, you were not there 
SANDERSON 5128 I was at Chalk Farm. 
GARROW 5129 Then you were there before you became a member 
SANDERSON 5130 Yes. 
GARROW 5131 State any circumstances that occurred at Chalk Farm, particularly such as were mentioned in this meeting of the division the night after
SANDERSON 5132 There were a number of resolutions read which I cannot repeat; but one of them cgncluded with the words, brought the head of Charles the First to the block, and sent James the Second from the throne; then a man, whose name I understood was Birks, shouted. I remember a person, whose name I was told Was Richter, mentioned that he had, received a letter from Sheffield, I think, but am not positive to the place, that a great number of persons had met there, and that they were determined to petition parliament no more for a reform; that a convention was intended to be called, and that, I think, he said it was to take place in about six weeks, or a shorter time, 1 cannot recollect the positive words. 
GARROW 5133 Upon Birks’s shouting was any observation made by any persons present at Chalk Farm
SANDERSON 5134 Some persons said that they thought bolding up their hands was sufficient; this man called out, that he wished to be heard at St. James's. 
GARROW 5135 Do you remember Mr. Thelwall being there
SANDERSON 5136 There was a person there whose name I was told was Thelwall, whom I never saw before nor since. 
GARROW 5137 Did that person take any part in the conversation and debate that was going forward
SANDERSON 5138 Yes, he spoke several times. 
GARROW 5139 Do you recollect any particular expression that struck you that he made use of?. thing that Mr. Dundas had threatened to bring the Scotch laws into England, and if they attempted it, they must repel force by force, or something of that sort. 
GARROW 5140 Do you recollect what particular subject respecting the Scotch laws was the subject of conversation 
SANDERSON 5141 I believe it related to same persons that were tried. 
GARROW 5142 What was the expression used
SANDERSON 5143 That infamous and ever to be detested Court of Justiciary in Scotland. 
GARROW 5144 Do you recollect the remainder of that sentence 
SANDERSON 5145 I cannot say I have a positive recollection ; I made no minutes at the time. 
EYRE 5146 You have better evidence I suppose of the resolutions, than of the conversation ? 
GARROW 5147 Was there any direction as to the printing any number of copies of the proccedings of the day 
SANDERSON 5148 I think the number that was ordered to be printed was two hundred thousand.—I cannot say, whether one or two hundred thousand copies of the resolutions, if they should be wanted. a 
GARROW 5149 Which was the next meeting of the division that you were at afterwards
SANDERSON 5150 On the Monday following 1 was at the meeting of another division,

GARROW 5155 Did any thing matecial pass at that time
SANDERSON 5156 I do not recollect any thing particular, any farther than doctor Hodson was recommended by the committee to be relieved. 
GARROW 5157 Where was he at that time, and what was the purpose for which he was to be relieved?was no particular purpose stated, only he was recommended for relief.

GARROW 5170 Was it in the presence of Hillier 
SANDERSON 5171 He was there; all those persons were present; the most material conversation that passed then was from. doctot Hodson; he asked me if I 
GARROW 5172 seen a copy of the new constitution, I told him I was but a young member, and did not know any thing of it; he then informed me that there was a very clever one coming out; the society was to be divided into diviSins, and into small divisions, that the purpese of that was for the convenience of learning the use of arms, at each other’s houses. 
GARROW 5173 What more passed at that time? 
MACDONALD 5174 Did you make that memorandum at the time 
SANDERSON 5175 I did; he informed me that those divisions were to be called tithings; and that the purpose of was likewise to keep spies from getting among them, and betraying their intention; he likewise stated, that their numbers were Increasing, and that they would soon. be too formidable to be resisted. I made an observation, that I did not think, from what I had seen in the society, that they appeared to be men of property, to have money to effect any thing, upon which a Frenchman, who was there, got up and said, when the society was ized, money should not be wanting. 
MACDONALD 5176 7 ‘a8 this Roussel that you have mentioned? 
MACDONALD 5177 —1les, Did any thing more material pass at that tme

MACDONALD 5179 He was then suffering under the sentence of the law, I believe 
SANDERSON 5180 Yes. 
MACDONALD 5181 This was said still in the presence of Hillier
SANDERSON 5182 Yes. 
MACDONALD 5183 Was any thing more said at that meeting that was material 
SANDERSON 5184 Roussel said he was going from there to Thelwall’s, and he should set off the nextday. Lloyd asked him, for the continent, he answered, oui. Hillier asked to France, he answered, yes. 
MACDONALD 5185 When Uillier invited you to go to Newgate to see those persons, who did he ask you to go and see
SANDERSON 5186 The persecuted patriots. 
MACDONALD 5187 Is Mr. Lloyd confined upon any sentence upon a criminal prosecution

MACDONALD 5189 hen was the next meeting of the division

MACDONALD 5201 Was that said as well in the hearing of other members as yourself
SANDERSON 5202 Yes; the secretary stated, that he was very sorry to leave the society just as they were going to act as well as think, and to regenerate their country.

MACDONALD 5214 What were they stated to be for
SANDERSON 5215 To be fixed against the end of poles, and to be used against the military. 
MACDONALD 5216 What were the knives for
SANDERSON 5217 For cutting the reins. 
MACDONALD 5218 Cutting the reins of what 
SANDERSON 5219 I do not recollect whether he particularly explained that. 
MACDONALD 5220 It was stated that those instruments were to act against the military 
SANDERSON 5221 Yes. 
MACDONALD 5222 Do you mean stated in terms, or that you collected that

JURYMEMBER 5226 If who could resist the first shock
SANDERSON 5227 I considered it to be the members of the different societies ; if they could resist the first shock from the army, that there would be no fear afterwards. 
JURYMEMBER 5228 Did they give any reason why the first shock being resisted, there would be no fear afterwards 
SANDERSON 5229  They said the royal family being secured, the army would have no head to Took up to, and would be glad to accept the additional pay that would be offered them. 
JURYMEMBER 5230 ‘Whom was that additional pay to be offered by 
SANDERSON 5231 I understood by the societies. 
JURYMEMBER 5232 Do you remember any observation that Hillier made upon that additional pay being offered to the army with respect to the comparison of sixpence a-day with any other sum
SANDERSON 5233 There was something said, I believe it was cighteen-pence ; thatthe men would not fight for sixpence a-day if they could have eighteen pence, I think it was, but I am not positive to the sum. 
JURYMEMBER 5234 Whether any of the persons present at the time that these observations were made, and these facts stated, made any objection to them 
SANDERSON 5235 None: but I think it is proper to state that one person was very much in liquor, and took no part in that conversation. 
JURYMEMBER 5236 Those who conversed were not in liquor 
SANDERSON 5237 No. 
JURYMEMBER 5238 Those to whom the observations were addressed, except the one who took no part, were they sober 
SANDERSON 5239 Perfectly sober. Did any one make any observation that had a tendency to repress this conversation ?—One 
JURYMEMBER 5240 Street, and his conversation was so violent, and he spoke so loud, that I was obliged to check him, and told him the people in the street were hearing him. 
JURYMEMBER 5241 Do you know a person of the name of Baxter 
SANDERSON 5242 I do. 
JURYMEMBER 5243 Was he a member of the London Corresponding Society 
SANDERSON 5244 I have seen him at divisions. 
JURYMEMBER 5245 At other times since that, have you heard any observation from Hillier or Baxter, upon the subject of arming? —On the 9th of May was the most material conversation I had with Baxter, that was at Hillier’s house; he said he had been with an officer who had been lately. 
JURYMEMBER 5246 Who were the persons present besides Baxter 
SANDERSON 5247 Baxter, this Bennet, Hillier, a man whose name I was told was Hill, and some other persons, whose names I do not know, were present during a part of this conversation ; Baxter stated, that he had been with Mr. Joyce, who was secretary to earl Stanhope: Mr. Joyce told him there was no danper to be apprehended from Stone, that Stone had too much firmness to let them get any thing out of him by intimidation. 
JURYMEMBER 5248 Whom were you speaking of by the name of Stone 
SANDERSON 5249 A person I understood who was confined in Newgate. 
JURYMEMBER 5250 Did you understand he had been examined before his majsty’s privy council
SANDERSON 5251 I understood that he was committed upon a charge of high treason; we had some conversation about Hamilton Rowan’s escape ; he said, earl Stanhope’s speech was to be printed, with an addition, which was to be very cautiously put in ; he said, the committee of correspondence and co-operation were preparing an address to the army, with some strong resolutions ; he said, that prudent and determined men were wanted to propagate the opinions contained in those resolutions. 
JURYMEMBER 5252 Were they wanted to propagate them 
SANDERSON 5253 He stated, that one Moore had been particularly active and successful in getting over the army. 
JURYMEMBER 5254 Did he tell you what description of the army he had been more successful with than the other
SANDERSON 5255 He said, they had most to fear from theyoung recruits; they had succeeded best with the old soldiers in Westminster; he said, if one-third of the army was got over, the other two-thirds would not act with spirit against them; he then asked me if I knew any person who would buy a ike. Whom are you speaking of now?—Baxter. 
EYRE 5256 Who was it said all this 
SANDERSON 5257 Baxter. 
GARROW 5258 Did he mention any thin with respect to his interview with the officers
SANDERSON 5259 Yes, he said that the officers had made use of an expression not fitto be repeated, and asked him why he did not blow them all up together; he said the officer had been lately presented to the queen upon his promotion. 
GARROW 5260 You think it an indecent expression 
SANDERSON 5261 It is as applied to such a person as him ; he said, that the officer had asked Baxter why they did not blow up the whole family together ; he then asked me if I knew any friends who would purchase a pike; I said I should have no objection to purchase one, but that it would be of no use unless I knew how to use it; hesaid, if I went either the Thursday or the Friday inllewing and made use of his name at the sign of the Parrot, in Green-Arbour-court in the Old-Bailey; I was to ask for one Edwards, that he would be called out to me, and I was then to tell him that Baxter had sent me, and then I was to have a pike, andI should be introduced to others, who would learn the use of them with me, and that Edwards was very clever at the use of it, and would assist us in learning; he stated, that pikes were much cheaper than muskets, and that it would be impossible for the number to procure muskets on account of the expense. There is another cicumstance, he stated, that Persons with muskets might do a great deal of mischief if tNey did notknow properly the use of them : I made an observation, that I thought we might have a reform in parliament without coming to blows; he said, is there one man in the society who believes a parliamentary reform is all we want—no, not one; he said, that many menof property had hitherto kept back on account of the sanguinary conduct of the French, but that they were Now willing to come forward, as they were convinced that a revolution might be effected in a few hours ; he said, for his own part, he did not wish the king, or any of his family, to lose their lives, but ih thought they might go to Hanover ; he said, it must be expected that some blood must be shed: some particular persons had offered such insults to the people, that human nature could not overlook ; the conversation afterwards turned relative to Thelwall’s having been indicted, in which there was nothing very material. 
GARROW 5262 Was Hillier present during the whole of this conversation of Baxter 
SANDERSON 5263 Yes. 
GARROW 5264 Was it pronounced in a way in which every person might hear
SANDERSON 5265 They might; but I did Not pay much attention to any thing that fell from him, from this circumstance—that Baxter was one of the committee of correspondenceand co-operation; I thought I should obtain most information from his conversation, therefore I attended more to him. 
GARROW 5266 Did he state whether any, and what number of pikes were ready at that time, at any Place 
SANDERSON 5267 Lle said, that many thousand were Mmakiu y at Sheftield, that the heads were only to come irom there, but that thcy were to be Stochud in wown, 
GARROW 5268 Did he give any caution with respect to conYersing in tie division-mecting, respectin; the pikes, at that time
SANDERSON 5269 He .recommende that nothing of that should be mentioned at any of the division-meetin 3, Ull the new constitution should be adopted, 
GARROW 5270 The new constitution of the society 
SANDERSON 5271 Yes, of the society: 
GARROW 5272 Did he give any reason for the necessity of that caution
SANDERSON 5273 Yes, he said, because there were spies in the society. 
GARROW 5274 Was there any thing said in the course of this conversation with respect to the French emigrants 
SANDERSON 5275 It was stated by Baxter, that it would be adviseable to let those who were prisoners out, and, if the French emigrants attempted to resist, they should share the fate of spies at Paris. 
GARROW 5276 What prisoners 
SANDERSON 5277 The French prisoners of war. 
GARROW 5278 Did he name any of those persons who had offered such insults to the people that human nature could not overlook 
SANDERSON 5279  He named several, I cannot recollect all; Mr. Pitt was one, Mr. Dundas another, and Mr. Reeves, 
GARROW 5280 And other persons 
SANDERSON 5281 Yes. 
GARROW 5282 In the course of thatevening, did you return to your home in company with Baxter 
SANDERSON 5283 I went part of the way home with Baxter. Did he, in the course of your going home, enlarge upon any of the subjects you had been conversing about ?—I understood that the purpose of their address to the army was, to excite a jealousy between our troops and the French emigrants, which were fearon into regiments ; he stated the means that Moore had used to get over some of the army ; that he had told them that by their oath they were to fight for their king and country, but when the king and country were at variance, they had a right to fight on which side they pleased. — 
GARROW 5284 Did he state to you any of the other arguments that Moore had used with the army —. He recommended that I should mix with them, treat them with beer, and enlarge upon the severity of their usage and the smallness of their pay; but I must first sound their principles, and if I found them aristocrats, then I must not go on. 
GARROW 5285 In the course of the evening, when this conversation was had, was Hillier’s pike produced 
SANDERSON 5286 I do not recollect that it was, 
GARROW 5287 Was it produced at any time when any of those persons were present with you
SANDERSON 5288 It was produced after that, at another meeting, on the 16th of May. 
GARROW 5289 Where was that meeting at
SANDERSON 5290 At Hillier’s. 
GARROW 5291 This is not a division meeting, but the meeting of some few members 
SANDERSON 5292 Yes. 
GARROW 5293 Who were the persons present upon the 16th 
SANDERSON 5294 I believe Iam wrong in point of date; it was on the 17th of May. 
GARROW 5295 The attorney general suggests to me, whether it is possible that I should go into any examination respecting facts which took place after the prisoner was in custody ? 
MACDONALD 5296 When was he taken up? 5 
GARROW 5297 On the 12th of May. 
EYRE 5298 No, I think it would not be proper. 
GARROW 5299 Then we do not wish to examine as to any facts which have happened subsequent; I have at present confined my examination to facts prior to his being taken into custody. Do you recollect the circumstance of Mr. Hardy’s being apprehended 
SANDERSON 5300 Ido. 
GARROW 5301 Had you any conversation with respect to admission to the House of Commons? If that was after Hardy was apprehended, I do not inquire into it 
SANDERSON 5302 It was after. 
GARROW 5303 Do you remember a paper being distributed with respect to the Ins and the Outs 
SANDERSON 5304 I do. 
GARROW 5305 Where was that distributed? — At the meeting at the Coach and Horses, in Hattonlen. 
GARROW 5306 Was that before Mr. Hardy was apprehended 
SANDERSON 5307 It was after the apprehension of Mr. Hardy. 
GARROW 5308 With respect to all these circumstances that you collected from time to time, you communicated them to Mr. Wickham, the magistrate, and with his approbation attended these meetings
SANDERSON 5309 I did. 
GARROW 5310 And attended them for the express purpose of giving this information 
SANDERSON 5311 I did. 
ERSKINE 5312  What is your christian name 
GOSLING 5313 Edward. 
ERSKINE 5314 Edward Gosling 
GOSLING 5315 Yes. 
ERSKINE 5316 Are your father and mother living 
GOSLING 5317 Yes. 
ERSKINE 5318 What are you by employment or trade 
GOSLING 5319 At present I am employed by Mr. Wickham. 
ERSKINE 5320 I am not calling you to an account for any general employment, if you are an honest man in the execution of it; do you mean employed in this business? — Yes, and in writing too; I was employed before this business by Mr. Colquhoun, in writing. 
ERSKINE 5321 What sort of writing
GOSLING 5322 Both in Fis private business and on his public business. 
ERSKINE 5323 Mr. Colquhoun is an attorney, is he
GOSLING 5324 No, a magistrate in Worship-street. 
ERSKINE 5325 When did you begin writing for him
GOSLING 5326 About September last, but that was only occasionally. 
ERSKINE 5327 What way of life had you been in before that 
GOSLING 5328 Before that I kept a broker’s shop. 
ERSKINE 5329 Were you a dealer in naval stores; I am not asking any, question you can object to; were you a dealer in naval stores
GOSLING 5330 I never in my life, upon my oath, to my knowledge, bought a store that ever was the property of his majesty, if that is what you mean. 
ERSKINE 5331 I should have no right to ask that question
GOSLING 5332 I know the reason for which it was put; and it is a question which if I was notconscious of my innocence, I has noright to answer, butasI knew I could safely do it, I thought it proper to answer. 
ERSKINE 5333 Then, perhaps, you have never said to any body the direct contrary of what you are saying now to me
GOSLING 5334 I did say the direct contrary; I was asked by Mr. Worship, when I went to buy a print what I was? and what my address was? as I conceived he would not 
ERSKINE 5335 Jet me have the print if I told him I was with a magistrate, I told him I dealt in naval stores. 
ERSKINE 5336 Did you never say to any body that you dealt in naval stores, and that you should think no more of cheating the king than of illotineing him 
GOSLING 5337 Never to my knowledge; 
ERSKINE 5338 will swear positively, I never mentioned the word guillotineing the king. 
ERSKINE 5339 Did you never say to any body, upon your oath, that you lived by smuggling, and cheatine the king in his stores 
GOSLING 5340 Never upon my oath. 
ERSKINE 5341 Have you always gone by the name of Gosling
GOSLING 5342 I have not; and as means were yesterday used to deter me from giving evidence, I am willing to explain them, and am willing to explain why I went by another name ; as I find every advantage is wished to be taken of me, I trust the mercy of the Court will not suffer any improper question to be put to me. 
EYRE 5343 As to any ques tion which tends to accuse you of any crime, not immediately connected with this matter, I will protect you; but at the same time keep your temper, attend to the question, and give a direct answer. 
ERSKINE 5344 I have treated you with civility Iam sure.—Did you ever go by the name of Douglas 
GOSLING 5345 I did 
ERSKINE 5346 When did you first assume the name of Douglas
GOSLING 5347 I believe as much as ten years since. 
ERSKINE 5348 How long did you continue the name of Douglas? 
ERSKINE 5349 Gosling
GOSLING 5350 I would wish to relate the circumstances under which I took that name. 
EYRE 5351 You had better answer the question. 
EYRE 5352 I carried on the business of a hair-dresser in that name, for I believe pretty near seven years. Where did Pha reside 
GOSLING 5353 In Westminster. Where in Westmirister ?—In Petty France, 
EYRE 5354 0. 8. 
EYRE 5355 When did you first come to live in Petty France, No. 3, as a hair-dresser, by the name of Douglas
GOSLING 5356 It is about ten years since; I do not know that I could state exactly the time ; I believe, it must be about the year 1784. 
EYRE 5357 I am not very particularas to dates, I do not want to be in any of your secrets, if there can be any reason in the world for your not choosing to answer me —Had you any at ticular reason for changing your namef—I will state my reason; my father had a shop of business in the city, his business was chiefly in the wig and shaving way; for improvement I wished to go to the west end of the town. I went and worked with a man, whose name was Penton, in Bloomsbury, for improvement; it was, perhaps, trom false pride I did not choose it to be known that I was working as 4 journeyman, when my father kept four of five men; and as for taking the name of Douglas, I took it from aj play-bill. I have no objection to a decent pride, you took a very good name. It struck you ina} 
EYRE 5358 moment to take the name of Douglas from a play-bill
GOSLING 5359 That was the reason that struck me at that time, and I had no thought of continuing under that name. 
EYRE 5360 Pray how long did you play this part of Douglas
GOSLING 5361 I continued near seven years in that name, and it was from this circumstance. 
EYRE 5362 Do you know a Mr. Lincoln
GOSLING 5363 I do, I did not recollect him, but I wish to state some circumstance. 
EYRE 5364 Please to answer my question fitst, do you know Mr. Lincoln 
GOSLING 5365 I do. 
EYRE 5366 Who is Mr. Lincoln 
GOSLING 5367 Mr. Lincoln I understand to be something to Mr. Macnamara; be collects rents for him, I believe. 
EYRE 5368 Did you at any time,—I am not asking you eny thing that is criminal,—did you at any time borrow any money of him
GOSLING 5369 I did, and will state the circumstances if you please. 
EYRE 5370 How long ago is it that you borrowed any money, and what sum of him
GOSLING 5371 I am Upon my oath, I do not know the particular gum, nor cannot state the particular time; -I believe it is four or five years ago. 
EYRE 5372 Was it ten guineas
GOSLING 5373 Ten pound, or guieas, I do not know which. 
EYRE 5374 Did you give him a note for it 
GOSLING 5375 Yes, in the name of George Douglas, part of which 1 
EYRE 5376 id, part my wife paid, and the remainder ie has been since paid. 
EYRE 5377 When did you pay part of it yourself
GOSLING 5378 I cannot state the time. 
EYRE 5379 Did not Mr. Lincoln come into the London toffee-house by mere accident, where the Witnesses for the crown are, I believe, provided with what is fit for them to have, and gaw you there, and said, how do you do Douglas(—Permit me to explain, that that was Botthe way; that wouldcarry a different construction from the manner in which it was done. Mr. Macnamara first came himself, whem I never had seen; he asked me quesfons; I told him a stair-case there with a manIhad never seen, was not a place to enter into an explanation upon the subject. 
EYRE 5380 Tam not speaking about Mr. Macnamara, but asking what passed when Mr. Lincoln came into the London coffce-house 
GOSLING 5381 I was, m Mr. Macnamara’s conduct to me, so confused, that I hardly knew what I said. 
EYRE 5382 Mr. Macnamara had been there before, and hed behaved in-such a manner that you were 8 flurried that you did not know what you said to Mr. Lincoln when he came in 
GOSLING 5383 I declare, I did not recollect Mr. Lincoln’s person, having never seen him but once or twice in my life. 
EYRE 5384 But you recollect what you said to me, not two minutes ago; that Mr. Macnamara had been there before, and had behaved in such a fsanner, that when Mr. Lincoln came, you were so confused, from Mr. Macnamara’s conduct, that you hardly knew what yousaid
GOSLING 5385 I certainly did say 50, 
EYRE 5386 He said to you, how do youdo Douglas 
GOSLING 5387 He did not. When he came up, he asked me first what my name was? I said, Edward Gosling; said he, did you never go by any other name? did not you rent a house of me? my name is Macnamara ; J said, this is not a place proper for explanation; he said, I came out of bumanity to you, know you gavea note to Mr. Lincoln, some part of which is not paid, and I only came out of humanity to you to inform you, that when you appear in evidence this will be brought forward. 
EYRE 5388 What would be brought forward 
GOSLING 5389 This note would be produced. I told him I had not the money. I offered Mr. Lincoln the money afterwards. 
EYRE 5390 Did. you know where Mr. Lincoln lived in the interval, between the time when you borrowed the money from bim and to the time you saw Mr. Macnamara and Mr. Lincoln at the London coffee-house
GOSLING 5391 I knew where he lived at the time I borrowed it; I do not know whether Mr. Lincola had moved or not. 
EYRE 5392 Had you seen him in the interval
GOSLING 5393 I paida part of the money, and my wife paid another partofit. It was to be paid by instalments. 
EYRE 5394 Let me ask an explanation of something, which I confess I did not understand; how came you to say ty Mr. Worship that yoa dealt in naval stures
GOSLING 5395 Because I thought that would preclude all inquiry; because I did not choose to give him my address; because thought if he found I was with Mr. Wickham, he would refuse then to let me have what I wanted. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5396 Do you mean Worship, the engraver 
GOSLING 5397 Yes; I saw he suspected I was not friendly to their cause. 
ERSKINE 5398 Who 13 Mr. Worship
GOSLING 5399 A secretary of a division of the Corresponding Society. 
ERSKINE 5400 Did you never make use of the expressions that I asked you to before, that you cared no more for cheating the king than the expression I stated before 
GOSLING 5401 Never in my life. 
ERSKINE 5402 Task you, upon your oath, whether many of these expressions, which you have been stating to-night, you did not make use of yourself, and endeavour to excite those people to do the things that you have been relating of them, and were reprimanded by them repeatedly for it 
GOSLING 5403 Never, 
ERSKINE 5404 Upon no one occasion 
GOSLING 5405 The only thing I ever did, I will state: that, on the Tuesday, after the apprehension of Hardy, I mentioned what had passed at the division, in Comptonstrect, relative to the committee of emergency, and to know whether it was their intention to do the same. 
ERSKINE 5406 Lask you, upon your oath, whether you were not in the constant course of using inflammatory expressions, which I will not repeat, going from one society to another using inflammatory expressions to excite those people to say to you things which you wanted them to say 
GOSLING 5407 I never wished, and do not to my knowledge know, thatever used any one expression of the kind; in some respects I may have appeared to have approved of their proceedings with the view which was my sole design. I did not wishto lead Baxteron, nordid I find fault with him, from this circumstance, ‘that as I had reason to believe, thatarms were secreted, and it was my wish to discover where they were, that they might be found, and the mischief prevented. 
ERSKINE 5408 It was natural you should say nothing if you went with a view of discovering that which was dangerous to the public.—But I ask you, whether you did not go about from place to place using the most ‘inflammatory expressions
GOSLING 5409 I never did. 
ERSKINE 5410 You say that positively 
GOSLING 5411 Yes. 
ERSKINE 5412 That you never did use inflammatory expressions of the sort that you have been mentioning
GOSLING 5413 No. 
ERSKINE 5414 Dol understand you to swear positively then, that you never made use ofany inflammatory expressions, when I put you in mind of some of them now.—Why do not the society learn the use of arms, it would be of great use, there isnothing to be done without arms 
GOSLING 5415 ] never made use of such an expression ever. 
ERSKINE 5416 Nor ever made use of any expression of that nature, to excite any of the people at the socicties to believe you would do mischief of any sort 
GOSLING 5417 No, never to my knowledge, I never used any inflammatory expression, or any means to excite them to disturbance, or any means whatever. 
ERSKINE 5418 Now go to your notes, and tell me what days, apd at what places you attended in the prosecution of that which was extremely laudable, if it was honest, the times and the places.—But before I trouble you with that, do you knowa Mrs. Coleman
GOSLING 5419 I do not. 
ERSKINE 5420 Look across to the jury 
GOSLING 5421 I donot know a Mrs. Coleman now. 
ERSKINE 5422 ae you ever know a Mrs. Coleman 
GOSLING 5423 T did. 
ERSKINE 5424 Had you any dealings of any sort with her 
GOSLING 5425 Certainly, she rented a shop of me. 
ERSKINE 5426 Had you no dealingsof any other sort? Tam not putting a question of any immoral nature f—Certainly I had business, she rented a shop of me. 
ERSKINE 5427 Is that all
GOSLING 5428 She died at my house, and I buried her. 
ERSKINE 5429 Did she leave any will 
GOSLING 5430 Yes. 
ERSKINE 5431 Whom did she leave her property to
GOSLING 5432 Her property was partly left to one Burroughs, and ay to one James Leech. 
ERSKINE 5433 Who made the will
GOSLING 5434 I wrote it. Do you know Mrs. Biffin ?—I do not. 
ERSKINE 5435 You were very ill used about that business, in which you ,had done nothing but that which was right? 
ERSKINE 5436 Gosling
GOSLING 5437 How ill used? 
ERSKINE 5438 I mean you got into some dispute and trouble about it
GOSLING 5439 None at all, I was-in no trouble about it. 
ERSKINE 5440 There was no complaint made against you ot any sort
GOSLING 5441 There was no just cause of comint. 
ERSKINE 5442 Ido not ask whether there was any just cause of complaint, but was there any com plaint made against you by any body upon the subject 
GOSLING 5443 I cannot say I recollect the particular circumstances that might pass, there was a brother by a former husband who came up out of the country. 
ERSKINE 5444 Do not understand me to be doing so improper a thing as to be imputing any crime to you, and to ask you to reveal it; far from it, I only ask whether any body was wicked enough to make any complaint of your conduct in that case 
GOSLING 5445 I do not know that there was any complaint. 
ERSKINE 5446 Will you swear there was none, upon your oath, was there no complaint made against you upon the subject of this will
GOSLING 5447 TI canna tell what complaints may have been made. 
ERSKINE 5448 Upon your oath, was there not a complaint made against you, to your knowledge, for fa bricating this will
GOSLING 5449 Never, that I know of. 
ERSKINE 5450 Will you swear that 
GOSLING 5451 I will swear I never heard any such thing. 
ERSKINE 5452 Who was Mr. Leech
GOSLING 5453 A man who was formerly an apprentice, and kept a shcp nearly opposite, who set up in opposition to 
ERSKINE 5454 In what trade 
GOSLING 5455 In the same business of a hair-dresser. 
ERSKINE 5456 And that woman died at your house and left her property to him
GOSLING 5457 I did not say she left her property to him. ‘ 
ERSKINE 5458 Tasked you to whom she left her property
GOSLING 5459 I told pn to be divided equally between s person of the name of Burroughs, at Edmonton, and a James Leech. 
ERSKINE 5460 Was that James Leech your rival oppo site
GOSLING 5461 No. 
ERSKINE 5462 Who was that James Leech to whom this woman left this money 
GOSLING 5463 A son of my wife's 
ERSKINE 5464 Who was Burroughs, who was that otha person 
GOSLING 5465 A cousin of her’s or some such tine. 
ERSKINE 5466 hat connexion had you with the woman
GOSLING 5467 I had no connexion, any farther than ren dering her every service in my power, during a long illness, in which I was at considerable expense. 
ERSKINE 5468 How long had she lodged at your house 
GOSLING 5469 I cannot tell exactly. 
ERSKINE 5470 A year
GOSLING 5471 I cannot tell. 
ERSKINE 5472 Will you swear that she lived six months with you 
GOSLING 5473 I do not know the time. on ittwo months ?—It was longer than at. 
ERSKINE 5474 Three months 
GOSLING 5475 Longer than that. 
ERSKINE 5476 Four months 
GOSLING 5477 I cannot state to a month. 
ERSKINE 5478 Was the will made by an attorney 
GOSLING 5479 It vas not. 
ERSKINE 5480 By yourself 
GOSLING 5481 Yes. 
ERSKINE 5482 Am I to take you that you mean to swear now, that no complaint was made against yoa as having forged that will
GOSLING 5483 I swear, that to the best of my knowledge or recollectivn, I never heard such a thing. ‘ 
ERSKINE 5484 Will you swear positively, you never have been charged with it; a man that is charged with a capital felony cannot forget it
GOSLING 5485 I do not recollect that ever I was. 
ERSKINE 5486 od! Do you mean to swear that you do not remember whether you were charged with a capital felony or not 
GOSLING 5487 I do not know that I ever was. 
ERSKINE 5488 Will you swear positively that no such charge was brought against you
GOSLING 5489 I can swear no farther than, that tothe best of my knowledge, it never was. 
EYRE 5490 A charge brought when and where 
GOSLING 5491 it may be a fact within his knowledge, or it may not. 
ERSKINE 5492 I am asking you whether there was not acomplaint made, that you were charged in your own presence with having done it 
GOSLING 5493 Never, to my knowlodge. 
ERSKINE 5494 Amto understand that there was not a complaint made in your presence against you for having forged that will
GOSLING 5495 I do not recollect that any person ever did. 
ERSKINE 5496 Will not you go the length of swearing that nobody ever did do so
GOSLING 5497 I can only speak to the best of my recollection and knowledge. 
GARROW 5498 I submit to your lordship that is the only answer a witness can make to such a question. 
EYRE 5499 There is no occasion for your interrupting the examination ; probably, it is an answer; but he may be pressed to see whether he can answer farther or not. 
ERSKINE 5500 Whether any body ever charged you with it in your presence
GOSLING 5501 I never recollect that any person ever did. 
ERSKINE 5502 Do you know a Mr. Coxi—Yes ; I know Mr. Cox, a cheesemonger. 
ERSKINE 5503 How long have you known him 
GOSLING 5504 I canne exactly state how long I have dealt with im. 
ERSKINE 5505 Dealt with him in what
GOSLING 5506 In cheesemongery and butter, and things of that kind, and some hams. 
ERSKINE 5507 cid the use of your family 
GOSLING 5508 Yes ; and to sell. 
ERSKINE 5509 I thought you were a hair dresser; what! do you deal in hams 
GOSLING 5510 My wife kept a shop of that sort, and I dressed hair. 
ERSKINE 5511 Have vou never had any other sort of dealings with Mr. Cox, than that which any man has witha fair tradesman that bought hams of him in the ordinary course of business 
GOSLING 5512 No. 
ERSKINE 5513 And you swear that, positively 
GOSLING 5514 I do not remember any thing else; if you name any co charge, if1t comes within my knowedge, I will own it. 
ERSKINE 5515 I do not stand here to make charges. 
ERSKINE 5516 Gosling
GOSLING 5517 I purchased hams of him, and in some there were great holes filled up with mortar and stones. 
ERSKINE 5518 ‘Then the hams were of a bad quality, filled up with mortar and stones
GOSLING 5519 Some of them were. 
ERSKINE 5520 Then Mr. Cox, the cheesemonger, seems to have cheated you 
GOSLING 5521 Certainly ; he did not use me well when I was ignorant in the business. 
ERSKINE 5522 Mr. Macnamara came in order to intimidate you from being a witness here ? 
EYRE 5523 Consider whether it will be prudent to go into an examination upon that; if Mr. Macnamara has been so imprudentas to go into a coffee-house, and talk to the witness, it would be at best an incautious thing for a gentleman to go where the crown witnesses are, to enter into conversation with them ; and, I think, it had better not be done ; I hope no other gentleman will do it. 
ERSKINE 5524 I am sure he did not. 
GARROW 5525 I shall examine to it. 
ERSKINE 5526 Y ou will examine to it when I have done, I suppose? 
ERSKINE 5527 Am I to understand you to say, that you never dealt at all in stores, I do not mean to say dishonestly or improperly ? 
ERSKINE 5528 Gosling
GOSLING 5529 W hat kind of stores? 
ERSKINE 5530 Naval stores ship stores
GOSLING 5531 I have purchased old cordage, bad sacking, and such Pind of things; but those I do not consider to come under the denomination of naval stores. 
ERSKINE 5532 What were the articles that you purchased
GOSLING 5533 What is commonly called hand stufting, used for making of paper. 
ERSKINE 5534 Did you never say, 1 do not ask you whether you did it, because I have no right to do that, ut you never said that you were a dealer in raw materials; that the person you spoke to, asked you to explain it; and whether in answer to that you said that you attended the sale of his majesty’s stores at the dock-yards, at Sheerness, and so on, that you were well acquainted with the store-keepers, and that you generally bought them at a fifth of their value, by feeing the store-keepers tocondemn them 
GOSLING 5535 I never said that, I will relate to you one circumstance upon which that is taken : I wished to get information respecting them, and Mr. Colquhoun would give me credit for that; it was upon that very business I was taken into his employment to give intelligence respecting that, f understood from iliier that he had a relation who was a quarter-master there, and I wished, through his means, to obtain information for the service of government. 
ERSKINE 5536 Why you had a great deal upon your hands you say you told him the same as (Mr. Worship ; you did not tell Mr. Worship that 
GOSLING 5537 I told him I was a dealer in naval stores. 
ERSKINE 5538 But did you tell Mr. Worship that the way you dealt was by feeing the store-kcepers to condemn them 
GOSLING 5539 No, I did not tell him that. 
ERSKINE 5540 When you were reproved for that, did you not justify your conduct, and say that you had followed the practice for years, and thought it. no crime to cheat the king
GOSLING 5541  Never. 
ERSKINE 5542 Was it in the service of Mr. Colquhoun, that you bought that paper stuff and things? 
ERSKINE 5543 —I never bought any paper stuff belonging to his majesty in my life, upon my oath. 
ERSKINE 5544 But I ask you, were you both a dealer in Stores yourself honestly; and were you employed as an informer to prevent other poople ; 
ERSKINE 5545 eing dishonest
GOSLING 5546 I never had, to my knowledge, any charge brought against me for dishonesty for it, I obtained every infurmation I could to prevent children and other persons, that might be tempted to purloin things, the information was not given against any person, but merely hints to prevent piltering, no person was accused upon that pepmationy, nor did I receive any reward for it. 
ERSKINE 5547 I do not comprehend you, explain to me what was the reason why you told Hillier you had been in the constant course of cheating government in that fashion
GOSLING 5548 I did not tell Hillier I had been in a constant, course of cheating the king; he mentioned to me his having a relation a quarter-master at the yards, and to whom he talked of sending some of the resolutions; I thought that from him, as it is the quarter-master that puts up the stores, that I might obtain some information relative to those stores. 
ERSKINE 5549 Is that an answer to my question? TI asked you why you told Mr. Hillier you were in the course of doing that which you have been now stating
GOSLING 5550 I did not tell him I had been in the course of cheating the king at all. 
ERSKINE 5551 Nor any thing to that effect 
GOSLING 5552 I only told him that I wasa dealer in naval stores, nothing farther. 
ERSKINE 5553 Did you ever tell him that there were great quantities of copper conveyed out of the ducks, and the manner in which it is conveyed out
GOSLING 5554 Never, the manner in which it is conveyed out. 
ERSKINE 5555 Whether you did not tell him the copper was conveyed out of the dock-yards in butterfirkins
GOSLING 5556 No; I have given information to Mr. Colquhoun. that copper has ‘been sent away, but that was not from the king’s stores ; but supposed to be copper fraudulently conveyed away. 
ERSKINE 5557 iam asking you, whether you did not tell him you had been employed yourself in conreying away this euprets—I never told him that Twas employed; I wished to gain what information I could from him, and that was the sole purpose. 
ERSKINE 5558 Did you ever tell him that you were acqualnted with a woman who lived somewhere about Tooley-street, and that there were twelve hundred weight found upon ber pre“mises
GOSLING 5559 I told him ‘a had heard such a seizure had been made, but I never saw the woman in my life; had heard of it, and merely related that I had heard that such a thing was the fact. 
ERSKINE 5560 Now I have nothing more to ask of you except the dates, which you will be so good as to give me with great correctness; what was the first time that you attended any of those societies 
GOSLING 5561 The 15th of April; upon the 14th, 
ERSKINE 5562 I was at a meeting at Chalk Farm ; I became a member on the 15th. 
ERSKINE 5563 You never saw the prisoner atany of those meetings 
GOSLING 5564 I should not know his person again; I do not know that I did. 
ERSKINE 5565 What part of the meeting were you in at Chalk Farm—were you in the room 
GOSLING 5566 No, out in the grounds :in the crowd. 
ERSKINE 5567 what day were you at any division meeting of the society 
GOSLING 5568 On the 15th of April. 
ERSKINE 5569 At what place
GOSLING 5570 At the Hope, in Northampton-street. 
ERSKINE 5571 What was the next time
GOSLING 5572 The Monday following, I believe. 
ERSKINE 5573 I wish you to be correct 
GOSLING 5574 I do not know that, I have not every paper with me. 
ERSKINE 5575 But such papers as you have, that will furnish me with dates, let me have them
GOSLING 5576 On Monday following, I was at Morris's, in Brick-lane. 
ERSKINE 5577 What number of persons were there at that time
GOSLING 5578 About twenty-five or twenty-six,Isuppose, 
ERSKINE 5579 You did not know their persons 
GOSLING 5580 I knew the persons of some of them. 
ERSKINE 5581 Be so good as to name them 
GOSLING 5582 Bennet and Hillier; there were other persons, captain Williams, I believe, was there, an American. 
ERSKINE 5583 And about twenty-four or twenty-five sons ; now what was the next night 
GOSLING 5584 On the Tuesday following, I was at the hope. 
ERSKINE 5585 Were Hillier and Bennett there 
GOSLING 5586 Hilher was there. 
ERSKINE 5587 How many persons might be present there
GOSLING 5588 About seven or eight and twenty. 
ERSKINE 5589 I understand you to say the conversations, you have heen relating, were not accidental ones, but that it was the general scope of the conversation almost every night 
GOSLING 5590 That night at Morris’s I did not hear any thing about arming. 
ERSKINE 5591 When did you hear about arming 
GOSLING 5592 The 22nd was the night when the delegate Wright made that observation, and the answer was given by Gordon, the secretary. 
ERSKINE 5593 What was the next night upon which you heard any of those abominable expressions which you have sworn to here 
GOSLING 5594 On the 29th of April, there was a conversation about arming. 
ERSKINE 5595 On what night, and at what place was that horrible expression made use of concetning the king 
GOSLING 5596 That was not at a division, that was at Hillier’s house. 
ERSKINE 5597 What was the date of that
GOSLING 5598 That was the 25th of April. 
ERSKINE 5599 Who were present
GOSLING 5600 A man whose name Ewas tok! was Hicksley (who introduced the subject by saying he had received a letter from Sheffield), Hillier, Bennett, another person, whose name I do not know, and anether man who appeared to be in liquor 
ERSKINE 5601 Are you eeraret to swear positively, that you heard those expressions which yeu have swot'n to
GOSLING 5602 I have they are true. 
ERSKINE 5603 And you stick to that
GOSLING 5604 I do. 
ERSKINE 5605 ly sworn them, 
ERSKINE 5606 Where were you upon the 29th
GOSLING 5607 At the Hope. 
ERSKINE 5608 Who were present at the, Hope
GOSLING 5609 There were two divisions met there that night, No. 11, and No. 6. 
ERSKINE 5610 What number were there of each 
GOSLING 5611 I suppose about forty or fifty persons together. 
ERSKINE 5612 Were there any expressions about arming that night 
GOSLING 5613 There was a print proposed by Worship the engraver, and recommended to the use of the society. 
ERSKINE 5614 Was there any thing about arming for the of threatening the king, or overturning the government 
GOSLING 5615 No expression of overturning the government ; but it was recommended to them to learn the use of arms. 
ERSKINE 5616 But was any particular purpose stated 
GOSLING 5617 I do not recollect, that there was any particular se stated. 
ERSKINE 5618 At what time, besides the two you have spoken of, did you hear the expressions that you have related 
GOSLING 5619 I have, at different times, ofwhich I have not the dates, heard other people speaking of it, and approving of it. Do you mean members of the society a?—Yes. What member ?—Birks, the same I saw at Chalk farm. 
ERSKINE 5620 What is his christian name 
GOSLING 5621 I do not know. 
ERSKINE 5622 What did Birks say to you 
GOSLING 5623 I do not recollect the particular conversation, because I did not minute the words, therefore I will not attempt to swear to the conversation; I: likewise heard a man of the name of ‘Kelly, and likewise I heard Eaton talk of arming. 
ERSKINE 5624 Tt was an armed association of sixty people; but armed for those wicked purposes you have been talking of 
GOSLING 5625 I heard Kelly say so, after the apprehension of Hardy. 
GARROW 5626 You said Worship produced an engraving at one of the meetings; cast your eye upon that paper; is that one of the engravings he preduced [showing the witnessa copper-plate print of the manual exercise.]
GOSLING 5627 I believe this to be one of them; this was brought es a proof it was to be published the next day; 
GARROW 5628 brought it to the society, that they might see it. 
GARROW 5629 What have the soldiers got upon their heads 
GOSLING 5630 He mentioned, that they were Sans Culottes; and the caps on their heads were te be coloured red. 
GARROW 5631 This is an engraving of the manual exercise, and of platoon firing
GOSLING 5632  Yes. 
GARROW 5633 When you applied to him, lest he should Suspect you were connected with a magistrate, you told him you were a dealer in naval stores 
GOSLING 5634 I did. 
GARROW 5635 And afterwards, in the rest of: the conversation, you kept up that representation
GOSLING 5636  I did. 
GARROW 5637 How long is it ago since you gave a note to Mr Lincoln, Mc Macnamara's Agent
GOSLING 5638 I cannot exactly state the time; about four or five years. 
GARROW 5639 Did you give it to Mr. Macnamara, or to Mr. Lincoln 
GOSLING 5640 To Mr. Lincoln.’ 
GARROW 5641 How much was the amount 
GOSLING 5642 Ten pounds, or ten guineas. 
GARROW 5643 How much, at this moment is due upon that note 
GOSLING 5644 I believe three guineas. 
GARROW 5645 Have you ever had any application from Mr. Macnamara, for the money, till after attending this court, in virtue of his majesty’s writ of subpoena, and anrong the witnesses for the crown 
GOSLING 5646 I never saw Mr. Macnamara in my life before yesterday, not to know him. 
GARROW 5647 I need hardly ask you, whether you had had any personal application from Mr. Macnamara, to pay this money 
GOSLING 5648  Never. 
GARROW 5649 Had youhad any application, upon his part, till you were subpcenaed as a witness 
GOSLING 5650 I did not see him myself; I heard Mr. Lincoln had called upon me. 
GARROW 5651 How long ago 
GOSLING 5652 Three or four years ago. 
GARROW 5653 Did Mr. Macnamara come to you alone 
GOSLING 5654 I was sitting at dinner; a person came, and said, some person came to speak tome; I found Mr. Macnamara alone. 
GARROW 5655 He said he came out of hamanity to you
GOSLING 5656 He said, that he was 2 man of property, and bad a large estate in the country; that he was a friend to the king and constitution ; that he would see strict justice done; and he came out of humanity to me to let me know, that this would be produced against me in court. 
GARROW 5657 If what
GOSLING 5658 He did not say what. 
GARROW 5659 Did Mr. Macnamara demand the money, or desire you to pay it ? —He asked me, if I remembered the circumstance ; I said it was an improper place to enter into an explanation ; I did not know Mr. Macnamara’s person; I told him, if he did, I must meet it in court. 
GARROW 5660 You have been asked a vast number of questions, respecting Mrs. Coleman’s will; was there any suit instituted to dispute the legality of that will 
GOSLING 5661 None. 
GARROW 5662 Was there any prosecution for that which is called the forgery of it
GOSLING 5663 None. 
GARROW 5664 Was there ever, to your knowledge, any complaint made against you, that there was any thing foul in the transaction 
GOSLING 5665 Not that I know of; the brother came to town, and apy peared perfectly satisfied. 
GARROW 5666 Was it, upon your oath, 2 fair, honest transaction, as far as you had any thing to do with it; aye or no 
GOSLING 5667 It was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5668 Y our lordship will recollect that Mr. Gosling, last night, spoke of a conversation, in Newgate, at which persons of the names of Roussel and Hillier were pean We are now going to prove, that ussel was a member of the London Corresponding Society, with a view to produce some papers found upon him. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5669 Did you find that paper 
GURNELL 5670 Yes ; I found it at Mr. Hardy’s house. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5671  19th July, 1792. “ Division 37, Number 47; Mr. Roussel, No. 4, Shepherd-street, New Bond-street. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5672 Look at that book (showing the witness a pamphict, intituled, “ Explanation of an Encain of the Manual Exercise and Platoon iring ] has that your hand-writing upon it
GURNELL 5673 1t has, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5674 Where did you find that 
GURNELL 5675 I found it in Mr. Roussel’s apartment. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5676 Look at that song [showing it to the witness]
GURNELL 5677 This has my hand-writing on it; I found this in Mr. Roussel’s apartment. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5678 Where was Roussel’s apartment 
GURNELL 5679 In George-street, Black-friars; Roussel was present at the time. 
GIBBS 5680  Who was with you, when you found these papers 
BAILEY 5681  John Coomber, an officer. 
GIBBS 5682 Who desired you to go
BAILEY 5683 Mr. Wickham, a magistrate. 
GIBBS 5684 When did you find them 
BAILEY 5685 On the 19th of May. 
GIBBS 5686 I submit to your lordship, that, according to the rule iad down yesterday, the song is not evidence, being found after Mr. Hardy was taken up. 
EYRE 5687  I wish it had been observed before. 
GIBBS 5688 I wish it had; but I did not know it till I came to the cross-examination of the witness. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5689 I submit to your lordship, that the book must be evidence ; because the book, your lordship sees, is an explanation of the pareve plate, which has been produced, and which was found before the pons was in custody. 
GIBBS 5690 How do T Tide that this was jot: printed after the apprehension of Mr. 
GIBBS 5691 ly? 
EYRE 5692 The other was found before ; the material objection is, that this may have been printed afterwards; it was found afterwards, and there is no evidence of its existence before; therefore it must be rejected, unless you are prepared to show, that the printing existed before. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5693 The papers Iam now going to produce were found, one in the custody of Mr.Martin, the other of Mr. Thelwall; they were found in their custody certainly after the prisoner was apprehended, but they bear date in April, 1794; and they appear, upon the face of them, to have been prepared for the Chalk Farm meeting. 
GIBBS 5694 I only wish to have lordship’s opinion ; I do not mean to take up the time of the Court; it seems to me, that there is certainly the same objection to this paper, as to those which were offered before, of whatever date fey may be, unless they can prove, either that they were in the possession of the prisoner, or of some member of the London Corresponding Society, before he was apprehended, or that he put that date to them; the circumstance and bearing of the date certainly is not evidence: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5695 Supposing the objection to be well founded, which I do not admit, I believe I can prove, that the paper had an actual existence in the month of April, 1794. 
GIBBS 5696 Prove they existed in thesession of some member of the London Corresponding Society. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5697 I will prove, that they existed in the possession of Mr. Martin. 
LAW 5698  Were you present at the Globe-tavern, in the Strand, on the 20th of January, 1794
BAILEY 5699 I was. 
LAW 5700 At a general meeting of the London Corresponding Society 
BAILEY 5701 It was. 
LAW 5702 Were you a member of that society 
BAILEY 5703 No, not at that time. 
LAW 5704 When did you become a member of thst society 
BAILEY 5705 Very early in the month of Fehaere. Did you make any observations of the proceedings which took place on the 30th of January, 1794?—Yes. 
LAW 5706 What was your inducement to become 8 wrailies of that society
BAILEY 5707 I was desired 9 to do. 
LAW 5708 You became a member for the purpose of discovering their proceedings 
BAILEY 5709 I was d by a particular gentleman to go there for that purpose, whose name I will mention, if you choose it. i. 
LAW 5710 There is no occasion for mentioning the name’; relate as well as you can what on the 20th of January, 1794, at the Globetavern 
BAILEY 5711 There was a very great assembly of people there, and I believe Mr. Martin wss called to the chair, who read ‘an’ address, and I believe a Mr. Richter afterwards readaover again. 
LAW 5712 Do you recollect any particular toast that j was drank upon that occasion
BAILEY 5713 I do not recollect any particular toast now, but a great number were read, and by the paper that was printed I should be able to refresh my memory. 
LAW 5714 You toe no paper that you had at the time 
BAILEY 5715 I have none. 
LAW 5716 Do you recollect any conversation held by any of the members of that society at that meeting—what was the language
BAILEY 5717 In general the language was universal suffrage and. annual parliaments; they were met for that purpose. 
LAW 5718 Was it mentioned in that society by what means those objects were to be obtained 
BAILEY 5719 Not that day; I heard nothing that day about the means. 
LAW 5720 Did you hear at any subsequent meeting any conversation with any member of the Corresponding Society by what means that object was to be obtained 
BAILEY 5721 I always understood that they were to be obtained 
GIBBS 5722 We do not mind what you always understood; relate what any body said. 
LAW 5723 What was publicly professed in any of the meetings of that society to be the object and the means 
BAILEY 5724 By enlightening the minds of the lower orders of the people, to give them opportunities of instruction, that they might know what the natural freedom of all mankind was. 
LAW 5725 Did they say how they were to carry into effect that purpose 
BAILEY 5726 By the distribution of certain papers calculated for their understandings. 
GIBBS 5727 Does your lordship think that this sort of examination ought to go on without mentioning the name of any person from whom it came? it is, your lordship sees, utterly impossible for us to have an opportunity of contradicting this kind of evidence. 
EYRE 5728 If he knows who the persuns were who mentioned these particulars he is now stating, he ought to give their names ; if he dues not know the names of the persons, he should state it as being said by persons of that society. 
LAW 5729 Do you recollect any conversation held by persons whom you recollect to have been members of the London Corresponding Society respecting the means by which these objects were to be obtained 
BAILEY 5730 I cannot recollect any particular person; but I may venture to say It was the general voice of the society. Did you hear any thing publicly expressed iu the society about arms ‘—No, never. 
LAW 5731 Were you present at any lecture of Mr. Thelwall’s
BAILEY 5732 I have two or three times been there, 
LAW 5733 What was the sort of exhortation, the object of those lectures 
BAILEY 5734 That is a matter of opinion 1 believe, if I am allowed to give my opinion upon those lectures I will. 
LAW 5735 Tam not asking your opinion of their general tendency, but what was the substance of them 
BAILEY 5736 I was'a general abuse of administation altogether. 
LAW 5737 Did he speak of the branches of the legislature 
BAILEY 5738 Certainly, in their respective capacities. 
LAW 5739 In what manner did he represent them? 
LAW 5740 —In every way that was truly ridiculous. 
LAW 5741 In what manner did he speak of his majesty
BAILEY 5742 In terms of contempt. 
EYRE 5743 What were those terms of contempt
BAILEY 5744 I have heard him make use of the word Solomon. 
EYRE 5745 Did you ever hear him speak of the House of Lords and speak of the utility or inutility of that branch of legislature 
BAILEY 5746 I have. 
EYRE 5747 What did he say about the House of Lords
BAILEY 5748 He said that it was an aristocratic branch that swallowed up almost every other funce tion of the government. 
EYRE 5749 Did he recommend the abolition of any of those parts
BAILEY 5750 A new modellation he recommended. 
EYRE 5751 In what manner did he recommend them to be new modelled 
BAILEY 5752 By the general sense of the country. ‘ 
EYRE 5753 How to be taken 
BAILEY 5754 By annual parliaments and universal suffrage. 
EYRE 5755 Did he recommend any particular means of obtaining those annual parliaments
BAILEY 5756 If I understood him right, his meaning was. 
EYRE 5757 Did you ever hear him mention a convention 
BAILEY 5758 Yes, by calling together the whole body of the people. 
EYRE 5759 Did he recommend that measure 
BAILEY 5760 He certainly did. 
EYRE 5761 He recommended a convention for the puspose of new modelling the government and obtaining annual parliaments and universal suffrage 
BAILEY 5762 Yes. 
EYRE 5763 Were you present at Chalk Farm 
BAILEY 5764 I was, 
EYRE 5765 On what day were you there 
BAILEY 5766 If I recol lect right, the 14th of April. 
EYRE 5767 Was there a very large assembly of persons there 
BAILEY 5768 There was a very large assembly of persons there. 
EYRE 5769 Do you know the persons of any present 
BAILEY 5770 I do now know, I was not ‘then sufficiently acquainted to describe them, but since I have 4 means of knowledge. 
EYRE 5771 Do you know the prisoner 
BAILEY 5772 Yes. 
EYRE 5773 Was he among the persons present 
BAILEY 5774 He was. 
EYRE 5775 Who was in the chair
BAILEY 5776 I believe a man of the name of Lovett. 
EYRE 5777 What passed at that mipeLNs 
BAILEY 5778 There was a letter read from a society called the Frieads of the People, which letter contained — 
EYRE 5779 No matter, you must not state the contents of the letter. 
LAW 5780 State any conversation and transactions at that mecting which you recollect by any persons whom you have since known to be members of the London Corresponding Society ; what was proposed to be done there
BAILEY 5781 The proposal was, that there should be an address. 
LAW 5782 Have you no other recollection of what you heard read or spoken
BAILEY 5783 If I may be allowed to look at a paper J have in my pocket. 
EYRE 5784 If he can speak to any particulars that happened there beyond the address, and what is contained in the address, to be sure it will be proper to examine him toit; I believe the address is in evidence. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5785 It has not yet been read, but I am going to read it. 
LAW 5786 Were any printed papers delivered at that mecting 
BAILEY 5787 There were.

LAW 5790 “ At a General Mecting of the London Corres“ ponding Society, Aed on the Green, at “ Chalk Farm, on Monday the 14th of April, “1794, J. Lovett in the Chater, the follow“ing Letters were read : 
LAW 5791 “ To the Chairman of the Society of the Friends of the People. 
LAW 5792  Sir; At a crisis so important as the pre-, 
LAW 5793 sent there needs no apology on the part of the London Corresponding Society,’ for addressing itself to all other associated societies, who have in view the same object as themselves. To the ‘ Society of the Friends of the “ People,’ arguments are not wanting to show the importance and absolute necessity of a full and fair representation of the people of Great Britain. They have investigated the subject for themselves; they have exposed to the world a series of plain and indisputable facts, which must excite in the mind of every man well disposed to his country, apprehensions of alarm for the security of the few remaining vestiges of liberty, from which, as Britons, we derive consolation. Deeply impressed with considerations of this nature, the London Corresponding Society earnestly solicits, at this time, tle concurrence and assistance of the Society of the Friends of the People, in assembling, as speedily as the nature of the business will admit, a Coavention of the Friends of Freedom, for the purpose of obtaining, in a legal and constitutional method, a full and effectual representation. 
LAW 5794 ‘ Our request is not made from the impressions of the moment, but after the maturcst deliberations on the value and importance of the object for which we are contending, and of the difficulties we may expect fram those whose present interests render them hostile to the welfare of their country. 
LAW 5795 he opposition of such persons is no small argument for the goodness of our cause ; and their late conduct when compared with their former professions, exhibits a depravity, leled, we trust, on the page of history. 
LAW 5796 “ Under the a ay of apostate reformers, we have lately beheld serious and alarming encroachments on the liberties of the people. 
LAW 5797 “ We have seen with indignation and horror men legally and peaceubly assembled, dispersed by unconstitutional powers, and: their papers seized. 
LAW 5798 “ We have scen some of our most virtuous brethren, whose only crime has been an imi. tation of Mr. Prrr and his associates, sentenced to fourteen years transportation, without the sanction of law or even of precedent, of which number, one was held up in the British parliament as convicted and condemned, before he was even put upon his trial. 
LAW 5799 he insidious attempts also to introduce forcign troops into this country, without the consent of parliament, and the intended bill to embody foreigners into his majesty’s service, are measures suthciently calculated to awaken our fears for the existence even of the name of liberty. Nor can we overlook that part of the present system of corupeih, which maintains out of the public plunder, train of spies, more dangerous to society than so many assassins, whose avowed business is to destroy the friends of the country, one by one, 
LAW 5800 “ These are grievances which demand im mediate redress, and when added to thos evils which are necessarily connected with every partial representation of the people, cs! for the strenuous exertions of every live Cs his country. 
LAW 5801 “ But we are told that the present is not the time for reform, and that innovation may introduce disturbance. Are those persons to judge of the proper time to make returm, who exist only by corruption? Are the people of Britain to endure every thing without repining, without ardently seeking a radical reform, because disturbances may happen? Have the enemies to reform told us whence these disturbances are to originate? Mas a single overt act been committed by the friends to freedom? Have not all the riots, all the public disturbances, all the seditious assem lies been excited by the enemies to reform? And do they mean to tell us that they will still find other instruments for their wicked designs ; that they have yet those who will act over avain the outrages that have been perpetrated in some parts of Britain, and attempted in others ? 
LAW 5802 f such is the determination of those persons hostile to a fair representation, et them look to the consequences, but let them recollect that it has happened, and may happen again, that those who kindled the flames have perished by them. 
LAW 5803 “ The friends to reform are friends to peace, their principles can be promoted only by peaceable means, they know of no other me thod of obtaining the object they desire. But they will not be alarmed by the threats ot venal apostates, they will not draw back because they have seen some of their best friends doomed to exile. They will pursue the course in which they have begun, and turn neither to the right nor to the left. 
LAW 5804 “ Convinced as the London Corresponding Society is, that as there is no power which ought, so there is no power which oan finally withstand the just and steady demands of 3 people resolved to be free ; they will thesefare look with confidence to the determination, and they hope to the co-operation of the ‘ Suciety of the Friends of the People, m the attainment of an object which involves the dearest interests of society. 
LAW 5805 “ Convinced also that their intentions are of the purest kind, they will never stoop to answer the calumnies of their enemies; but will at all times, and in all circumstances, endeavour, by firmness and perseverance, to deserve the countenance and approbation of the best friends of their country, the friends of a fair Representation of the People of Great Britain. —I am, sir, tor the London Corresponding Society, ‘THOMAS HARDY, Scc.

LAW 5807 “ COMMITTEE ROOM, 
LAW 5808 “ Frith-street, April t1, 1794. 
LAW 5809 s¢ Sir, Your letter of the 4th instant, addressed to Mr. Snertpan, chairman of: the FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE, was laid before that SOCIETY at their meeting on Saturday last; and they instructed their committee to thank the LONDON CORRESPONDING SOCIETY for their communication, and to express the alarm they feel in common with every Friend ot Liberty, at the late extraordinary proceedings of Government, so ably detailed, and so justly reprobated by your Society. They assure you that all the Friends of Reform, may ‘look with confidence “to the determination and co-operation’ of this society in every peaccable and constitutional measure, which shall appear to them calculated to promote the object of their institution; but they do not think that which is recommended in your letter, is likely to serve its professed purpose. ‘They fear it will furnish the Enemies of Reform with the means of calumniating its advocates, and so far from forwarding the cause, will deter many from eountenancing that which they approve. For these reasons, the Friends of the People must decline to send Delegates to the convention proposed by the London Corresponding Soeiety : at the same time they renew their assurances of good will, and desire of preserving a proper understanding and cordiality among all the Friends of Parliamentary Reform, notwithstanding any difference of opinion that may occur as to the best method ef accomplishing it
BAILEY 5810 In the name, and by order, of the committee, (Signed) “ W. BRETTON, chairman. «To Mr. T. Hardy, Secretary to the London Corresponding Seciety. 
LAW 5811 Was that letter from the Friends of the People read there 
BAILEY 5812 It was. 
LAW 5813 How was it received? — With universal silence, I believe; I do not recollect any approbation of it. “ Do you recollect any marks of the contrary 
BAILEY 5814  Yes, there was some few fell a hissing. a 
LAW 5815  The following RESOLUTIONS were then N passed Unanimously : 
LAW 5816 Resolved Unanimously,—1. That this society have beheld with rising indignation, prepemone’d to the enormity of the evil, the jate rapid advancesof despotism in Britain; the invasion of public security, the contempt of popular opinion, and the violation of all those provisions of the Constitution intended to protect ‘the People against the encroachments of Power and Dreetistive, ; 
LAW 5817 “2. That our abhorrence and detestation have been particularly called forth by the late arbitrary and flagitious proceedings of the Court of Justiciary-in Scotland, where all the doctrines and practices of the Star Chamber, in the times of Charles the 1st, Have ‘beer revived and aggravated ; and where sentences have been pronounced in open violation of all law and justice, which must strike deep into the heart of every man, the melancholy conviction that BriTons ARE NO LONGER FREE. 
LAW 5818 “3. That the whole proceedings of the late British Convention of the People at Edinburgh, are such as claim our approbation ana applause. 
LAW 5819 4, That the conduct of citizens Mancaror and Gerratop in particular, by its strict conformity with our wishes and instructions, and the ability, firmness, and disinterested triotism which it so eminently displayed, a inspired an enthusiasm of Zeal and Attachment which no time can obliterate, and no persecution remove; and that'we will preserve their names engraven on‘our hearts till we have an opportunity to redress theiy wrongs. 
LAW 5820 «5. That any attempt to violate those yet remaining laws, which were intended for the security of Englishmen against the Tyranny ot Courts and Ministers, and ‘the Corruption of dependent Judges, by vesting in such Judges a legislative or arbitrary power (such as has lately been exercised by the Court of Justiciary in Scotland) ought to be considered as dissolving entirely the social compact between the English nation and their Governors; and driving them to an immediate appeal to that incontrovertible maxim of eternal justice, that the safety of the people is the suPREME, and in cases of necessity, the ONLY law, 
LAW 5821 “6. That the arming and disciplining in this country, either with or without the consent of parliament, any bands of emigrants and foreigners, driven from their own country Jor their known attachment to an INFAMOUS DESPOTISM, is an outrageous attempt to orer awe and intimidate the free spirit of Britons; to subjugate them to an army of mercenary cut-throats, whose views and interest must of necessily be in direct opposition to those of the Nation, and that xo pretence whatever eucnt to induce the people to submit to so unconstitutional a measure. 
LAW 5822 “6. That the unconstitutional projevt of raising money and troops by forced benevo lences (and no benevolences collected upon fequisition from the king or his ministers can ever in reality be voluntary) and the equally unjustifiable measure of arming one part 0! the people against the other, brought Charles the first to the block, and drove James the second and his posterity from the throne; and that consequently ministers in advising such measures, ought to consider whether they are not guilty of high treason. 
LAW 5823 “8. That this society have beheld with’ 
LAW 5824 considerable pleasure the consistent respect which the House of Lords displayed for their own constitutional rules and orders, on the 4th of the present month, upon the motion of Earl Stanhope, concerning the interference of ministers in the internal government of France; and that it is the firm conviction of this society, that this circumstance when properly detailed, will have a considerable effect in convincing the country at large, of the true dignity and utility of that branch of HIS MAJESTY’s PARLIAMENT. -“9. That the thanks of this meeting be given to Eart Stanuore, for his manly and patriotic conduct during the present session of parliament ; a conduct whic! (ueeyperteal as at has been in the senate, of which ne is so truly. honourable a member) has, together with the timely interference of certain spirited and patriotic associations, been nevertheless already productive of the salutary effect of chasing the Hessian and Hanoverian Mercenaries from our coasts; who, but for these exertions, might have been marched perhaps, ere this, intu the very heart of the country, together with others of their countrymen, to have peopled the sarracxs, which every where insult the eyes of Britons. 
LAW 5825 “ 40. That it is the firm conviction of this society, that a steady perseverance in the same bold and energetic sentiments, which have lately been avowed by the Friends of Freedom, cannot fail of crowning with ultimate triumph, the virtuous cause in which we are engaged; since whatever may be the interested opinion of hereditary senators, or acked majorities of pretended representatives, tuth and Liberty, in an age soen lightened as the Present, must be Invincible and Omnipotent. 
LAW 5826 “ This Society having already addressed M. Margarot, their Delegate, an ADDRESS to JOSEPH GERRALD was read as follows, and carried unanimously. 
LAW 5827 o JOSEPH GERRALD, a prisoner senfenced by the High Court of Justiciary of Scotland, to Transportation d the Seas for FOURTEEN YEARS? 
LAW 5828 “ We behold in you our beloved and rewet friend and fellow-citizen, a Martyr to the Glorious Cause of Equal Representation, and we cannot permit you to leave this degraded country without expressing the infinite obligations the people at large, and we in particular, owe to you for your very spirited exer— tions m that cause upon every occasion ; but upon nene more conspicuously, than during fthe sitting of the Britis Convention of the
LAW 5829 PEOPLE at Edinburgh, and the consequent proceeding (we will not call it trial) at the ber of the Court of Justiciary. 
LAW 5830 “We know not which most deserves our admiration, the splendid talents with which you are so eminently distinguished, the exalted virtues by which they have been directed, the perseverance and undaunted firmness which you so nobly displayed in resisting the wrongs of your insulted and oppressed country, or your present manly and philosophical suffering under an arbitrary, and till of late unprecedented sentence: a sentence one of the most vindictive and cruel that has been pronounced since the days of that most infamous and ever-to-be-detested Court of Star-Chamber, the enormous tyranny of which cost the first Charles his head. 
LAW 5831 o you and your associates we feel ourselves most deeply indebted. For us it is that you are suffering the sentence of transportation with felons, the vilest outcasts af society! For us it is that you are doomed to the inhospitable shores of New Holland ; where, however, we doubt not you will experience considerable alleviation by the remembrance of that vinrvous conpuct for which it is imposed on you, and by the sincere regard and esteem of your fellow citizens. 
LAW 5832 “ The equal laws of this country have, for ages past, been the boast of its inhabitants; but whither are they now fled? We are animated by the same sentiments, are daily repeating the same words, and committing the same actions for which you are thus infamously sentenced ; and we will repeat and commit them until we have obtained redress; 
LAW 5833 et we are unpunished! either therefore the law is unjust towards you in inflicting Py nishment on the exertions of Virtue and Telents, or it ought not to deprive us of cur share in the story of the Martyrdom. 
LAW 5834 “ We again, therefore, pledge ourselves to you and to our country, never to cease demanding our rights from those who have usurped them, until having obtained an Equal Representation of the People, we shall be enabled to hail you once more with triumph to your native country. We wish you Health and Happiness; and be assured we never, never shall forget your Name, your Vir tues, nor YouR Great ExamPte.

LAW 5849 With whom did you go to this meeting 
BAILEY 5850 I went from a place in Store-street, Tottenham-court-road, a good part of the way with Mr. Thelwall. 
LAW 5851 How came you to know that the meeting was to be held at Chalk Farm? Had you any Teason to expect it to be held at any other place
BAILEY 5852 I had reason at first to believe it would be held in Store-street. 
LAW 5853 “ Was the change of place intimated to you 
BAILEY 5854 Not till after I gotto Store-street. 
LAW 5855 Who told you it was to be at Chalk Farm? Thelwall. 
LAW 5856 Did he tell you why it was given out to be held in Store-street 
BAILEY 5857 If I recollect right, he told me the reason given out of its being to be held in Store-strect was, an imagination of the magistracy interfering to prevent the Meeting. 
LAW 5858 Were there any written or printed papers giving notice at Store-street, informing persons the meeting would be held at Chalk Farm
BAILEY 5859 Yes, 8 written notice of it put upon the door, ;

BAILEY 5861 I cannot say. 
LAW 5862 Who were the principal persons who spoke and acted in that meeting

LAW 5864 Did Mr. Thelwall make a speech at thak meeting 
BAILEY 5865 Two or three. 
LAW 5866 Do you recollect any thing particular in either of those speeches respecting spies or informers 
BAILEY 5867 There was a clamour went round that there were spies and informers there; Mr. Thelwall was for admitting all spies and informers there, because the number of the members of the London Corresponding Society, could be no agreeable news to the minister. 
LAW 5868 Who read the resolutions
BAILEY 5869 I think Mr. Richter. 
LAW 5870 ‘Do you remember any objection being made to the words ‘ a British Senate,’ in one of those resolutions
BAILEY 5871 I think there was. 
LAW 5872 By whom was that objection made
BAILEY 5873 I cannot tell. 
LAW 5874 Do you recollect Mr. Thelwall saying any thing upon that subject
BAILEY 5875 As far as my belief goes, I can say, but no farther. 
LAW 5876 After that meeting was over, where did you adjourn to ; where did -you spend your evening; do you recollect any thing particular that Mr. Hardy said or did at that meeting
BAILEY 5877 I only recollect Mr. Hardy speaking three words: Mr. Richter was sg ond in the midst of his reading he stopt shart to make some observations of his own; Mr. Hardy, who stood below, said, looking up to him, ‘ read, Sir, without comment’; Lhat was all he said, and that is the whole I recollect of Mr. Hardy's saying afy thing at all.

BAILEY 5893 Mr. Thelwall. 
LAW 5894 Do you recollect any remarkable language used by Thelwall during supper, or incourse of that evening
BAILEY 5895 I heard something which very much astonished me. What was it?—Thelwall said, taking up 2 pot of porter in bis hand, which had been delivered him by some waiter or somebody, he blew off the head of the porter, and said this is the way I would have all kings served, or this is the way I would serve all kings, I know not which.

LAW 5902 Did he call upon any body else for another toast 
BAILEY 5903 He called upon somebody to cover it. 
LAW 5904 What was it covered with 
BAILEY 5905 Somebody, whom I know not, in the further end of the room, cried out, the ‘Treasury-bench. 
LAW 5906 Were those toasts drank by the persons then assembled 
BAILEY 5907 They were. 
LAW 5908 And the persons assembled consisted of members of that division of the Corresponding Society

BAILEY 5917 He once said to me that annual parliaments and universal suffrage were only ladders to obtain their ends, or words to that effect. 
LAW 5918 Was he of the same division with yourself
BAILEY 5919 He was. 
LAW 5920 Where was it
BAILEY 5921 In a place called the coffee-room, before you go into the division room. 
JURYMEMBER 5922 Was it that same evening you have been speaking off—No, I am not speaking of that same evening.

EYRE 5926 Was there any body else present, or was that a conversation between you two only 
BAILEY 5927 Between us two, there were several other people in the place called the cofice-room. 
EYRE 5928 Were they near enough to hear this conversation 
BAILEY 5929 I do not think any one was. 
LAW 5930 Did Green show you a knife of any particular construction
BAILEY 5931 I must explain that by something which happened previous toit. Atthe meeting at Chalk Farr, there was a kind af shed in which we were all sitting previous to the commencement of the business, and there was a bit of bread and cheese and some porter brought: . J. waa. sitting with halfa dozen or ten in the same box, and I was surprised by five or six of them pulling out little instruments exactly corresponding with each other. 
EYRE 5932 What sort of an instrument 
BAILEY 5933 I mean a sort of thing called a couteau secret, a French knife. 
LAW 5934 Describe the form of them, have you got one of them 
BAILEY 5935 I have nat. 
LAW 5936 Have you seen a French knife 
BAILEY 5937 Yes, there is a spring, so that when the blade is put out, unless you undo that spring it cannot close. 
LAW 5938 Were they fixed like a common case knife
BAILEY 5939 Exactly ; and unless the spring fails, the person cannot cut himself by its flying back. 
LAW 5940 You observed several of them with those knives
BAILEY 5941 I think five or six. 
LAW 5942 You do not recollect, I believe, who the persons were that were using themi—Yes, one. 
LAW 5943 Who was that
BAILEY 5944 His name was Pearce. 
LAW 5945 Having seen these knives when in company with Green, and he was making this dec tion, did you apply to him about a knife, or did he show you a knife of that same construction
BAILEY 5946 It was in consequence of the conversalion I learned; when I saw five or six of them with knives of the same description, an observation was made by one of the company that they were bread and cheese Fates, and upon that observation there was a smile; I looked upon them as harmless instruments certainly. 
LAW 5947 Did you learn from Green what number of these knives he had sold
BAILEY 5948 I asked where they were to be bought, and I was told I might get them of Mr. Green ; I asked where Mr. Green lived, they told me in Orangestreet; there was a man from Sheffeld in the box whose name I do not recollect, his person I well know. 
EYRE 5949 Did you know where Green lived at that time 
BAILEY 5950 I did not, I asked where they were to be bought; one of the company said at Mr. Green’s ; I asked where be lived; they said he was a perfumer andhair-dresser in Orange-street, Leicestetfields. 
EYRE 5951 Did you go to buy one
BAILEY 5952 In about a week after I did. 
EYRE 5953 Did you learn from Green what number of these knives he had sold 
BAILEY 5954 I think he said two or three hundred; Mr. Green told me to speak very low, for the parlour-door was open which was adjoining the shop, and he and said, for my wife is a damned aristocrat. 
EYRE 5955 Did you attend afterwards a meeting your division, which I think was No. 2, in Compton-street, on the 28th of April 
BAILEY 5956 I cannot recallect exactly the day, but I believe I attended regularly. 
EYRE 5957 Do you recollect ‘any observation made by Pearce, respecting those knives, and the use 
EYRE 5958 “and convenience of them
BAILEY 5959 At the meeting at Chalk-farm he did. What did he say about the convenience of these knives?—He said, if you strike with them they will not fly back, or words to that purpose. 
EYRE 5960 Pearce is a person whom you are sure you saw using one of these knives at Chalk-farm
BAILEY 5961 Iam very sure of that; there was a man from Shefheld, who found fault very much with the construction of these knives. 
EYRE 5962 What was the fault he found with them 
BAILEY 5963 That they were made in a bungling manner, that they were not equal to those made at Sheffield. 
EYRE 5964 Did he mention that there were man others of a similar construction made at Shelfield 
BAILEY 5965 He did. 
EYRE 5966 You say you do not recollect the day of the month 
BAILEY 5967 No. 
EYRE 5968 Were you present at any meeting, when any subscription was made for ddector Hodson
BAILEY 5969 Yes. 
EYRE 5970 Where was any subscription for this doctor Hodson proposed when you were present
BAILEY 5971 In the division. 
EYRE 5972 Do you recollect when that was
BAILEY 5973 I do not recollect the date of that. 
EYRE 5974  Was such a subscription proposed
BAILEY 5975 There was. 
EYRE 5976 Was any thing collected under that subscription 
BAILEY 5977 That I cannot say, I think to the contrary ; I think they said he had been relieved : I am bound to speak the truth, and therefore must certainly add this to it, that the application for relief was rejected on the und of the violence of that person's conduct, and I think there was another reason if my memory is right; he was not considered asa member of the London Corresponding Society. 
EYRE 5978 I believe you were present at the dinner at the Crown and Anchor-tavern, on the second of May 
BAILEY 5979 I was. 
EYRE 5980 Before I go to that, I will just ask you as to one meeting at an earlier period, the 25th of February 1794. Do you recollect bein present ata division-meeting, when any dress from Stockport was read 
BAILEY 5981 Yes. 
EYRE 5982 Have Mes that address about you
BAILEY 5983 I do not think I have. 
EYRE 5984 What day 
BAILEY 5985 In. the month of February. 
LAW 5986 Can you ascertain at what part of the month 
BAILEY 5987 No. 
LAW 5988 What was the number of your division 
BAILEY 5989  Number 2. 
LAW 5990 I thought tha: had been the number of the house 
BAILEY 5991 Number three was the number of the house, No. 2, the number of the division. 
LAW 5992 Look at that paper, and say, whether that is the paper that was read at the meeting in February last, at your division? —This paper I am very sure was delivered; I need not look at the contents, because there are my initials upon it. Itwasread] . “RIGHTS OF SWINE; “ An Address tothe Poor. Printed in the year 1794. “ Talso will show mine opinion. 
LAW 5993 a method founde to prevent the poor from wanting bread, be the state of trade whatever it ma are the ence? moulded into many shapes for the use of mai but chiefly into bread, which is the staff o life; and from grass, we derive our flesh milk, butter, cheese, &c. besides wool an leather, which, I think, with the addition 9 coal, and a few other mincrals nearly makeup the real necessaries of life. 
LAW 5994 “Ward indeed must be the heart which ig unaffected with the present distress experienced by the poor in general in this commers cial nation. Thousands of honest and industrious people in Great Britain are literally starving for want of bread; and the cause invariably assigned is a stagnant commerce, My opinion on this subject will perhaps ape pear to some a strange phenomena—it is, that a stagnant commerce is not the real cause of the want of the necessaries of life among the laborious poor. And I am confident, that, while the ‘ Earth lone her increase,’ there ig on Justice aud Reason, n the first place, then, I will ask, what rincipal sources of human subsist. Sertainly corn and grass. Corn ig ask again then, who is so infatuated ag to say, that the growing of corn or grass, ia dependent on, or connected with, the perity or adversity of trade? Certainly (thank Heaven!) they are not affected by the devouring sword, or ruined commerce (except at the. seat of war.)—Corn grows not in the loom, nor grass upon the anvil! Why isit, then, that while there is plenty of bread the poor are starving? Is there not as much grain in the land as when the trade fonsiabed? 
LAW 5995 pose trade were to rise immediately to an amazing degree, would it make one grain of corn or blade of grass? Certainly not. Why then, I ask again, are the poor, who are the

LAW 5998 “ The following reasons are at least satisfactory to myself : Because, in the time of national prosperity, house and land rent (consequently provisions) are always raised by the, wealthy and voluptuous, till they are, at least, at par with high wages; but, when Waa, or. any other cause, has ruined or impeded commerce, and reduced sues penis and provia sions remain unabated. The poor callicoweavers in the vicinity af Manchester, notoriously illustrate thig argument, as they are now (they who can get any) working for fifty and sixty per cent. less wageathan at this time twa years back, and the necessaries of life are, rather augmented in their prices than dimir nished!! : 
LAW 5999 “ Hearken, O ye poor of the Land! While great men have an unbounded power to raise their rents and your provisiona, and, at the same time, an uncontrolled power to make War, and consequently to dry up, or diminish, the sources of your income, your subsistence will, at tha beat, be precerjaus, and your very existence often miserable !—The present want of bread amongst the poor, is not owing to the want of grain in the world, nor, I presume, in this land, but owing to the price of it being excessively above the price of labour. When, therefore, the price of labour cannot be brought up to the rate of provisions, provisions should be reduced to the rate of labour. Till this is practicable, the poor are miserable ! 
LAW 6000 During the last twenty years, mechanical wages have been varied, according to circumstances, several times, and not unusually in some branches, twenty, thirty, forty, and even fifty per cent

But, with regard to lund-rent, its variations have always heen progressive ; and to find a single instance to the contrary, would be almost, if not altogether, impossible ! t requires but little sagacity to see, that the Game Laws, Riot-act, Laws against Vagrants and Felons, &c. &c. are made chiefly for the sccurity of the rich against the depredations of the poor. But what security have the poor against the oppression and extortion of the rich? Certainly none at all. As every comfort of life is derived from land, and as the rich are the proprietors thereof, it may in some sense be said, that they hold the issues of life and death; and, whilst they can, uninterruptedly, raise their rents without Fimitation or restraint, they have an alarming and unbounded power over, not only the happiness, but even the lives of the great mass of the people—the poor “If, then, statesmen have a right to advance their lands in times of prosperity, the poor ought to have a parliament of their own choosing, invested with power to reduce them in days of adversity. pers between the rick and the poor, would productive of a thousand times more consolation to this nation, than the chimerical ftionsense of court jugglers, ‘the balance of power in Europe. Nor can I imagine that any judicious person would call such a power in parliament unjust or irrational, which, when exercised, could ruin none, but bless tnillions! If it would be cruel to make a statesman of twenty thousand pounds per annum, live a year or two upon ten thousand; how much more remorseless is it, to make the Spitalfield and Norwich weavers, as well as some hundred thousands more, live upon nothing—or, what is little better, upon charity!!! Besides, it is a curious truth, that the very article which ruins hundreds of the voluptuous great, would render happy the innumerable unhappy part of mankind ! Great Gop!

BAILEY 6090 I will; some time after dinner Mr. Horne Tooke got up, and silence was called, and he refaced his address by an observation that, f believe, one out of fifty in that room might be considered as a government spy, and to them he wished particularly to address himself; and, in consequence of that address, I must confess I did attend; in consequence of his addressing himself to goyernment spies, I certainly did attend to what he said; for my idea of a spy and informer may differ particularly in a business of this nature. 
LAW 6091 To the best of your recollection, what was it Mr. Horne Tooke delivered in that address
BAILEY 6092 He begged the company to take notice, that fhe was not in a state of inebriation; for having something to say to the company, he had taken care to refrain from his glass; and for fear of being mistaken, and being taken tp be in a state of intoxication, he begged every body present to take particular notice of what he said; he called the parliament a scoundrel sink of corruption; he called the opposition in parliament a scoundrel sink of opposition ; he said, that there was a junction between those two scoundrel ies, formed for the purpose of destroying the rights and Liberties of the country; he began to speak about the hereditary nobility; he asked, if that skip-jack, Jenkinson, could be considered as one of the hereditary nobility of the country; and I think, if my memory is right, that he paid the same compliment to the House of Lords that he did to the House of Commons.

UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6143 No. 
GIBBS 6144 When I asked if you were a solicitor, and you asked if I meant in Chancery, I told you T did not mean in Chancery 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6145 I thought you meant a solicitor in Chancery. 
GIBBS 6146 And you really did not know the meaning of my question

GIBBS 6160 Mr. Groves
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6161 If it isa fair question I will answer it directly. 
EYRE 6162 There can be no imputation upon you for answering the question ; if you decline answering, that is another thing ; it exposes you to no difficulties, or penalty, or any thing of that sort. None; it is only a point of delicacy. I am ready to give an answer, I have not the least objection on my part. 
LAW 6163 My lord, I take it that the channels for information must be protected. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6164 The court of exchequer never would permit that question to be asked. 
EYRE 6165 Upon a general principle I do not know whether it ought to e answered. 
EYRE 6166 Mr. Groves
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6167 It was a person high in office under his majesty; but permit me to add, I was not desired by that gentleman to conceal his name.

EYRE 6169 He has said what is proper and material for your purpose : that is, that he went there, being employed for the purpose of collecting information, with a view to the disclosure of it. 
GIBBS 6170 I will not press the question farther than your lordship thinks I ought--T leave it to the discretion of the Court if it is thought not proper. 
EYRE 6171 I do not think it is proper. 
GIBBS 6172 Then you were desired by a rson, high in office, to go to this place, how arose your connexion with that gentleman 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6173 My connexion with that gentleman has been for these ten years ; that is so far as having the honour of being personally known to him.

EYRE 6175 It is hardly proie that the history of a connexion of that ind should be disclosed here. 
EYRE 6176 Groces
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6177 Thatgentleman would not emloy me in any thing dishonourable, nor would accept it. 
GIBBS 6178 I dare say you would not. 
EYRE 6179 You find he went on purpose togive information of what passed ; that is the only fact that is material for the prisoner; the rest is private intercourse, which may involve in it the consideration of a thousand other things, which may be material to the government ofthe country. I think it not proper to be disclosed here, itis not necessary to the cause. 
EYRE 6180 Mr. Groves
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6181 I have had the honour of his confidence ever since I have known him, 
GIBBS 6182 Then trusting in you, he sent you to the Globe-tavern on the 20th of January, 1794 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6183 Certainly. 
GIBBS 6184 Then you never were at any of those meetcall it so, I will take it so. 
GIBBS 6185 If you were not there as a spy, take any title vou choose for yourself, and I will give you that. 
LAW 6186 He did not state any title. 
GIBBS 6187 I did not desire you to take any title in the sense that gentleman is using the term ; you object to the term spy, as I called you, and I bid you take any other naine. 
EYRE 6188 There should be no name given to a witness on his examination: he states what he went for, and in making observations on the evidence, you may give it any appellation you please. You recollect I made the observation before, when Mr. Erskine did the same thing. 
GIBBS 6189 I really did not feel that I was going atall out of the way in the cross-examination of a witness, in walling him by a name which suits his character, though he does not like it. 
EYRE 6190 Go on. 
GIBBS 6191 You went then (not to call you a spy) to these meetings in the character of a person who had nootherreason for going there, than that of picking up what information you could, and carrying it again to those employers, in whose conhilesiee you were 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6192 Certainly. 
GIBBS 6193 Then I must express your employment hy that periphrasis. You said there was a greut assembly there 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6194 There was. 
GIBBS 6195 There wasa considerable meeting you said, and universal suffrage and annual parliaments were talked of ? 
GIBBS 6196 Pt —Which meeting do you speak of? 
GIBBS 6197 I am speaking of the meeting to which you first went —There was a very large meeting, so much so that the floor broke down. 
GIBBS 6198 You have been giving an account of some conversation that passed there; cannot you recollect who the persons were that had that conversation
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6199 Noy, I do not know; there was an universal conversation. 
GIBBS 6200 You going there for the purpose of collecting evidence against individuals, and coming now to give evidence againstan individual, vou thought it not material to observe who the people were who then used this language— You, a gentleman used to practise at the Old Bailey, and meaning to give evidence afterwards against those persons, did not think it material to learn by whom these cunversations were held? 
EYRE 6201 Mr. Gibbs, Iam sorry to interrupt you, but your cuestions ought not to be accomp:nied with those sort of comments: they are the proper sulyects of observation when the defence is made. The business of a cross-examination is to ask to all sorts of acts, to probe a wilness as closely as you can ; but it is not the object of a cross-examination, to introduce that kind of periphrasis as you have just done. 
EYRE 6202 sc 
GIBBS 6203 Send to Mr. Erskine, he is in the parlour. 
ERSKINE 6204 Will your lordship give me Jeave to say, it is the universal practice of the Court of King’s-bench, the first criminal court in this country, in which I have had the honour to practise for seventeen years, We are certainly permitted to go as far as this. I agree with your lordship in what you just now said (and it will be of no consequence whether I did or no, because your lordship must give the rule) but what I take my learned friend to have said to the witness, is this: you, sir, not Meaning itas an insult tothe witness, but you, sir, as a practiser at the Old Bailey, must know the necessity, if you go to any place to get evidence, of having proper materials for that evidence ; how do you account for not having done that? Ina cross-examination, counsel are not called upon to be so exact as in an original examination, You are permitted to lead a witness. 
GIBBS 6205 I desired Mr. Erskine to be sent for into court, as I wished to have the testimony of a gentleman who has practised in that court more than any man now present, that I was not departing from the practice which has obtained there, My end is now answered in desiring Mr. Erskine to come into court. 
ERSKINE 6206 I can appeal to one of the learned judges now upon the bench. I remeniber that when Mr. Garrow first came to the situation, which undoubtedly he fills with a great deal of ability, I ohjected to a question he put on a cross-examination, and when it turncd out that it was upon cross-examination, the Jaugh was turned against me, and I had nothing to say. 
BULLER 6207 Undoubtedly the practice has increased much within my memory : what Mr. Erskine alludes-to now has been universally the practice; that when you are upon a cross-cxamination, you are permitted to lead a witness more than you can on an ori- ! 
BULLER 6208 inal examination ; but he so good as recolect the mode in which the lord chief justice put it yesterday, and Ido notthink in Guildhall, orany where else, you cver departed from that. You may Icad a witness upon a cross-examination to bring him directly to the point as to the answer; but not to go the length as was attempted yesterday, of putting the very words into a witness’s mouth, which he was to echo back again. 
ERSKINE 6209 Having done that yesterday, I immediately bowed to the admonition I received from my Lord Chief Justice. 
EYRE 6210 I should be extremely sorry if it should be supposed that I mean to make an observation that seemed to press personally upon either of the learned counsel who are now for the defendant, and particularly on the gentleman who is now cross-examining this witness, and more particularly if it were supposed I was capable of doing that in the absence of the other counsel; I hope that will never be imagined of me. 
EYRE 6211 With regard to the point, I think itis so clear that the questions that are put are not to be loaded with all the observations that arise upon all the previous parts of the case, they tend so to distract the attention of every bods, they load us in point of time so much, and that that is not the time for observation upon the character and situation of a witness is s6 apparent, that as a rule of evidence it ought never to be departed trom ; but it is certainly true that it dues slide into examinations, and that it is very often not taken notice of, and it saves more time frequently to let it pass than to take notice of it; but there is a rule to which all those sort of things, if once an appeal is made to the Court, ought to be brought, and my judgment is, that after you have got the particular facts upon which that sort of observation is founded, the examination ought to preed to the other facts upon the case, and the observations upon those furmer facts ought to make part of the defence. 
GIBBS 6212 My reason for sending for Mr. Erskine was because I knew it had been the practice, and I think I have observed it m the course of this cause on the other side. What Mr. Justice Buller has said, that it isa Practice that has gene on toa greater length than it ought, I hope, will be an excuse tor me, because I am more inexperienced in the profession than Mr. Erskine or Mr. Garrow. If that mode of examination prevails on one side, especially against a defendant. 
EYRE 6213 I will never suffer it to prevail on either side; but as far asf would indulge it, it should be on the part of s defendant. 
GIBBS 6214 Your lordship does not suI trust, than I sent for Mr. Erskine with any other view than I have mentioned, I coafess I feel myself sensibly mortified. 
GIBBS 6215 Lord Chief justice Eyre
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6216 I am extremely sorry for it, I never wished to mortify you. 
GIBBS 6217 I think you told me thet you were a gentleman who practised at the Ud Bailey, 3 you now practise here, or have you lett off that practice 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6218 I have not left it off. 
GIBBS 6219 You now practise at the Old Bailey
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6220 I have not for some time. 
GIBBS 6221 How happens that 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6222 Not this six months. 
GIBBS 6223 Your reason for not having practised is, that no business has been brought to you, I presume 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6224 Certainly, you are right there. 
GIBBS 6225 Did you or not think it necessary, at Meeting, to attend to the particular persoms from whom the conversation that you are now stating, proceeded 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6226 At that time I was a total stranger almost to every one in the room. 
GIBBS 6227 You did not endeavour to distinguish what was said by one man from what was said by ancther
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6228 I did not in conversation. 
GIBBS 6229 You say the language was universal sufand anoual parliaments 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6230 Yes. an you tell me who used that language ?—I cannot, it was the gencral language. 
GIBBS 6231 Who used it you cannot tell
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6232 No I cannot. 
GIBBS 6233 Tlow many people might there be there 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6234  as many as the room could contain, and it was a large room; I should suppose if I said four hundred people, I should speak within bounds. 
GIBBS 6235 You cannot recollect any one particular person who held this language you have been speakiug of 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6236 I cannot: we were in two rooms there; the first room we were in broke down, which occasioned us to go up stairs. 
GIBBS 6237 You were afterwards at Chalk-farm, I think you say 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6238 I was. 
GIBBS 6239 Tbere you went under the same employment, and for the same person 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6240 Exactly so. 
GIBBS 6241 You seem to have fixed yourselfa good deal upon Mr. Thelwall 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6242 No, Mr. Thelwall fixed himself upog me, 
GIBBS 6243 It was involuntary then
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6244 Quite so, for st that time I hardly knew Mr. Thelwall. 
GIBBS 6245 You would rather have declined it !— No, I did not say that; that is going too far; he and I were standing at the door, in Storestreet, together, when there were not above ten or a dozen people there, and then the paper being stuck up, that the meeting would held at Chalk Farm, he said, “ come eng. 
GIBBS 6246 Was that the first time you had conversed with him
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6247 I had conversed with him se. veral times. 
GIBBS 6248 Did he know who you were 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6249 I do not believe he did. 
GIBBS 6250 He had no previous knowledge of you 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6251 H e had none of me, nor I of him. 
GIBBS 6252 Had ‘ae any introduction to him 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6253 None. 
GIBBS 6254 You had yo previous knowledge of him, nor he of you, no introduction to him, no common friend who told each that he might trust the other 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6255 No, I do not recollect that ever such conversation passed between me and any man in the world. 
GIBBS 6256 But all this that he said to you was voluntary
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6257 What passed between him and me was in going to Chalk-farm, which was the first time in my life I ever spoke to him; it was voluntary. 
GIBBS 6258 I think you say that at Chalk-farm there was aclamour that spies were there 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6259 Cery. , And Mr. Thelwall was for admitting them ?—He was, and desired them to hear; 
GIBBS 6260 snd, I believe, I may add something further, now you have brought it tg my, recollection : 
GIBBS 6261 hesaid, it would give the minister the power of te ging of their proceedings and their num13, 
GIBBS 6262 You said so before. I believe you yourself made this cry against spies, did not you? you said you thought there were spies 
GIBBS 6263 Smong them
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6264 O yes! I did say that, and thought myself very justifiable in so doing. 
GIBBS 6265 Yes, yes, that was a scheme you had learned in your practice certainly; you were the person then who suggested that there were spics from the Treasury there 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6266 No, I was not; there was a person present, was asked if I knew him; I said, yes, I did. 
GIBBS 6267 Did you say you knew him to be a spy
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6268 I was asked who he was, and what he was, and I said, I did think he was a person employed by government. 
GIBBS 6269 Who was he
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6270 IIis name was Walsh, 
GIBBS 6271 And you seeing Mr. Walsh there, said, you thought he was a person employed by governiment
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6272 I was applied to by several to know whether it was not Mr. Walsh; I said, it was, and that I believed he had some employment about government; and I believed Mr. Walsh did not wish to conceal it, for upon his buttons there was, I believe, the King and Constitution, so that he did not wish to conceal it. 
GIBBS 6273 Because Mr. Walsh came there with King and Constitution upon his buttons, you chose to say that you thought he was a spy, was that so
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6274 That was not the reason, because he had the King and Constitution upon his buttons, for that might have been put on. 
GIBBS 6275 Well, seeing him there with King and Constitution on his buttons, you chose to say that you thought he was a spy from the Treasury 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6276 No. 
GIBBS 6277 Then do tell me how the fact is
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6278 The fact is, I was applied to by two or three to know ifI knew Mr. Walsh, I said yes, and he was pointed out to me; I said that is Mr. Walsh, certainly; somebody made answer, who I cannot say, he is just come from Ireland, where he has becn upon soine government. business; I was asked if I knew any thing of his being employed by government, I said immediately, I do believe he is. 
GIBBS 6279 Did not you me hiey believed he was a spy
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6280 I do not think I did 
GIBBS 6281 Will you swear you did not say, that you believed he was a spy
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6282 By my saying that I believed he was employed by government,Imeant to say, that he was a spy. 
GIBBS 6283 Then you do consider that the term spy, is to be applied to those employed by government
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6284 If you take it by implication that a, man employed by government Isa spy, it is so. 
GIBBS 6285 No; itis your own interpretation of the words 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6286 Then you have it that way, I confess it so far. 
GIBBS 6287 Then you did say you thought he was a spy 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6288 Yes, so far as giving information. 
GIBBS 6289 tt wasafter that, that Mr. Thelwall said he was for admitting all spies 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6290 Certainly, Mr. Thelwall did say so. 
GIBBS 6291 This was a very large mceting, was not it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6292 It was large. 
GIBBS 6293 Had you no apprehension for your friend, Mr. Walsh, saying, you thought he was a spy, at such a mecting 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6294 Ie is no friend of mine. 
GIBBS 6295 He was nota man, I suppose, whom you wished to have torn to picccs 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6296 No, nor any man in the world. 
GIBBS 6297 Were not you a little apprehensive of holding him out asa spy, a man youknew nothing ot
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6298 No; Iwas for admitting all spies too, and to let them remain there unmolested. 
GIBBS 6299 But though you might be for letting spies, that were there, continue, I want to know why you pointed out a particular man as a spy 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6300 I did not pvint out a particular man, I was applied toif I knew him, and I was taken to one end of the garden to look at him, and I said that is Mr. Walsh, certainly. 
GIBBS 6301 Did not you say you believed he was employed by government 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6302 I did. 
GIBBS 6303 Employed by government to be there
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6304 I did not say that. 
GIBBS 6305 But was not that your meaning
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6306 I did mean that. 
GIBBS 6307 Then why are you fencing with me
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6308 I am not fencing. 
GIBBS 6309 You represented him to be a man sent there by government, in the same way as yourself
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6310 Yes, 
GIBBS 6311 What induced you to point out this man
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6312 I was desired to point him out. 
GIBBS 6313 Did you believe him tobe so 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6314 I did. 
GIBBS 6315 I want to know whether you, going there, as what you call yourself, a spy, how you came to point out to the people, that were there, another person whom you also believed to be a spy
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6316 There was good reason for that, because, it I had not said he was sent there as aspy, I should have been suspected myself: the fact was too notorious to be denied, and if Mr. Walsh was here he would not deny it. 
GIBBS 6317 With King and Constitution upon his buttons 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6318 I think there was at that time. 
GIBBS 6319 What number of people do you think were there at this time 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6320 I should think between two and three thousand; there was a vast number, I believe, that were there out of curiosity, but, as far as I am able to judge, there were not above eight or nine hundred of the London Corresponding Society there. 
GIBBS 6321 You say, that sitting down to eat some bread and cheese, there was something that you called little instruments taken out, and it turned out that these were French knives 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6322 Y es, in the shape of French knives, made in this country I presume, as many of them are, 
GIBBS 6323 I know they are very common things 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6324 A s common as any thing certainly, and I belicve a great many people use them for safety to their hands. 
GIBBS 6325 You went to Mr. Green’s in Orange-street, you say 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6326 Yes. 
GIBBS 6327 He told you he had sold two or three hundred of these, but told you to speak very low as the parlour-door was open, and his wife was a damned Aristocrat 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6328 Ile certainly used those words. 
GIBBS 6329 You are positive to those particular words, that he said his wife was a damned Aristocrat
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6330 I am, and we both of us laughed. 
GIBBS 6331 What did you laugh at
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6332 At the lady’s being an Aristocrat. 
GIBBS 6333 I think you told me you were at the dinner on ie 2d of May, at the Crown and Anchor? —165. 
GIBBS 6334 How many people might there be there
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6335 I I should think there must be five hundred in all. 
GIBBS 6336 You went there in the same character, I suppose 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6337 Assuredly. 
GIBBS 6338 You say there was some piece of news brought, a newspaper brought in 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6339 I do not know whether a newspaper was brought in, but there were accounts brought in that some of the Allied Powers had received a very great check. 
GIBBS 6340 You do not know whether there was any newspaper brought in
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6341 I do not; I must add this, that I was very much surprised indeed when I went into the Constitutional Society, I there saw a number of most respectable gentlemen. 
GIBBS 6342 Then at this meeting that you are speaking of, there were a number of very respectable gentlemen 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6343 Indeed there were. 
GIBBS 6344 How did you get there
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6345 I have told you by a ticket Mr. Hardy brought to me; I offered to pay for it, he said they were not to be paid for. 
GIBBS 6346 What number did this meeting consist of
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6347 I dare say near five hundred;Ithink three hundred and fifty or four hundred sat down to dinner. 
GIBBS 6348 You are not sure, I think you say, who was in the chair 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6349 I am not, but if I may a sume to think upon the subject, it was Mr. Wharton, 
GIBBS 6350 You must not presume to think 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6351 Then I am not certain, and I will give you the reason; we went into the room, and there was a little bustle, and who was put into the chair I cannot say, butI consider Mr. Wharton to be inthe chair; but whether it was him or Mr. Horne Tooke, I cannot tell. 
GIBBS 6352 Whichever it was, I suppose he sat at the head of the table
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6353 There was a row all along, and they sat at the head of the table. 
GIBBS 6354 Then I think you say Mr. Tooke madea speech, in which he reflected upon the House of Commons 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6355 Yes. 
GIBBS 6356 You say he called the House of Commons a sink of corruption 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6357 He called the House of Commons a scoundrel sink of corruption. 
GIBBS 6358 He spoke of there being a junction between the two parties 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6359 He called them a scoundrel opposition, 
GIBBS 6360 I do not want you to repeat any offensive expressions that he used against individuals, but I think in speaking against the hereditary nobility, he spoke generally of a particular person 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6361 He did, and he spoke of more than one. 
GIBBS 6362 I believe he spoke highly of the hereditary nobility of the country 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6363 He did. 
GIBBS 6364 He spoke highly of the hereditary nobility of the country as contra-distinguished from adventurers
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6365 Most assuredly, he paid the hereditary nobility of the country every compliment that'a man could pay. 
GIBBS 6366 I believe he observed, likewise, that this hereditary nobility, of whom he spoke so high, had lost their influence in the state, by the introduction of adventurers
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6367 I do not know that the word adventurers was made use of. 
GIBBS 6368 By the introduction of those then who were not the hereditary nobility? —The new nobility. 
GIBBS 6369 He had before been declaiming against the House of Commons, certainly, using an imProper expression, however, calling them a sink of corruption 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6370 Yes. 
GIBBS 6371 Did he not say, likewise, that those new nobility were introduced into the House of Lords by means of those people whose conduct he was finding fault with in the House of Commons 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6372 I think his sense was the same ; T have no hesitation to say that his sense was the same. 
GIBBS 6373 Did he not also speak highly of the office of the King in the Constitution 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6374 I am very clear he did, because he said, that the newmade peers, or those lately introduced into the House of Lords, either had combined, or were combining for the purpose of amusing that poor man, the king. 
GIBBS 6375 Did he not mention it as matter of complaint, that the king had lost his due weight In the constitution, by means of this corruption that he had been complaining of before 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6376 I understood him completely so; I do not know one word that Mr. Horne Tooke said disrespectful to his majesty. 
GIBBS 6377 Did he hold out any thing as matter of complaint in the now existing constitution, except that there was a sort of people introduced into the House of Commons whom he disapproved of; and by their means likewise asort of persons introduced into the House of Peers, whom he disapproved of; and that they, acting together, restrained the due power of the crown 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6378 I believe that was the object of all his conversation. 
GIBBS 6379 Mr. John Gurnell called again. 
GIBBS 6380 Where did you find that paper
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6381 In Mr. Hardy’s house. 
GIBBS 6382 “ Tune, Vicar of Bray. “ e Why should we vainly waste our prime, “ Repeating our oppressions ? 
GIBBS 6383 “ Come rouse to arms, ’tis now the time o punish past transgressions. 
GIBBS 6384 is said that Kings can do no wrong; Their murd’rous deeds deny it ;

ERSKINE 6404 If the jury will look at the back of it, they will see this song was sent in a letter to Mr. Hardy by somebody or other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6405 Did you find any thing in the possession of a person of the name of Hillier 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6406 I did. When ?—On Monday the 19th of May. Produce it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6407 You told us yesterday that you were at Edinburgh when the Scotch convention sat and was dispersed 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6408 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6409 You knew Maurice Margarot, did not you
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6410 Yes, I saw him in the Tolbooth, in Edinburgh. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6411 Did you ever see any knife in his hand 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6412 I saw one laid upon the table, which Margarot said was his. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6413 Describe that knife.—It appeared to bea knife that opened with a spring between the haft and the blade: the knife and blade altogether was nine or ten inches long. — Was it easy or difficult to shut when it was once opened 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6414 It was very hard to shut; I could not shut it myself. 
ERSKINE 6415  Are you a Sheffield man 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6416 Yes, 
ERSKINE 6417 ‘ot, did not you? ‘olbooth, in Edin 
ERSKINE 6418 Had you ever seen any knife of this description 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6419 No. 
ERSKINE 6420 Had any body else a knife of this sort — No. 
ERSKINE 6421 Was any thing said about it at this time 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6422 No. 
ERSKINE 6423 Was it concealed 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6424 No, it was laid for him to get his dinner with. 
ERSKINE 6425 Then Margarot did not make any secret of this knife 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6426 No. 
ERSKINE 6427 How many peuple were present in all
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6428 There might be about six or seven. 
ERSKINE 6429 Did it strike you at the time that there was any thing wrong in it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6430 No, I did not apprehend any thing of danger in the knife when J saw it, only it was a curious knife, and he showed it to me upon the table. 
ERSKINE 6431 Publicly 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6432 Yes. 
ERSKINE 6433 Are you a cutler
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6434 No, an ink-stand maker, 
ERSKINE 6435  Was this at the time the Convention was holding at Edinburgh 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6436 No, afterwards; he was then in the Tolbooth. 
ERSKINE 6437 And he ate his dinner with it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6438 Yes. 
BOWER 6439 Were you at any time a member of the London Corresponding Society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6440 Yes. 
BOWER 6441 At what time did you become a member of the London Corresponding Society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6442 In October, 1792. 
BOWER 6443 ‘Where did you first see any division of the Lotdon Corresponding Society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6444 At the sign of the Mansion- house, opposite to the Mansion- house. Which of the divisions of the London Corresponding Society met at that house ?—The division No. 12. 
BOWER 6445 When you went first into the room, did you Teceive any paper of any kind 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6446 Yes. 
BOWER 6447 What was the paper you received upon ing into the room 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6448 It was the Rules of the ondon Corresponding Society, and the London Corresponding Society's Address. 
EYRE 6449 What date has that address 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6450 I do not immediately recolfect; but if one was handed to me, I could recognise it; but I think it is in March, 1792, 
EYRE 6451 Is this one of the papers
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6452 It isa larger pamphlet than that. 
EYRE 6453 Upon receiving that paper, did you give any intimation of any kind to the master of the house
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6454 Yes; I told him I believed it was a societ; : ‘ 
EYRE 6455 In fact you intimated, that there would be Ganger there; then in consequence of some Matimation, no matter what, that you pave to the master of the house, was that division of the society ad ooied to any other place
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6456 It was adjourned the next evening to the Crown, in Newgate- street. 
EYRE 6457 Did you attend at that meeting 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6458 I did. 
EYRE 6459 Was it there that you were accepted a member 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6460 It was. 
EYRE 6461 Did you become a member of that division that night 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6462 I did. 
EYRE 6463 Was the prisoner, Hardy, a member of the same division of the London Corresponding Society that you were admitted a member of
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6464 No, he was not; he did not belong to that division, but he belonged to the society. 
EYRE 6465 Were you present at any time afterwards at any other division 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6466 I was. 
EYRE 6467 Where was that, and what was the number of the division 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6468 I beg leave to look at my minutes that I made from time to time. 
EYRE 6469 Did you make these minutes at the times to which they respectively refer 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6470 Yes, I did. 
EYRE 6471 Then you may refresh your memory bv them. What was the next meeting at whic’ you were present
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6472 The next meeting I attended was at the sign of the Unicorn, in Covent-garden on the 29th of October. 
EYRE 6473 How many persons might be present at that meeting
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6474 I cannot exactly say; but there was a very large company; the room was full; there might be about seventy or eighty people. 
EYRE 6475 as the prisoner at the bar one of them
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6476 Yes. we 
EYRE 6477 In what character did the prisoner appear there 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6478 As secretary, I understood. 
EYRE 6479 Who were the delegates at that meeting 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6480 Being a young member at that time, I had not made myself informed: of the names of the delegates, nor the-oumber of the divisions. 
EYRE 6481 Was this a commitee of delegates 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6482 This was a meeting of the division, No. 2. 
BOWER 6483 Did Mr. Hardy, while you were there, take any part and what? were any reports made by any body 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6484 There was brought forward at that time Tom Paine’s Address to the French People, and it was voted to be published and delivered to all the divisions. 
BOWER 6485 Was any thing more said or done at that meeting 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6486 Yes. 
BOWER 6487 By whom 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6488 I don’t know that. 
BOWER 6489 hat was done next 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6490 Tom Paine’s Letter to the People of France, already published, to be delivered out, and the i and Duties of Man to be continued weekly. 
BOWER 6491 Are these minutes of resolutions that were passed that night
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6492 Yes; the delegates had received letters from the Manchester and Sheffield Societies, approving of the Londap Corresponding Society’s Address to the French Convention, Reported that two thousand and upwards had signed it at Norwich. The Ctown and Anchor approve of it, but would send one of their own ; thinking the more addresses that were sent to the Convention the better. 
BOWER 6493 Who were present besides the prisoner 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6494 A great many. 
BOWER 6495 Who communicated the letter from the Manchester society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6496 The mode of conducting the divisions is thus: the delegate of the division attends the business that has been transacted at the committee of delegates, and he makesa report of what letters and what resolutions were brought forward and agreed to. 
BOWER 6497 That was the mode of doing the business
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6498 Yes. 
BOWER 6499 Was there any thing more passed at that meeting 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6500 That seems to be all that I have made any memorandum of. 
BOWER 6501 Do you recollect any thing more, or do you not
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6502 That is all I recollect at that meeting. 
BOWER 6503 Who made that report that you have been speaking of at the last meeting 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6504 I cannot charge my recollection who it was, and therefore I would not speak. The next meeting was of the division, No. 12, at the Crown, in Newgatc-street, on the 31st of October. 
BOWER 6505 Who was present at that meeting 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6506 Mr. Hardy was not present. 
BOWER 6507 What was done at that meeting 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6508 At that meeting the address to the French Convention was reported by the delegate that was brought forward on the 27th of September at the Unicorn. 
BOWER 6509 Did any thing more pass there
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6510 I have made a remark of nothing more than that; 7 fancy there was nothing of any consequence. The next meeting was at the Rainbow, in Fleet-street, on the 2nd of November. 
EYRE 6511 What division was that 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6512 I have not got the number of the division, and I do not immediately recollect it. 
EYRE 6513 It was not your own division, No. 12
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6514 No, number 12 was the division I entered into; it was not that, but another division; tothe best of my recollection it was No. 11. 
BOWER 6515 Did any thing material pass at that meeting 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6516 The delegate reported, that the company at Stockport had wrote to Sheffield of their approbation of the different meetings. The editor of the Sheffield paper wrote to the delegates, that it would be a good plan to send London delegates down to teach the farmers politics. A letter from a Meeting just formed at Nottingham, addressed to the delegates—I am inclined to think that letter was not read. The next report was, that there were six honorary members admitted at the Crown and Anchor. 
BOWER 6517 Admitted to the Constitutional Society, do you mean 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6518 Yes; that is the whole of that Meeting. The next, division, No. 12, at the 
BOWER 6519 Crown, Newgate-street, November the 14th. 
BOWER 6520 I will prove by the paper in my hand, that Mr. Hardy was the delegate of division, No. 2; because your lordships will have a goud deal of evidence of what passed in the division of which he was a delegate. 
EYRE 6521 You said you did not know who was the delegate 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6522 I will not take upon myself to be certain, but believe Ishould be right if I said that Mr. Hardy was delegate at that time, for that division. 
BOWER 6523 Did you find that ever sow ing it to the witness] among Mr. Hardy’s papers 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6524 I found it in Mr. Hardy’s house, 
BOWER 6525 Alerunder Grant
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6526 I believe that is Mr. Hardy’s hand-writing. 
BOWER 6527  London Corresponding Society, at the Unicorn, Covent-Garden, Monday, October 1, 1792. 
BOWER 6528 “ Resolved, That Thomas Hardy, division No. 2. be appointed our delegate to the standing committee of the several divisions, and to continue in office for three months. 
BOWER 6529 (Signed) “ Atexanvrer Lownie, chairman. 
BOWER 6530 Indorsed, “ Division No. 2, delegate, 
BOWER 6531 Thomas Hardy. “ Number of members, 120. 
BOWER 6532 Mr. Bower, to Lynam.—Whether the person who made the report at that meeting, on the 29th of October, at the Unicorn, was the delegate 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6533 Surely so. 
BOWER 6534 Now go on from where you left off. 
BOWER 6535 Lynam
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6536 The next meeting was at the Crown, in Newgute-street, on the 14th of November. 
BOWER 6537 What passed at that meeting 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6538 Nothing materialtanev; I have no minute of any thing. 
BOWER 6539 Pass on to the next
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6540 I return back again here to a meeting at the Unicorn, November 12th. 
BOWER 6541 Of division, No. 2. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6542 Yes. 
BOWER 6543 What passed at that division
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6544 There was read a letter, written by Mr. Barlow—his address to the Convention, very inflammatory, and there were very loud plaudits at the reading. 
BOWER 6545 Who made the report that night
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6546 The delegate reports, the reportis always made by the delegate. 
EYRE 6547 Was thata letter addressed to the division, or communicated by the delegate as coming trom the committee of delegates 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6548 As coming from the committee of delegates, and it was Barlow’s Letter addressed to the Convention of France. The next is a report by somebody to the meeting, that the London Corresponding Society in London, in number, was six thousand; that the division, No. 14, meeting at Spitalfields, was increased, and would soon be equal in number to all the rest of the divisiuns of the society. The first mecting of the London Corresponding Society, I was informed, was at Mr. Robert Boyd’s, No. 11, Exeter-street, and that he had the first resolutions of the socicty ; I was shown one, dated the 2nd uf of EAinbureh he does not approve of the Address to the Convention, but was framing a paper to inform the public on politics, and would serid one svon to the society. 
EYRE 6549 How was that letter conveyed ; was that to the division, No. 2, at the Unicorn
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6550 Yes ; the London Corresponding Society’s address received by the National Convention, and ordered to be published and sent to the eighty-three departments. 
EYRE 6551 Is that a report of what had been done in France
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6552 Areport by the delegate, of their Address to the National Convention of France being received, and that by the Convention it was ordered to be published and sent to the eighty-three departments in France : The society at Sheffield sent up their Address to the Convention to the delegates, who had forwarded it; that is the whole at that meeting. 
EYRE 6553 Had sent up their Address to the committee of delegates
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6554 Yes, and they had forwarded it to the Convention. 
EYRE 6555 Is that the whole of the minutes you have of what passed at that time
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6556 It is. The next mecting was at the Crown, in Newgate‘street, No. 21, division No. 12: It was at this division mentioned, that there was a talk of a congress to be held in Scotland. The next thing that was done, was to read judge Asbhurst’s charge to the grand jury. Rerted, that a society at Norwich wanted to now, if we meant to come into the duke of Richmond’s plan, or to rip up monarchy ; they suspected that this was to draw them into some unguarded expressions, and declined answering. Reported, that the delegates had wrote to the society at Sheffield, and at Edinburgh. The next is, the branching off of the new division, from No. 12; the branching off was on the 21st of November, and this new division took No. 23, and met at the Ship in Moorfields, on the 27th of November. 
EYRE 6557 Were you a delegate of the new division, or did you continuc in the old one
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6558 I was chosen delegate of this first meeting on the 27th of November; it was recommended to inform the public that we were not levellers, and it was recommended to avoid riot or resistance to the laws. 
EYRE 6559 Were the reasons for that recommendation stated 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6560 There was, at ,the time, but I did not make any memorandum of it, but it was on account of the magistrates interfering with their meetings, some of the publicans had been threatened to have their licences taken away; in consequence of that, this was a recommendation of the division. 
EYRE 6561 Was this a recommendation to re from the ‘committee of delegates, reported by your delegate 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6562 It was a conversation—it was a recommendation of the division that it should be carried by me to the committee of delegates. Reported, that in Edinburgh, the first characters belonged to the cause, had formed themselves into a society, and called themselves a Convention of Delegates, and it was resolved to subscribe for the defence of any prosecuted member and his family. 
EYRE 6563 You do not mean a regular repdrt, but that this was conversation
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6564 It was conversation. The next remark that I have got, is—a meeting of delegates at the Sun, in Windmill-street, on the 29th of November; it was agreed to change the house weekly. 
EYRE 6565 Were yon present at a meeting of the delegees that day 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6566 Yes, there were twenty-two elegates met. 
EYRE 6567 Wus any paper, or any proposal brought forward there
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6568 The division, No. 11, had received twenty visitors rom Islington; a society was intended to be formed there— The sub-committee brought forward their answer to the Crown and Anchor, but it was referred back again to that sub-committee. 
EYRE 6569 What Crown and Anchor declaration was that referred to
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6570 The meeting of delegates must have had a letter from the Constitutional Society, which must have been read, and answered before I became a delegate ; so that what it wasI cannot tell. 
BOWER 6571 When you talk of the Crown and Anchor, do you mean the Society for Constitutional Information at the Crown and Anchor 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6572 Yes; there was one presented by counsellor Vaughan, a visitor from the Constitutional Socicty; he offering an answer, it was read and approved with some alterations; there were some parts of it that were objected to, and these words were. 
EYRE 6573 Was counsellor Vaughan present
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6574 Yes; he was a visitor from the Constitutional Society; the address that he brought forward was approved with some alterations, a part of the alteration was “ die in the cause. 
EYRE 6575 Putting in or taking out those words 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6576 Both. 
EYRE 6577 Did you mean that you struck out, or added those words 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6578 Struck them out; but, however, there was something there said in justification of those words, by something that passed in Cromwell’s time, about a brewer being made a colonel—It was agreed that this should be put in the Sunday’s paper if possible, and five undred large bills printed and stuck up about the town, that we are not levellers, and onc to be sent to each division, —Mr.Vaughan most strongly recommended good order andpeaceable conduct. 
BOWER 6579 You say you do not know what the paper was to which this was an answer, or where’ it came from 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6580  I did not see that; hut this answer, that was read that night and approved of, was brought forward by counsellor Vaughan, and these words were erased out, but were attempted to be justified. 
BOWER 6581 Do you know from what society at the Crown and Anchor that came 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6582 The Constitutional Society. 
BOWER 6583 It was an answer to something reccived before you were a member 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6584 Yes; if our funds were low the Constitutional Society would print for us. 
BOWER 6585 Who said that 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6586 Mr. Vaughan said that; 
BOWER 6587 1 it was then reported that many enemies to theIsociety had endeavoured to into the pent At this meeting it was reported that five divisions had been scouted, that is prevented meeting at the pent where they usually had met
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6588 Maurice Margarot made a motion to write to Mr. Pitt and the attorney general, that if our meetings were illegal he would surrender himself'; this was over-ruled, and it was agreed to support all prosecuted members, and recommended to all the divisions. — 
ERSKINE 6589 You wrote this down at the time 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6590 Yes. 
BOWER 6591 Did you receive that note from the prisoner Hardy ? [showing a paper to the witness j 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6592 Yes, I did. 
BOWER 6593 “ December 4, 1792. “Citizen Lynam, you are requested to meet the Special Committee this evening, at seven o'clock, at the Nag’s-head, OrangeStreet, Leicester-fields

BOWER 6597 Did you in consequence of this notice goto the place where that note required you to go
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6598 I did; but have no memorandum of any thing that passed. 
BOWER 6599 Have you apy recollection of what passed? I have not. 
BOWER 6600 Were you present at a meeting of any of the divisions, upon the 11th of December
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6601 Yes: Division No. 23, December the 11th. 
BOWER 6602 At what place 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6603 I fancy it was at the Brown- Bear, in Moortields, but I have not got it down. 
BOWER 6604 What passed at that meeting 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6605 It was reported at that meeting that the London Corresponding Society’s rules were introduced gmong the soldiers. 
BOWER 6606 Have you read as far as you have taken minutes of the 11th of December, at the Brown- Bear, in Moorfields 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6607 There were no new members admitted. Was any thing material done there?—It was reported that colonel Dalrymple, of Edinburgh, was determined to have a parliamentary reform; it was reported likewise, that the Irish were scouted, as we had heen; that they had applied to the council, who had decfared their meeting to be legal. 
BOWER 6608 To the council
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6609 Yes. 
BOWER 6610 Was it explained what council 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6611 The privy council in Dublin. A motion was then made that as the finances of the divisions are low, as they. Seuties pot the Address, the divisions are recomme: to subscribe. Three members of this division declared, at that time, that they would stick them up about the town. 
BOWER 6612 ‘W hat address was it that they were then talking about 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6613 I famcy that must have been the Address to the Constitutional Society, but I have not got the memorandum, whether it was that, or what it was. 
BOWER 6614 Was it the address that was produced by Mr. Vaughan 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6615 I rather think it was. There was a report here, that Baxter, who was a delegate of the division, No. 16, was at the meeting at Shoreditch Church, that he opposed the meeting, and that he was laid hold of; and that in consequence of that, seeing he could not resist, he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out many of the society’s addresses, and threw them with a good deal of exultation among the people assembled there, and he complained that he was very ill used, his coat torn, and he struck several times in the church- yard. i 
BOWER 6616 What meeting was that
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6617 That was at Shoreditch Church. 
BOWER 6618 What time are you got tonow 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6619 The 11th of December. , 
BOWER 6620 Do you know what that meeting was for
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6621 It was a meeting to support the constitution of the country. ‘ 
BOWER 6622 Now come to the 13th of December
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6623 Fhe next meeting was at Round-coyprt, in the Strand, on the 13th of December; that was a meeting ef the delegates. 
BOWER 6624 How many delegates were at that meeting
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6625 Eighteen. 
BOWER 6626 Was the prisoner there 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6627 He was there. 
BOWER 6628 What passed at that meeting
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6629 It was there reported that the magistrates were after Littlejohn, and that he is now going to Scotland. That has nothing at all to do with it, that is not of any consequence—a Mr. Field was chosen assistant secretary. A motion from the division, No. 4, that a letter should be wrote to the common council of London, to be wrote bythe secretary, to whom it was referred. Mr. Ridgeway was to publish Mr. Margarot’s letter to the secretary of state, and the receipt from the post-office ; that receipt from the post-office was to be taken in my name, and in Mr. Field, and Mr. Bell’s names. 
BOWER 6630 What letter are you now speaking of 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6631 Mr. Margarot’s letter to Mr. Secretary Dun das. 
EYRE 6632 What was that about the receipt from the Post-office
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6633 It was directed that the letter should be carried to the post-office by myself, Mr. Field, and Mr. Bell. oa , 
EYRE 6634 What letter was to be carried to the post-office 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6635 Mr. Marga rot's letter to Mr. Secretary Dundas. 
BOWER 6636 Were you to take a receipt there to show you had carried it there
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6637 Y es; if Mr. Bell had any objection to have his name in the receipt, the reccipt was ther to be inthe name of three of the delegates of the London Corresponding Society. 
BOWER 6638 Is that a copy of Mr. Margarot’s letter to Mr. Dundas 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6639  This is the letter. 
EYRE 6640 Where was Margarot at that time 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6641 He was at this meeting. 
BOWER 6642 It was put into the General Post-office, though the party was in London at the time? 
EYRE 6643 Is that a common thing 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6644 It was done at the request of Mr. Margarot, that the society might be sa‘tisfied that this letter was sent; and, therefore, instead of sending it down to Mr. Secretary Dundas’s office, it was determined to put it into the General Post-office, and then there was no doubt but that it would go safe. 
EYRE 6645 “ London, 4th December, 1792. “ No. 10, High-street, Marybone. 
EYRE 6646 “ Sir, Honoured with, and happy in the confidence of a number of my countrymen, I have their request to transmit officially to his majesty’s ministers, two addresses jomed in one, and containing together the reasons why we have associated for a parliamentary reform, and the legal and peaceable methods hy which we hope to maintain it. 
EYRE 6647 “So sanctioned, I must also inform you that this letter, and these addresses, equally speak the sentiments of some thousands of industrious citizens, in this capital; and of a far greater number dispersed throughout the island, there not being a single-corner of it (Rotten Boroughs excepted) but cries aloud for reform. Contig in the justice of our claim, in the merits of our peaceable demeanour, and our ready obedience to all the laws of our country, we imagine ourselves clear from all charge or imputation of sedition, rebellion, conspiracy or treason ;. and that in pursuing what no one can deny to be our right, we are entitled to every protection and support of vernament
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6648 I therefore, in behalf of my lellow citizens, this day call upon the king's ministers to protect and uphold us in the pursuit of our constitutional rights; and ire, that in future, our lawful and well re lated assemblies, may be no more disturbed or interrupted by the saucy interference of usurped authority, by men unnamed, working with threats upon the fears of uninformed publicans, and boasting of szcrer orders and warrants—as though Britain was fallen under a despotic government, and liable to be ruled, not by laws, but ions, and to be subservient to ministerial dictates, written on a drum head, and proclaimed by the mouth of the cation. 
EYRE 6649 “ Equally known by his activity as by his knowledge of the ned an honest i irate, whose spies had well informed him of the nature of our meetings, has acknowledged that they were peaceable, innocent, and consrituTionat, and further admits the necessity of a reform : at your hands, sir, I therefore, demand justice and protection for the society against all ruffians, who, let loose on the pate have dared, or shall henceforward dare, the satellites of ancient sanguinary tyrants, assume to themselves the double office of making laws and executingthem. Certain that such an iniquitous system cannot originate ina British cabinet, we exclaim, may perdition light equally upon such vile miscreants, and upon their employers ! 
EYRE 6650 “Were we, according to the hackneyed custom, to recur to precedents, we should say, that Mr. Pitt, and the duke of Richmond, have themselves traced out the path which we now yates that they themselves have asserted the rights of Britons, to a fair, equal, and adequate representation in parliament— that they, themselves, had invited us to associate and discuss our rights; and we might add, that in so doing, they spoke, they acted like honest men, they were not then in office.” 
EYRE 6651 “But the Rights of the People being ever the same, such precedents and such supporters are superfluous. However, as things seen through the medium of power, have a very different aspect from what they wore when those worthy gentlemen were on the other side of the question, it is not altogether improbable that severities may be bad recourse to, to quell that desire for reform which they themselves have raised. Should that be the case, I beg it as a favour, or rather, peng 5 the foremost rank, claim it as my right, the attack may commence upon me. Whenever extraordinary measures may be adopted, I earnestly wish to be the first of the society in feeling the effects of them, and shall deem it not a proud, but an honourable Gay, in which I shall be called upon to plead the cause of my fellow citizens against oppression. 
EYRE 6652 “ Claiming protection, I have a right to your answer, either to refuse or to it it—in either case it shall be made public, as shall also “ed silence, should you not attend to this letter, expressing the request of many thousand citizens. Our country shall then judge us both. I am, sir, your very humble serv:

JURYMEMBER 6707 ‘emple, her friend, sixteen delegates met, and col. lected in the whole 12s 6d. for her, and it was to be recommended to each division, but as a body they do not assist any body—There was a motion came forward then, for a declaration to the public, but objected to by two divisions, saying, power supersedes the laws, or, as it suits them, leaves those lawsdormant—sather have a constitution without a king than a king without a constitution. 
JURYMEMBER 6708 A declaration of what 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6709 I have not got it down here, and I do not recollect what it was: it was some declaration to the public—rather have a constitution without a king than s king without a constitution : This we say, if reduced to be republicans. 
EYRE 6710 Who proposed to publish that declaration? —This was a matter that was brought forward by some one of the delegates at the meeting, upon every thing of that sort that was proposed, the opinion was taken of every delegate, one after another, and in the course of taking that opinion, there were two of the divisions, or two of those delegates, that objected to it. 
EYRE 6711 Did that stop it 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6712 I do not think any thing was done in it. 
EYRE 6713 Was it according to the course of the business, that if two divisions objected, the measure was stopped for the time
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6714 No, only by the majority. Mr. Margarot then reported, that we had had no letters for two months, except one he had received that day, but the seal was opened and it was sealed again; it was then mentioned there were five delegates from the Roman Catholics, that they were of the same meaning with us, and it was agreed to try and see if we could not settle a correspondence with them. 
BOWER 6715 Five delegates present that day
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6716 No, it was reported that they were in London, Irish: Roman Catholics. 
BOWER 6717 Delegates from Ireland
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6718 Yes, then in Lom don—The next is the meeting of the division No. 28, January 8; I have it down here, that the declaration, which is, I suppose, the declaration mentioned before; that division met at No. 38, Crown-street, Moorfields. , 
BOWER 6719 Was the prisoner there 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6720 No; I have get down here, that the declaration ; it is opinion of this division that it should be rejected—it was agreed, likewise, not to address the king at all. 
BOWER 6721 ts that a declaration of the principles of the society
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6722 The declaration mentioned in the last meeting, I cannot tell what it was ; it was said thet Mr. Grey would not bring forward his motion for a retorm, unless petitions Lig sent to parliament ; ed to petition parliament by all means, af not to address them. 
ERSKINE 6723 Repeat that 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6724 Unless the several societies petitioned. 
EYRE 6725 And they agreed to petition by all means 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6726 Yes—The next is j} a meeting of the 10th uf January 1793, at No. 31, Old Compton-street, seventeen delegates attended; the declaration was ordered to lie upon the table; then it wasagreed upon that no written papers should come to a meeting of delegates but by a delegate, or through the treasurer or secretary ; carried unantmousy. 
BOWER 6727 Was Mr. ardy there 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6728 Yes ; Ido not remember Hardy being absent one night; Mr. Margarot then reported, that the country correspondence did not shine. 
BOWER 6729 What do you mean by shining 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6730 That there were but very few letters—He reported that he had sent a letter to the Friends of the People at Free-Masons’ tavern; the answer was read on the 15th of December, accepting our correspondence, that a reform by perseverance will be obtained 
BOWER 6731 That is the answer from Free-Masons’ 
BOWER 6732 tavern
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6733 Yes; and that they revered the constitution for protecting persons and property, and recommending us to be careful not to mix foreign politics with home politics, and to avoid foreign correspondence, by which means they would prevent the imputation of levellers, and would 1 prove that we are other. wise inclined ; signed, D. Stuart, secretary, No. 52, Queen-street, Dean-street: it was then remarked that this society never had brought forward their principles, and it-was determined not to correspond with them; Mr. Bell, one of the delegates, in consequence of the remarks that were made upon this letter, made this observation : Our addresses to the Convention of France, prove, that we mean their laws here. 
BOWER 6734 Was that assented to or dissented from, or what was the conduct of the committee upon it 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6735 It was not objected to; it was approved by all the meeting. 
BOWER 6736 Recollect whether any person present made any observation upon that
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6737 Mr. Margarot said, no doubt; but there was not any Body else that objected to it; it passed with the silent assent of the rest of the company. 
BOWER 6738 Did Mr. Margarot say any thing clse as to what should be the conduct of the society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6739 A t that time they were under a good deal of difficulty, being disturbed in their meetings, and avast deal of very strong language had been held both then and at former times, and atterwards too. 
BOWER 6740 You do not recollect whether he said any thing more than that
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6741 Not particularly; it was observed by some one of the delegates, that Mr. Pitt’s plan to add a hundred members to the House of Commons would not do, for wat alld al give them mes advan an us from: a proper reform; Mr. Gani tisen ast ‘he knew a person of the name of Dolon, who was secretary, and one of the Irish delegates too, and that he was ee off to Ireland ; that he knows his ad
BOWER 6742 8; he explained to him our endeavours, of which he approved, and he proposed to correspond with him; he said the Catholics had succeeded entirely; Bell had a friend that he knew, whose name was Devereux, one of the delegates, and he agreed to correspond by the post—however, that was said to be dangerous, as no letters go through the post-office—That is the whole of that meeting. The next is the 14th of January at Mr. Hardy’s. Mr. Hardy had sent fifty of our addresses, and twelve of Keirsant’s specches. 
BOWER 6743 Keirsant’s speech where
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6744 In the French Convention. 
BOWER 6745 Who told you Mr. Hardy had sent them 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6746 H e said himself that he had sent fifty of oor addresses, and twelve of Keirsant’s speech in the French Convention, to different correspondents in the country. 
BOWER 6747 When you speak of addresses, what do you mean 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6748 I mean of the original address of the society, 
EYRE 6749 This was a conversation at the prisoner’s
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6750 Yes,I called upon him; this I had from him at hisown house in conversation. The next is a meeting of delegates on the 17th of January. 
EYRE 6751 How many attended 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6752 I fancy I shall come to it afterwards. 
EYRE 6753 Where was that meeting
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6754 At No. 31, Compton-street ; it was then reported, that nineteen of the divisions were kept up at that time ; it was then agreed upon to debate, and to consider whether or no the age ot eighteen or twenty-one was the most proper age for allowing of voting for a member of parliament, and one reason given why eighteen was the proper time of life to have a vote, was, it was mentioned that they were liable at the age of eighteen to be militiamen—A motion was made by the delegate of division 18, to appoint a committee and report Carter’s case, and his family, and of the money necessary for their support: division No. 12 recom mended to consider of a public meeting to discuss a perliemearayy reform, but that was referred back again; the delegate of No. 15 recommended the society’s addresses to be iven, five to each member, forthe purpose of Seliverin them out to the public; the delegate of division No. 4, made a motion, that. the thanks of this society be conveyed to the mayor of Glasgow, a society at Durham, and a society at Dundee, for uniting with us in our intentions, and that it be recommended to correspond with them ; sixteen dclegates met; a petition from Carter presentcd, he is sentenced to six months imprisonment, to pay a fine, and find sureties; it was a remark of 
EYRE 6755 Mi t’s, that it was supposed it would be for life; a committee appointed to inquire into the opens of his defence, and the manner in which it had been conducted by Martin; a motion then was made, for all the delegates to meet every Saturday evening for public conversation, paying a-penny each for the room-:-agreed to, and to be when Carter’s business isdone; this public conversation was to discuss politics for the purpose of informing themselves of the situation of the then times, and what steps were pursuedain the House of Commons. The next is January the 17th
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6756 A letter from Norwich, that they admired our spirited conduct very much—that they wrote to Mr. Grey on the 11th instant, and to the Friends of the People, the Friends of the People propose a mild reformation--they want to know if they are friends that the societies are numerous, and in the count the magistrates prevent their increase ; signed, Blake.—that is, the letter received was signed Blake : Benjamin Hobhouse, esq. at Bath, had formed a society agreeable to ours; he advised us to point out a conveyance, and he would inform us how they went on, it was agreed to send a letter by the post, if it was not answered, then to send to a Mr. Richards, hookseller, at Bath ; then it was recommended to correspond with the Societies at Norwich, through the means of the Bell Society. 
EYRE 6757 What is the Bell Society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6758 Some society, I believe it was at Norwich : January ath, No. 31, Compton-street, there were two gentlemen came with a petition, which was drawn up, as it was supposed, by Mr. Harvey of the Temple—one of them was a delegate, who formerly had been delegate for No. 11, saying, Mr. Thompson's house had been searched m the dead of the night—Mrs. Thompson relies upon our sopra as promised—it was then determined that no such promise ever had been made to her—she wanted assistance to go to France—Hardy said, he had given her 2d. 15s. 6d. on the 5th instant, and then she thanked him—Martin thought it should be rejected, but it was agreed to—Martin then reported, that he had an er-officio from the atturney general, and he might be as much an object of the support of the delegates, and of the divisions, as she; upon Martin's exa‘mination, he drew up a long brief, and showed it to Mr. Vaughan, who had no objection to defend it—dfterwards he said it was indelicate to defend it, it being his own writing, and he wished it not to be known—it was recom“mended to apply to Mr. Erskine, but he declined it—then Mr. Garrow was applied to, he was found averse—then it was recormmended to Mr. Fielding, he declined it—then Mr. Warren undertook it—Martin said, that Grant was the sole cause of Carter's punishment, he had got the manuscript of the bill, and he declined looking for it—Martin wanted -to see it destroyed—it was then determined that Field, the sub-secretary, should apply to Grant, and if he did not give it up, thal be should be expelled the society, and then he would be expelled as our honorary visitor at the Crown and Anchor tavern. 
EYRE 6759 What manuscript is that
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6760 The manuscript of the bill, which was stuck up by this Carter, which he was imprisoned for: it was mentioned then that Littlejohn, likewise, was an honorary member, and that he would also be expelled; Martin then said, that he had seen Carter, who said that he had got in his pocket that which would do for the delegates—It was them determined that he should not receive his guinea a week after this, unless he asked pardon, and the manuscript was given up by Grant. 
BOWER 6761 Who should not receive a guinea a week 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6762 Carter should not receive 3 guinea a week which he was allowed by the society. Motion from division 16, to address a letter to the Friends of the Liberty of the Press, for their exertion at the Crown and Anchor, the same people as met there under Constitutional Information. A letter from Norwich to be answered, but it was not A letter from Richter, saying he dare not attend us, but that we may depend upon his being a friend: he carried the to Grant. The delegates are to meet next Thursday, No. 8, Queen street, Seven-dials. The delegate of the division (I think No. 5) is going to France, and he has got some copies of T. Paine’s works; he received a letter on Tuesday night from a friend at twelve o’clock, saying, “a hint to the wise, you will all be taken up. 
BOWER 6763 Was Hardy present
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6764 Yes. The next is a meeting of selegeiea on the Sist of January. A motion brought forward by the delegate of division No. 16, which was Baxter, wishing that six-pence may be paid only to the society, and the other seven-pence to go towards the expense of their room, it was agreed that this might be a very proper measure to be adopted for pos divisions ; it was particularly remarked that at that time the people round Spitaltields were exceedingly numerous, and supposing that they should come to any open resistance these were divisions that ought particularly to be encouraged. 
BOWER 6765 Repeat that slow 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6766 A motion was brought forward by the delegate for No. 16, Baxter, wishing that six-pence (a quarter, it should be) may be paid only to the society, 
BOWER 6767 -and tbe other seven-pence that was paid, to go towaris the expense of their room ; it was agreed that though this might be very proper in all poor divisions, it was remarked at that time, and it was assented to by the whale Meeting of delegates, that supposing there should be an opposition, or that the two parties in fact stooald come to an open declaration, an open rupture, that it was absolutely necessary to give encouragement to the divisions meeting in Spitalfields, for that they OO 
BOWER 6768 in youl were very poor, and very numerous, and it was very necessary to keep them together. There was a good deal of conversation upon the necessity, and the propriety of it. 
BOWER 6769 Have you all that in your minutes 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6770 It is from recollection that I speak this, but this is the meaning of what was agreed upon b: all the delegates that met at that time, but it was particularly first of all mentioned by Baxt er. 
EYRE 6771 How much of it have you a minute of 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6772 I have got no further than that it was agreed by the delegates that this might be very well in poor divisions, the other is recollection which I remember perfectly well; I have made a remark before of these divisions, that they increase so fast, that they were well satisfied that, in these divisions alone, very shortly they would have as many in number as there were in number in all the other divisions besides, A motion was made by the delegate of division No. 7, that Mr. Law's letter to Mr. Reeves, giving his reason for withdrawing himself from them, be published, to show the infamy of their proceedings, that the society was falling away very fast; but this motion was rejected, and instead of that, to publish extracts from “ The War, or who pays the Reckoning? deferred the selection for one week. Our letters to the Friends of the People, are directed to Mr. Byng, chairman of the committee, they have directed their secretary to answer it—their answer is to keep from foreign politics, to Keep good order, and by petition we may suc

UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6774 I his is only giving an account to whom our letters were directed when they corresponded with the Friends of the People, there is an sumer at oe ame wherein it advises us to eep from foreign politics, to kee order, and by petition we may socket in was answered by Maurice Margarot, saying we mean to proceed orderly, but you are not explicit. 
JURYMEMBER 6775 id Margarot say any thing, make any obsecralion as to the committee of delegates 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6776 Yes. 
EYRE 6777 Does your minute purport that that reply was produced at this meeting of delegates, that it was produced upon that day 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6778 I will not be confident of that. 
EYRE 6779 Go through your minute and see what it is
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6780 It was answered by Maurice Margarot, saying, we mean to proceed orderly, but you are not explicit. 
ERSKINE 6781 Do you mean answered in writing 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6782 In writing; there were several letters that were wrote by Margarot himself 
ERSKINE 6783 -without being shown to the delegates, and after he had wrote them, when lic came to the meeting of delegates he reported that he hhad wrote such a letter, and he gave the heads of such letter. He said to that society, but you are not explicit, and he requested that ee 
ERSKINE 6784 they would be more particular; your concurrence will assist us, but we want to know how far you mean to po in the design ; then a remark was made that we are very apprehensive of creating a breach between them, as is the case between them and the Constitutional Society; there was a good deal of conversation in consequence of that letter, that the Society of the Friends of the People did not go so far in their idea as the London Corresponding Speiety and the Constitutional Society did, for-all along it was held as an invariable idea that eventually it must come to a struggle. 
EYRE 6785  You are not speaking now from a minule
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6786 From my recollection of what was often repeated. 
BOWER 6787 Do you recollect Margarot saying any thing after this reply that he had sent to the Friends of the People 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6788 Margarot stated that there was a disunion between the Constitutional Society and the Society of the Friends of the People; but I cannot say I recollect exactly what was the reason of it.— There were thirteen delegates met that night. —A letter from Sheffield of the 1G6th’.of January, 1793, signed, David Martin president, Horsefall secretary, recommending a communication with all the societies in the kingdom, to form a constitutional meeting, and all to agree upon the same thing—asked how far we mean to proceed at this time—A reform nugatory, unless universal right is established, and they advise a general petition to the House of Commons, on the present inadequate representation—they want to know if the Friends of the People are true friends—Margarot says we are getting on too fast again, and that petition was not the mode. 
BOWER 6789 Was that an observation he then made, or your own observation to the delegates 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6790 His observation to the delegates.—Margarot said, petition was not the mode; but at the same time it was agreed upon by him and the rest of the delegates, that petitions should be presented for the sake of Reaping. the public mind agitated with a reform. It was then recommended that all the divisions should go to No. 52, in Frith-street, and sign the address of the Friends of the Liberty of the Press; that is, every delegate wus to recommend it to his division, at the next meeting. —In the course of the mecting, Margarot made a remark, that our address to Mr. Reeves was not liable to any punishment, or he and Mr. Hardy would have been taken up, Margarot said, he meant to invite sir Sampson Wright to his division, or any one that he might send to the divisions, to show the legality of them; thatis, the whole of that meeting of delegates. The next that I have is only reports at the divisions made by members at different times.—On the 5th of February, in Crown-street ; this is. 
EYRE 6791 Did you attend no longer as a delezate
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6792 Yes; this is a meeting of the Division No. 23,—Bambridge read a minute that there are sixty friends to the cause, who decline at present meeting the society; but they are good friends, and sincerely wish them success; and some of them say, if they want money, they are ready to contribute.—He says, there are certain religious societies in the kingdom, almost in every town, whose sentiments lead them strictly to republicanism ; they are numerous in Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester, Hull, Derbyshire, and particularly in London. The society in London are just now beginning to organize themselves agreeable to the principles of France—their meetings are Mondays and Thursdays.—It was then suid that Tom Paine’s Works had been published in Sweden.—The next meeting was on the 7th of February, of Delegates, No. 8, in Queen-street, Seven Dials. 
EYRE 6793 Was the prisoner there
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6794 He was. At this meeting it was proposed that the surplus of the quarterage of the different divisions, if there should be any, should go towards paying the deficiency of Baxter’s division, No. 16, for their room. We must preserve the divisions No, 25 and 16, being poor, they will be of great service if we go to war.—This was an observation from Margarot at that time. 
EYRE 6795 No. 25, and No. 16, were, I understand, the Spital-fields divisions? — They are the two Spital-fields divisions. 
EYRE 6796 Was the expression, war 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6797 Yes. 
EYRE 6798 Was there any explanation given of that expression 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6799 The explanation that was given was this—It was understood: 
EYRE 6800 I did not ask how you understood it, but whether there was any explanation actually given in words, at that time, by any body, of what was meant by war f—That the country would rise against the present government. 
BOWER 6801 Who said that
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6802 Margarot. 
BOWER 6803 Did Margarot say that the country would rise against the present government, or did he use the word war, and you understood that he meant by that, rising against the government of the country 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6804 He made use of the term war. 
BOWER 6805 And you understood he meant that 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6806 Yes; and it was mentioned by several of the delegates, that it was eventually expected that there would certainly be a rising in the country. 
BOWER 6807 Was there any conversation of that kind at the time when Margarot made use of that expression 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6808 Yes ; it was taken up and spoke to by several of the delegates that night. 
ERSKINE 6809 Have you any note of this
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6810 I have not; but I remember it perfectly —A letter sent to Bath has been gone fourteen days, and no answer.—No letters received this week.—A Sheffield letter of the 16th of January, 1798, by order of the Society for Constitutional Information, conveyed to all societies, they request to know how far they mean to go—it is their opinion that we should be of one opinion to petition parliament this season—it will give strength to the cause.— The restoration of the right of election not to be under twenty-one—by doing this we shall know how far we can support Mr. Grey’s motion this season—no time to be lost—Hardy proposes a delegate from each division of the society, tu agree how to proceed—Mr. Fox has said in the House, the people have aright to alter the government when they please, the Scotch have done it, and the Irish.—The London Corresponding Society was first formed to send a delegate to all the other societies, to determine the best way of reform. 
EYRE 6811 You said that Hardy proposed a delegate from each division 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6812 That is, to agree how to proceed ; thal is another thing—next follows Mr. Fox’s observation in the House of Commons. 
BOWER 6813 Who states that observation of Mr. Fox’s—I do not know; it was cbserved; and the same with regard to this, I do not take upon me to say who particularly said this. 
BOWER 6814 What is meant by first formed 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6815 is it descriptive of what was the intention of the society when first formed? or what is the meaning of it?—It is simply an observation that was made from one of the delegates, saying, that the principles of the society first of all, the intention—was, for arefurm in parliament. The Friends of the People in the Borough yet exist; and it was determined to communicate our letters to them and all other societies, and inquire their intentions.—It was then agreed that a circular letter should be sent to all the socictics in London, to meet two or three from each, and come to some determination. The question to be debated at each division, was, what is the best way of proceeding ?—This is to be done by advertisement in Saturday, Sunday, and Monday's papers, that it will be discussed the next night at each division, and that there are to be six advertisements—fifteen delegates met. It was then determined to write to Sheffield, and to inform them that we will answer them very shortly, how we mean to proceed.—The next is the 14th of February, 1793, division No. 19, met at Mr. Godfrey's, an attorney, in Fore-street, and chose him for delegate ; but we rejected him, being lord George Gordon's attorney, and agreed to reject connected with him. 
BOWER 6816 Why did they reject him on that account
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6817 They were determined to have nothing at all to do with any person that had any connexion with lord George Gordon; and the division No. 12, had a n of the name of Watson, supposed to be secretary to lord George Gordon, that attended them; and it was intimated that lord George Gordon was by some means acyuainted with what was going on; that he made use of this Watson f; way of bringing forward different things;they conceived he would be very troublesome, j an that if his name was connected with theCorresponding Society, it would make them disrespectful in the eyes of the public; they then rejected him.—Division No. 12 to meet next Wednesday evening, at the Crown inNewgate-street ; but if refused at the Crown, to go to Robins’s coffee-house in Shire-lane, who would take in any of the divisions.—To be considered next meeting, whether you petition parliament—that will engage the public attention for the present. 
EYRE 6818 Does it appear whether there was any delegate chosen, or not
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6819 There was no farther proceeding upon this, than just remarking, that it would be necessary to come to a determination at the next meeting of delegates, whether it was agreeable to the differcnt divisions to petition parliament.—This was a meeting of the deJegates. 
EYRE 6820 Lord Chief Justice Eyre. Whom was 
EYRE 6821 Godfrey rejected by 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6822 by the delegates, or by his own division ?— By the delegates.— Agreed to demand a conference with the Constitutional Society—they are drawing up the state of the representation, and are going as far as us.—The Friends of the People do not go so far.—The Borough Society do not go so far. —The Holborn Society say they are for republicanism. 
EYRE 6823 Mr. Bower. What is become of the Iolborn Society
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6824 It is broke up; and the greatest part of the members have joined the Corresponding Society since—The Aldgate Society is now called the Bother’em society —that society is since broke up.—There are about six societies in London to confer with.—tThe Friends of the People have not yet answered our lJetter.—A letter sent to the Constitutional Whigs at Sheffield, saying, we are about a general conference, and shall write to them.—There are two societies at Norwich united — the Constitutional Society wrote them to continue, and assured them we are firm, and mean to collect the general opinion. —Three questions for consideration in the divisions, whether they shall petition the king, or the purliament, or call a convention. 
EYRE 6825 Was that contained in your letter to the society at Norwich? —This is what was agreed by the meeting of the delegates, to be sent by each delegate to each division, to consider what they should do at that time; and it is statedas three questions—frrst of all whether you will petition the king, or whether you will petition the parliament, or whether you will call a convention, to be submitted to the delegates. It was remarked that it might be as well to decline coming to any resolution till the whole nation are agreed
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6826 Then Margarot says, neither peLition nor remonstrete, it would be unconstitutional, that finishes his observation. Then 
EYRE 6827 1 is reported that the Aldgate society hadthanked Mr. Fox for his speech, saying that the people may alter the constitution without giving their reasons for it—that is the society that were got together, and called the Bother’em society
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6828 The next is a meeting of division No. 23, on the 19th of February, ia 
EYRE 6829 Crown-street — t was agitated there, upom the question, which was the right age for election, eighteen or twenty-one—there wasa great difference of opinion in the meetiag— 
EYRE 6830 one was for eighteen years, ten for twenty-one, and one for neither, unless householders
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6831  Printed copies of the petition to parliament to be distributed amongst the public—that means that they had come toa determination to petition parliament, not to petition the king, nor to call a convention.—Field met the division No. 12, at the Crown in Newgate-street—they were refused meeting, they then went to Godtrey’s, and re-chose himadelegate.—I do not know whether I have mentioned that this was a delegate meeting, on the 21st of February, at‘No. 31, Comptonstreet, this last matter Godfrey rejected —bee ing re-chose, he insisting on his rightof being deleguie and insisting upon staying in the room, there was no other way of getting rid of him but by adjourning to No. 57, CharlesStreet, to meet on the Saturday evening.—It was reported that a great number of delogates were in town from Scotland, upon a reform. —A letter from Southampton, approving of the plan, and want our addresses to forms society, and wanted us to correspond witbr them.—A letter to be sent to them by divisin No. 28.—The Constitutional Society have adjourned till the 15th of March, supposed to see what Mr. Grey does in parlias ment.—Agreed to write to all the societies, both in town and country, to send a petition to parliament—no time to be lost—ours to be drawn up immediately; and we are certaim that twenty thousand will sign it, if they are all rejected, write to them to continue; and then will be the time for all to unite, and to petition the king.—This is a report likewise —that the Friends of the People approve of Mr. Grey’s remonstrance—it is a leading feature. Reported that the serious stoppages from the bank’s refusing to discount, will assist the cause, from the failures which must follow. 
EYRE 6832 Mr. Erskine. Is that a report, or what somebody eaid 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6833 I mentioned it as a report —it was reported by one of the delegates, at the meeting of delegates—net that it came from any of the divisions.—A letter was read from T. Farley, esq. upon the illegality of imprisonment for debt, saying, he had been five years writing a treatise on it; and he wants us to subscribe to it—it was agreed that we could not give him that support'that we supposed that he wanted ; but, however extracts might be made from that book, so as to be serviceable.—A letter from the Friends of the People, dated 15th of February, in answer to ours of the 1st of February, signed by 3sE

BOWER 6864 Lord Chief Justice Eyre..—Was it said where these two letters came from to the Friends of the People
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6865 I take it for granted from Sheffield; but I have not put it down. Litdejohn was discharged for the neglect, I believe, of his division; he was gone down into Scotland. 
BOWER 6866 Did you minute what Grant was discharged for
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6867 In consequence of a former resolution, that if he did not deliver up the mapuscript he should be discharged ; and now they were discharged. A motion was made by Margarot to print a thousand of Trend's Address to Republicans and AntiRepublicans, to make extracts frum it by a select committee, with some strong remarks thereon by them.

The next meeiing was the 28th of March, at No. 31, Compton-street, a meeting of delegates. It was agreed to bring all the quarterage next Thursday, the Patriotic Society, in Holborn, joining the division No. 29, 
EYRE 6870 Was this Patriotic Society the same you mentioned before, that broke up, and the greatest part joined the Corresponding Society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6871 The same. The report was of the number of signatures to the petition; the whole was seven hundred eighteen on the five skins. A select committee chose to make laws for the society, and to submit thein to each division, to meet every Thursday afternoon at five o'clock; any three to proceed to business; other delegates allowed to visit. 
EYRE 6872 Have you any minute of any debates upon the subject of the necessity or the occasiun of proposing this committee 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6873 I have no minute of any debate. I see here is a mark made here—the committee to make extracts from Mr. Frend’s Address to Republicans and Anti-Republicans, they are to meet on Sunday evening—fourteen delegates met on the 4th of April, in Compton-street—the select committee to consider of their future regulations, first of all for the society at large—the general rules and vate regulations for the admission of mem

UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6876 The next is the 11th of April, at No. 31, Compton-street. The report was that two thousand had signed the petition: resolved to thank the Friends, of the People for their impartial state of the Tepresentation. It was then said that the. Constitutional Society at Shefheld had done it, and had requested them to publish it ina cheaper manner. In their lelter they say the pape are sleeping too long; the ignorance, of the people is the cause of the continuation of the corruption of the senate—resolved to write immediately to every society again, and request them to petition directly ; small bills to be stuck up in the night, informing the public where the petition lies for signatures— fourteen delegates met—Mr. Francis to be requested to present the petition—recommended by division No. 2, to advertise a general meeting at some tavern, and we may get a good many signatures there, already signed, 2,519. 
BOWER 6877 You may go now to the 29th of April; T do not see any thing material till the, he anniversary dinner of the Constitutional Society at the Crown and Anchor,—were you present at that dinner

BOWER 6879 Did you make a minute of what passed there
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6880 I made this minute, that many of them talked very boldly, and laughed at the fears of the public, they are sure that a revolution will take place in this country. 
BOWER 6881 Who was in the chair 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6882 Lord Sempill was chairman--.the next that I have got is the sentiments that were drank, The rights of man, May we never be ashamed to assert those principles we wish to enjoy—May despotism be trampled under the hoofs of the swinish multitude, May the world be our country, and doing good our religion--- Freee dom to France, and peace to all Europe--Thomas Paine. 
BOWER 6883 Have you any remark upon that 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6884 TI have senesced here that Horne Tooke requested him to be given a second time, may the temple of freedom have the earth for its basis, and heaven for its dome—may governments soon cease to be a conspiracy against the few, for the rights of the many.

UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6886 No; I have it so, by lord Daer, John Horne Tooke for his vigilant opposition to despotism—The victims of despotism, and may the people of Great Britain have courage to redress them, lord Sempill, Mr. Fitzgerald, &c. Those are the toasts that were drank. The next is the second of May, 1793, a delegates’ mecting, at No. 31, Campton- street. r, Fox wrote to Mr. Hardy, at nine o'clock at night, that our saying a radical reform would be understood uni

EYRE 6888 Did not you say that there was a resolution that there should be a new clection of delegates on the 28th of March 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6889 Yes. 
EYRE 6890 Was there a new election of delegates 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6891 Yes. 
EYRE 6892 Were you reelected 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6893 Yes ; on the 25th of September. 
BOWER 6894 You have got a minute the 16th of May, have not you
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6895 I have mislaid that by some means or other. 
BOWER 6896 Do you remember any thing passing upon the 16th of May respecting the war and the addressers
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6897 No. 
BOWER 6898 Look at that paper. Did you find that among Mr. Hardy's papers 
LAUZUN 6899 Yes. 
BOWER 6900 South-street, Ind of May, 1793. " Sir; I am to apologize to you for not having sooner answered your letter, but I have been very much engaged in business for some days past. I will certainly present the petition if it is desired, because I would not decline presenting a petition for any of my constituents; but I confess I think it might with more propriety be presented by some other member, because it is generall understood that the radical reform, which it recommends, is universal representation, to which I have always been an avowed enemy. 
BOWER 6901 “ I am, Sir, your most obedient and most bumble servant, C. J. Fox. [No aeidreas Indorsed, Charles James Fox, M. P.

BOWER 6903 Mr. Bower to Lynam
LAUZUN 6904 As you have mislaid your minutes of the 16th of May, I will not press you upon it.—I have the minutes of May the 16th here, No. 31, ComptonStreet. 
BOWER 6905 Was the prisoner at that meeting 
LAUZUN 6906 Yes ; 
BOWER 6907 e was, 
BOWER 6908 What passed there
LAUZUN 6909 A motion from the division No. 7, to draw up a remonstrance against the war; it was then said that Mr. 
BOWER 6910 Hardy had received an anonymous letter, saying that, as the late petition lay at your house, I look upon it you are secretary; and he says, being a friend to man, something--and the salutary rights; he very much approves of the petition and the thanks to the minority; he submits it in his letter, that if & petition against the present war is brought forward, it will refute its being a lar one; then he goes with regard to the subscriptions and the expenses of the society. 
BOWER 6911 You had better pass it over if you cannot make it out well. 
EYRE 6912 Was any thing done upon that anonymous letter 
LAUZUN 6913 it does not appear that any thing was. The next was a meeting of the delegates on the 23rd, at No. 31, Compton-street ; it was then proposed to calla peneral meeting, which would be an irrefragable proof of our being legally assembled, and would take away those reflections upon us, and dissipate the fears of the public: this was to be agitated at each division. 
EYRE 6914 Who made that proposition to call a general meeting 
LAUZUN 6915 I cannot tell. There were twelve delegates met; a letter from R. Littlejohn, dated 18th of May, in which he says, he was surprised that he was excluded the society ; his attachment is not to be bought or sold, and he would not give up the cause but with death ; this is what collected from that letter. Committee for drawing up an address to the public, &c.; then it was observed, that Le Brun’ letter to lord Grenville has altered the step; on that account it would appear as though we had some communication with France, therefore we ought to wait to see if any notice is taken of it. It was thought proper to refer the addresses to the public at that time, and it was referred for a week. 
EYRE 6916 What did you say it might be thalety to do 
LAUZUN 6917 It would appear as though we had some communication with France. The next meeting was on the 30th of May. I do not find any thing more than Mr. Hardy’s intending to make a motion that we should b: up for three months. 
EYRE 6918 What was done upon that
LAUZUN 6919 It was not carried, but the society continued ; for I have areport on the 6th of June, in consequence of it. The next was a meeting of delegates of the 6th of Jume, 17938, at No. 31, Compton-street, there were three divisions that wished for Mr. Wharton’s motion in the House of Commons to be printed. 
EYRE 6920 Was any thing done with respect to Mr. Wharton's motion 
LAUZUN 6921 I have no remark that any thing at all was done, notwithstanding it was so recommended. A public meeting was then talked of; to advertise five for six o’clock, 
EYRE 6922  Advised ot agreed upon 
LAUZUN 6923 I shall come to that presently. I forget whether it was determined upon at that time, but there was a meeting which followed afterwards; this is the beginning of it; it was agreed to admit every division. 
BOWER 6924 What was the proposition? To advertise a public meeting; and that it should be advertised to meet at five o'clock, but the intention was to meet and begin upon business at six; a motion from division No. 8, — 
BOWER 6925 of Mr. Wharton’s speech correct—Mr. Margarot will get one thousand for us. 
BOWER 6926 Have you any thing farther of that meeting 
LAUZUN 6927 Nothing more. 
BOWER 6928 "about this time did you for any period cease to be a delegate? Was there any division upon what you have been last reading
LAUZUN 6929 I do not recollect that there was. 
ERSKINE 6930 Do you mean to say that uu recollect there was not
LAUZUN 6931 My answer is, if there had been any thing of the sort, I should have made a memorandum if any thing particular; I do not recollect that there was any thing of a division, but I remember it was said by Margarot. 
ERSKINE 6932 Is that in your note No; Iam going to tell you my recollection. He said he would get a thousand for the London Corresponding Society ; but I have no minute of that; if you mean to put that down as that the thanks of the committee be given to Mr. Wharton for his motion and speech. 
ERSKINE 6933 Mr. Wharton the member of parliament
LAUZUN 6934 Yes 5 and it was agreed to be inted, and the thanks to be published in Fret papers, the Courier, Chronicle, Gazetteer, and Ledger. 
BOWER 6935 Does it appear by your minutes whether it was only to be published, or have youany farther entry respecting what was to be done besides publishing
LAUZUN 6936 I have this memorandum, that it was to be put once in each paper; that is to say, that it was to be advertised four times; it was likewise agreed that there should be some comments made upon it, and a special committee, to draw it up, of five of the delegates; it was to be an open committee, and to meet at six o’clock on Monday—A letter from Leeds, a delegate meeting, May the 30th, 1793, a societ lately sprung up, sent by the request of the Sheffield society, to correspond with all societies, and begged ours, although ony 200, yet are determined to instruct all their neighbours, Thomas Hardy, secretary, it was instituted the z7th of November, 1792,

LAUZUN 6952 Yes. 
BOWER 6953 it is all at meetings of delegates, unless I shall mark it as some other meeting. 
LYNAM 6954 Resolved that thanks be given to the twelve men that voted with Mr. Whatton the 6th of June—The Constitutional Society for information have published ten thousand from one of the division of a gentleman that lives at Walworth, who is going to join the Jondon Corresponding Sociely : and it is at the same time observed, that he wrote the offensive play-bill, the guillotine, his name is evening, in the information that they endeavoured to bring forward of different circumstances, it was stated in that way, and it was followed up by a remark from the same:person, that many people supposed that he was employed by the Convention in France. 
LYNAM 6955 Were any other papers brought forward 
LAUZUN 6956 It was reported that there was a petitian to the king brought forward at the last meeting of delegates; but that itwas declared treasonable by Mr. Vaughan, in consequence of which auother was to be drawn up. 
LYNAM 6957 When you say it was treasouable, do you mean to say that that was Mr. Vaughan’s opinion 
LAUZUN 6958 It was reported by several that Mr. Vaughan had given that as his opinion. 
LYNAM 6959 Was any thing done upon that 
LAUZUN 6960 That is all. 
LYNAM 6961 Did the delegate report any thing farther, after it was found that that petition was supposed to be treasonable 
LAUZUN 6962 Only that another was to be drawn up. 
LYNAM 6963 Was there any thing farther done at that meeting 
LAUZUN 6964 I have no memorandum of any thing else. 
LYNAM 6965 Or have you any recollection? if not, go on to the next meeting, which was on the 7th of October
LAUZUN 6966 The report of the delegate was, that there were eighteen new members made that week.

LAUZUN 6968 Yes, the same division meeting, Oct. 7th, that a! 
LYNAM 6969 Mr. Bell, who was at Brighton, was going to Ireland, and would introduce a correspondence with the societies there, from the London Corresponding Society. At the last meeting of delegates a petition was brought forward, or agitated, was brought forward, discussed, I suppose, against the war, nothing more is said of that. Hvdgson was chose president, and Hardy was continued secretary; the next is November the 5th. 
LYNAM 6970 Before you go to November the 5th, were you present at any other meeting, at Hackney, or any other place 
LAUZUN 6971 Yes. 
LYNAM 6972 At what time was that—it has indeed been proved to be the 24th of October 
LAUZUN 6973 I do not recollect the day of the month that that meeting was, but it was to elect two delegates to send down to the Convention at Scotland.

LAUZUN 6975 Margarot and Gerrald, I think. 
LYNAM 6976 Who appeared as president of the society at that time
LAUZUN 6977 Llodgson. 
LYNAM 6978 Where was this meeting
LAUZUN 6979 At a house in Hackney-road, the election was ina garden behind the house. 
LYNAM 6980 Was Mr. Hardy at that meeting in Ilackneyroad
LAUZUN 6981 I think he was, but 1 will not be positive. 
LYNAM 6982 What meeting were you aton the 5th of November 
LAUZUN 6983 Division, No. 3, the delegate reported, that Hodgson had resigned, and 
LYNAM 6984 ‘that Baxter was chosen chairman; he then reported that Margarot and Gerrald went to 
LYNAM 6985 Scotland, the 80th of October, and that the fund was very low, the subscription not equal to the expenses. 
LYNAM 6986 Where was this
LAUZUN 6987 At the same place ncar Bunhill-row; the next report was that a second delegate should be chose from each division, to furm a sub-committee, to revise the constitution, and to meet every Friday, at No. 31, Compton-street; the next. report was of a new society formed at Bristol; the next that colonel Macleod, and Mr. Sinclair, were one as delegates to Edinburgh, from the 
LYNAM 6988 Constitutional Society; the next meeting was November the 12th. 
LYNAM 6989 Before you get to November the 12th, were there any reports made upon the 5th of November, respecting F, low 
LAUZUN 6990 I have no memorandum of that. 
LYNAM 6991 Do you recollect any thing stated about Franklow, upon the 5th of November 
LAUZUN 6992 I recollect it being said, that there was going to be an association formed at Lambeth, for the. purpose of learving their exercise. 
LYNAM 6993 Recollect all the circumstances that youcan, respecting that. 
GIBBS 6994 Let us understand that you have no memorandum of this 
LAUZUN 6995 No. 
BOWER 6996 Do you recollect any other circumstance that was to attend that meeting
LAUZUN 6997 I understovd that they were going to form themselves into different societies. 
BOWER 6998 Of whom were those societies to be composed 
LAUZUN 6999 I was going to say a plan was forming for those societies to learn their exercise at different places all over London, and that it was to be confined to the LandonCorresponding Society. Do you recollect any thing farther being ; said about the plan?—Not partheaarly. 
BOWER 7000 Afterwards itwas more particularly broug forward; but I have not, to the best of my recollection, any thiug more. 
BOWER 7001 The plan was not at that time completed
LAUZUN 7002 No, the forming of the society, and how they were to meet, to carry it on, was not at that time mature to the best of my recollection, but this was said, that there was a variety of people that did intend to learn their exescise, but this at Lambeth was the only one that was mentioned. 
BOWER 7003 There was no association formed Lut the Lambeth
LAUZUN 7004 No, but it came out afterwards, and probably, it will not be improper to mention it here, that there were members of the London Corresponding Society, that had a desire of introducing the exercise among the London Corresponding Societies divisions oa different nights, from the night that the divisions met on different evenings. 
BOWER 7005 Was that agreed to or otherwise 
LAUZUN 7006 It was rejected at No. 23, but this is only antieipating it. 
BOWER 7007 It will come better in its order by-and-by; who was president of this society, on the 5th of November, chairman of the delegates, and so on

BOWER 7014 What was done at that meeting
LAUZUN 7015 Read a letter from Norwich, signed W. Cole, from all the societies there, approving of the Convention at Edinburgh, and requesting a constant correspondence; finances are very low, they want to get a second subscription in order to support the delegates in Scotland. 
EYRE 7016 Do you mean the finances at Norwich or of your society 
LAUZUN 7017 From Norwich, and then here seems a kind of instruction to the delegates, requesting them tovisit all the societies in Scotland. 
ERSKINE 7018 Let me take that down in your own words; there seems a sort of instruction from the delegates requesting them to visit all the societies in Scotland ? 
EYRE 7019 How do you state that
LAUZUN 7020 The finances are very low, in order to get a second subscription, in order to support the delegates in Scotland, the instruction is with regard to a letter that has been sent to the delegates requesting them to visit ail the societies in Scotland, there is something that I gathered from the delegate, reporting it the committee of: delegates.

LAUZUN 7025 It was reported that the finances were very low, and they want to get a second subscription to support the delegates in Scotland, 
EYRE 7026 That was part of the Norwich letter
LAUZUN 7027 I thought so at first, but Jooking at it again I rather conceive that this is the report of a delegate from the committee of delegates. 
ERSKINE 7028 There seemed to be a sort of instruction, gunered from a delegate, who collected it from the committee of delegates, I thought it was the Norwich letter first, but looking at At again, I rather conceive—what do you conceive ? 
ERSKINE 7029 Lynam
LAUZUN 7030 That the finances of the Corresponding Society were low, and that they wanted a second subscription to support the delegates in Scotland. 
EYRE 7031 Then what was Meant about instructions
LAUZUN 7032 The instructions were in a letter that had been sent, but by whom I have no memorandum here, to the delegates to visit all the societies in Scotland. 
EYRE 7033 td Chief Justice Eyre
LAUZUN 7034 Do you mean concerning something that I 
EYRE 7035 that there was an instruction sent to them in a letter 
LAUZUN 7036 I do; it was reported by the delegates, that there was goihg te be a second general meeting to be held at Edinburgh, but afterwards it was altered and intended to be held atGlasgow instead of Edinburgh. 
BOWER 7037 This is the 12th of November
LAUZUN 7038 Yes. 
BOWER 7039 When were you re-elected, if ever you were re-elected, a delegate from any of those divisions ? 
BOWER 7040 We have the letter which has been read of the 8th of November, from the prisoner, to the delegates in Scotland. 
GIBBS 7041 Have not you some notes you have gone through 
LAUZUN 7042 Yees, I have put them in my pocket. 
GIBBS 7043 I desire to look at them? 
GIBBS 7044 The Witness delivers them to Mr. Gibbs, saying,—I presume you will give them me again. 
GIBBS 7045 What reason have you, sir, to suppose that I will not give them to you apes Te you mix them, it may be impossible for me to arrange them again. 
GIBBS 7046 You have given me these papers, mark them 1, 2, 3, 4. 
BOWER 7047 I bey to go through my examination; do not be marking apers while I am examining you; put them in your pocket till we have done. You were elected a delegate again at what time
LAUZUN 7048 The first meeting I attended of the delegates, being re-elected, was on the 2d of January, 1794. 
BOWER 7049 Was Mr. Hardy a new member, when you attended as a new member
LAUZUN 7050 He was secretary. 
BOWER 7051 After you re-commenced a delegate 
LAUZUN 7052 Yes. 
BOWER 7053 Now go to the ed of January, 1794
LAUZUN 7054 The first is the election of delegates I believe, I need not read them over; the first resolution was to remove the committee rvom to No. 8, New Compton: street; to remove the meeting of delegates to No. 3, New Comptonstreet; then a resolution was passed, that no person but what had belonged three months to the society, was eligible to be elected a delegate; it was agreed to draw up a handbill, approving of the conduct of the delegates in Scotland, anda censure on the magistrates; to distribute one thousand in Edinburgh. 
BOWER 7055 Was this a delegate meeting 
LAUZUN 7056 Yes, to censure the conduct of the magistrates; to distribute one thousand in Edinburgh, and they were to be sent down immediately. 
BOWER 7057 How soon were they to be sent down
LAUZUN 7058 I o the best of my recollection the urgenc was explained to be very great; and I thinke they were to be sent down the following night. A letter was read from Shefiield, signed William Brown Broomhead, chairman, recommending some spirited resolutions to be adopted to support the delegates immediately. i 
ERSKINE 7059 Read that again
LAUZUN 7060 A report read from Sheffield, William Brown Broome head, chairman ; it recommends some spirited resolutions to be adopted to support the delegates immediately, and it likewise says, that at this meeting there were about two thousand ; T believe that is all at that meeting ; the next J have is the 9th of January, at No. 3, according to the resolution at New Compton street. 
ERSKINE 7061 At which meeting I believe the prisoner was not present, was he
LAUZUN 7062 I am inclined to think he was there, though I have not got his name down, I have the names of a variety of delegates and other people that were to be stewards for a meeting that was to be held on the 20th, I think. 
ERSKINE 7063 What passed at the meeting ? if you find any thing to enable you to say that the prisoner was there, we will take it down; if not, we will take it that he was not there
LAUZUN 7064 A general meeting to be at one o’clock, on ths 2vth instant, to meet Mr. Gerrald, and havea dinner at five o'clock, at the Globe-tavern im the Strand. 
ERSKINE 7065 One o'clock, on what day 
LAUZUN 7066 On the guth of January, a sub-committee was formed for management of this matter; the subcommittee that undertook the management of it from the 9th to the 29th, were Thelwall, Franklow, and Stiff; the names of the stewards are, Sohn Thelwall, John Agar. John Agar, have you the christian names at full length in your minutes ?—I may be mistaken in the christian name, which has sometimes happened, but I have it John Agar, and Srewart Kydd, barristers, John Lovett, H. F. Harrison, T. Stiff, Bartholomew Peacock, J. Philip Franklow, Thomas Harris, C. Sinclair, J. Powell, W. Williams, Thomas Mitchel, John Pearce, Matthew Moore, Wm. Moffatt, and J. Martin, attorney. 
ERSKINE 7067 Did you see Wm. Moffatt —Wm. Moffatt, it was said was a delegate of the convention at Edinburgh “ Agreed, that tickets for the dinner should be five shillings, those that dined were to pay five and sixpence, and those that did not dine, paid six-pence for those tickets. 
ERSKINE 7068 Have you any minute of any sub-comanittee 
LAUZUN 7069 A sub-committee to draw up a letter, and send to all the socicties, to unite them all in one general sense in an address to the public, on their invaded rights by the proceedings of the magistrates at Edinburgh. It was mentioned at that meeting, that they should discuss the conduct of the right honourable Mr. Dundas, respecting the trials of the delegates in Edinburgh. 
ERSKINE 7070 Who were to be the sub-committee for the ses of Wrawing up this letter, and discussing his conduct
LAUZUN 7071 I have not got down the names of the committee. 
EYRE 7072 Was it a different sub-committee, from the sub-committee that was to man the dinner
LAUZUN 7073 Yes; the next minute thatIhave got, is of the 20th of January, at the Globe-tavern. 
BOWER 7074 Have you no farther minutes of the business of the 9th of January; you are not yet come to the sub-committee; is that a minute of that day, or of the 20th of January
LAUZUN 7075 It is on the same day a subcommittee to be chosen. 
BOWER 7076 Does it appear that any sub-committee was chosen on that day
LAUZUN 7077 There was a sub-committee chosen, but I have not got down their names. 
BOWER 7078 Was there any plan agreed upon to be proposed, on the 20th of January, respecting the proceedings of this sub-committee
LAUZUN 7079 I have read over what I have got down, and I recollect nothing more. 
BOWER 7080 You stated, that you ceased to be a delegate from Midsummer, to near Christmas, how came you to cease to be a delegate during that time 
LAUZUN 7081 I ceased to be a delegate, in consequence of one ef the London Corresponding Society, makingareport some time before, that I was a spy upon the society, and I was tried in consequence of it, I think on the 13th of June, I was tried by the committee of delegates. 
BOWER 7082 What was the result of your trial 
LAUZUN 7083 I was acquitted by a very eee repaid: 
BOWER 7084 aving been acquit a majority, you then wis sn a dele te, before the time you have last been speaking of ?9—I was re-elected, the next meeting I attended was the 2d of January, 1794. 
ERSKINE 7085 When was it that you were reported to be a spy, and were tried
LAUZUN 7086 I think it was the 13th of June. 
ERSKINE 7087 Mr. Bower—Now come 5 the 20th of January; were you present at the meeting at the Globe-taveth, apa the 20th ef January
LAUZUN 7088 Yes, a meeting the 20th of January, athe Globe tavern, J "Martin, president 
ERSKINE 7089 What time did you go to the Globe-tavern that day 
LAUZUN 7090 I went to the Globe Tavern, before the company had assembled, or business began, but I do not recollect precisely the hour they were assembling, so far I havea very clear recollection, in the one pair of stairs room, and that in the course of their consultation, and talking with each other, that the floor of the room gave way, and created a vast deal of confusion. 
ERSKINE 7091 In consequence of that, I suppose, they did not stay in the room; after the floor gave way, where did they go next
LAUZUN 7092 To the room above. 
ERSKINE 7093 Were you there at any time in the afternoon 
LAUZUN 7094 I was there before the business began, and I was there till the business was finished, and the resolutions at that time were read, indeed I have a report of it here. 
ERSKINE 7095 After the floor of that room had given way, and it was necessary therefore, that they should adjourn, and they had got into the room above stairs, where did the chairman, if there was any, place himself; what was the situation of the chairman
LAUZUN 7096 There is a place for the musicians, at the side of the room, 0

JURYMEMBER 7120 What was meant by opening the divisions to all parts
LAUZUN 7121 The opening of those divisions was, to endeavour to have meeting houses all over London, of different divisions of the so ciety, those that lived nearest to a place of meeting, it was recommended to them to attend at the meeting nearest to them, for the urpose of collecting friends round about near that place where that division met, and so all round London. 
JURYMEMBER 7122 Were any number of persons stated or agreed upon to compose these several meetin the same room, however I will not say that positively, but 1 did not dine with the large company; I was in an adjoining room with a few of the company who could not get seats ; I came into the large room after I had dined.

BOWER 7132 Hardy was present. 
GIBBS 7133 But he is speaking of conversation that passed from people there, whom jhe cannot name.

BOWER 7142 How muchwasto be subscribed 
LAUZUN 7143 As much as they could prevail upon them to subscribe. Division No. 8, in Rotherhithe, wished to know if they shouldremove into the Borough, having had a constable with them, many have lost their business, and are afraid of pressBangs. The next was the call of the house. 
BOWER 7144 hat do you mean by the callof the-house 
LAUZUN 7145 The delegates attended the call of th house, ‘ , 
BOWER 7146 Go on to the next after that
LAUZUN 7147 A motion was made by Thelwall that there should be a Permanent committee of delegates to consider of measures to be pursued during the present posture of affairs, and to be a secret one ; those of the feat committee of delegates chose, to be filled up by other delegates, and they were to be invested with a discretionary power to report to the committee. 
BOWER 7148 To what committee —To the committee of delegates; but the committee of delegates had a power to dissolve them when they pleased. 
BOWER 7149 ‘Was it mentioned of whom the secret committee were to consist 
LAUZUN 7150 They were Martin, Baxter, Williams, Thelwall, and Moore; that was carried unanimously. 
BOWER 7151 Was there any secretary appointed to the secret committee 
LAUZUN 7152 None, 
BOWER 7153 What was to be the. power of the secret committee
LAUZUN 7154 The secret committee was to consider of what measures were necessary to be adopted at that time, and so long as they should sit, according to the measures that were adopted in the House of Commons. 
BOWER 7155 What were they to do, were they themselves tocarry any measure into effect, or how were they to act
LAUZUN 7156 The secret committee was to have a power to call the general committee of delegates together when they saw it was Necessary, and at any time, or at any place. This was agreed to also. 
BOWER 7157 What was the next thing that was carried
LAUZUN 7158 A sub-committee of three to consider of the best mode to increase subscriptions for the delegates in Scotland ; this was referred to the secret committee with full powers, 
BOWER 7159 What was the next thing done 
LAUZUN 7160 There was a letter from Margarot,.but I have no memorandum whether it was read or not. 
BOWER 7161 Nor of the substance of it, have you
LAUZUN 7162 No. 
BOWER 7163 Then go on to the next
LAUZUN 7164 It was proposed by Thelwall that a committee of two, as a committee of exigence, should report tothe general committee. 
BOWER 7165 How was that committee of exigence to be formed, two from all the societies, or how to be formed 
LAUZUN 7166 I have it down herewA committee of two as a committee of exigence to report to the general committee, but not to publish any thing: but this was withdrawn— T have here a letter dated the 28th of January 1794, from Old Friends New Revived, that they had collected as many friends as pussible, and would publish their sentiments; that they are increasing the Bristol Society for Constitutional Information. 
BOWER 7167 Old Friends New Revived 
LAUZUN 7168 They describe themselves so in the letter.—On the 6th of February there was a meeting of delegates. 
BOWER 7169 Was Mr. Hardy there
LAUZUN 7170 Yes, he was.— The first thing that was mentioned there wa that a letter was received from citizenwith respect to his going down to Rotherhithe, on account of the society established there being disturbed.—Motion from the permanent committee to nominate others in their places, it being a secret committee, and those that are to appointed are not to be known. This was brought forward by the secret com mittee, eaying that being a secret commit tee they had found out that it was danger. ous, and therefore they applied to the committee of delegates to dissolve them, and give them power to choose another commit tee in their place; and they likewise requested that they might not be compelled to name the names of those persons that were to form the new committee, Division, No. 11, recommended the committee to consider of the stuation of Hodson and his wife, he was os among the felons, and deprived of seeing his friends: this was sent back on account of the lowness of our funds, being obliged to support our delegates. 
BOWER 7171 What delegates

Resolved, that fifty thovsand hand-bills of lord Stanhope’s speech respecting the foreing troops be printed ; to return him thanks, and to engrave the doctrine : directed myself to the business, I shall answer upon our hearts, and transmit it to our posterity. 
BOWER 7175 After this time you ceased to be a delegate, or shortly afte: 
LAUZUN 7176 Yes. 
BOWER 7177 This is the substance of what you collected during the time you were a delegate —Yes. 
BOWER 7178 How became you a member of this society
LAUZUN 7179 By mere accident. 
BOWER 7180 tis your business
LAUZUN 7181 An ironmonger, and in the commission line. 
BOWER 7182 How did you become a member
LAUZUN 7183 I was at the sign of the Mansion-house, when the division No. 12, had a meeting there ; I knew nothing at all of it, but the landlord had one of their printed resolutions given to him, and I. requested the favour of looking at it, and upon seeing it, my remark to him was, that it was a society formed for overturning the constitution of this country, and I advised him by no means tosuffer them to meet there any more, for if he did, he would certainly have his licence taken away. 
BOWER 7184 Then you made yourself a member of the society; how did you get admitted 
LAUZUN 7185 I went up to the society the same evening along with two other gentlemen that were there. I understood that any person might go into the poom ; there had been two or three had attempted it, therefore they appointed a door keeper to admit none but those that were members ; one of the society endeavoured to turn me out, however I went in, and had some conversation with the president, whose, name was Watson, and who was at that time supto be secretary to lord George Gordon ; 
BOWER 7186 we were chi a iyeerpune the com
BOWER 7187  Las lon of the society, saying, 
BOWER 7188 Paid not mean to do any thing of the kind, but understanding the society was on a public 
BOWER 7189 I should much obliged to them for one of theirresolutions, and then I should leave them to their own deliberations. 
BOWER 7190 Then you were admitted a member in conuence of what you had observed 
LAUZUN 7191 Yes; the following night, in Newgate-street. 
ERSKINE 7192  Mr. Erskine.—I have very little to trouble you with, for Mr. Bower has very kindly put the questions to you which I was disposed to put; I think you say you are in the commission line
LYNAM 7193 what sort of commission line?—Both in the Birmingham and Sheffield. 
ERSKINE 7194 At this moment are you 
LYNAM 7195 Not now. 
ERSKINE 7196 How long is it since you were in this commission line
LYNAM 7197 I have been in the commission line, and am in the sada line now. 
ERSKINE 7198 I thought you said a moment ago, not now —I have aaanority to sell by commission from different people, but Ido not keep, or have any stock left with meby any manufacturer at the present moment. 
ERSKINE 7199 I should think you have hardly leisure to concern yourself with those sort of transactions, have you
LYNAM 7200 TI have certainly leisure, and if I am to answer you how it is that I have you in a very candid manner, and tell you, that Iam making an application for a business in the East-India line ; thatis, to attend at the coffee-houses to take orders from the captains and mates, and different officers on’ board, but I dothat business on my own ac-" count. 
ERSKINE 7201 How long is it since you first conceived this plan,—it certainly is a reputable one, and I don’t find fault with it; how long is it since you set yourself to this inquiry
LYNAM 7202 In a small degree I have done it for I suppose these seven years. 
ERSKINE 7203 Taking orders for captains and mates, and so on, ina small degree
LYNAM 7204 Yes; till the last season. 
ERSKINE 7205 How long is it since you did any business of that sort 
LYNAM 7206 The last season. 
ERSKINE 7207 And the season before, and so on, for the last seven years
LYNAM 7208 I never did so much as I did the last season. 
ERSKINE 7209 You were an ironmonger originally !—Yes ; I was brought up to that. 
ERSKINE 7210 Where might your shop be 
LYNAM 7211 I first of all had a warehouse in Wood-street ; I removed from oe house in Wood street to another, and from thence to Walbrook, where I have been ever since. 
ERSKINE 7212 Lm keepa shop open there now of course 
LYNAM 7213 Yes. 
ERSKINE 7214 You do
LYNAM 7215  Yes. 
ERSKINE 7216 You have always kept your shop open then notwithstandiag this collateral business at the East-India house, in the commission line 
LYNAM 7217 I have always kept a warehouse for wholesale business ; 1 have never been in the retail way since I left Shrimpton and company. 
ERSKINE 7218 You were very much alarmed for the safety of the constitution of the country upon reading a paper I think that your landlord had shown you
LYNAM 7219 Yes. 
ERSKINE 7220 spauld you know that paper if you saw it
LYNAM 7221 Yes. 
ERSKINE 7222 It isthe “ Resolutions I believe
LYNAM 7223 Yes; the resolutions and address. It is the address that was brought out after the original one I stated in the month of March 1792, that was too small; afterwards it became more voluminous, and it has been made use of from that time to the present. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7224 I should suppose it was that of the 2d of May 
LYNAM 7225 No; it was the 24th of May, 1792. 
ERSKINE 7226 [showing a printed paper to the witness] is that the paper
LYNAM 7227 Yes, it is, 
ERSKINE 7228 You were alarmed, and immediately said to your landlord, that this was a society which would bring on the destruction of this constitution, and of course, asa good subject, you immediately set yourself to inquire into it, and to become a member for that purpose 
LYNAM 7229 Yes. 
ERSKINE 7230 I need not ask you, because it follows of course, that in order to on that plan, it was necessary that you shopld seem to think as they did
LYNAM 7231 Yes. 
ERSKINE 7232 You were elected a delegate 
LYNAM 7233 Yes. 
ERSKINE 7234 And you contiaued a delegate until the 48th of June, 1793 
LYNAM 7235 Yes; as near as I can give you any intelligence. 
ERSKINE 7236 Then you fell under suspicion, you were oo and were acquitted by a majority 
LYNAM 7237 Yes. 
ERSKINE 7238 And pray, sir, if I might so far inquire into the forms-of your trial, was the trial upon evidence, or were you acquitted upon any declaration of your own
LYNAM 7239 I was tried upon evidence ; I was tried upon evidence that was brought forward at the meeting of the deleates. 8 Were you asked whether there was any foundation for that charge or no ?—There were four or five gentlemen brought forward to the committee of delegates to prove that I was nota friend to the society ; it took up a long consideration, and it was verv late before we parted, and after hearing all that they could say, and from whence arose that suspicion, I was honourably acquitted. I have got down the names of my accusers, in the course of my minutes, but I did not take any kind of notice of it, not thinking it necessary. 
ERSKINE 7240 Then being honourably acquitted, you continued to attend the society regularly? I was discontinued as 4 delegate; I believe I served out for that quarter, but in that month I went down into Staffordshire, and into York-shire, upon business, upon an order that I had from America. 
ERSKINE 7241 At what time did you first communicate to any magistrate that you were in the course of this inquiry, and whether you furnished them, or any particular magistrate, from time to time, with the notes you have been reading in court 
LYNAM 7242 I consulted with a friend, and informed him that there were such and such societies about London. 
ERSKINE 7243 Iam not asking you what you informed a friend—It is necessary I should state it; I should be sorry for saying any thing that is wrong, and I wish the world at large should know my reason for doing it ; I did not do it of myselt, but by advice ; it was a gentleman that I had received friendship from at the west end of the town; he recommended me by all means to make a report of it; I did make a report of it, and have done. 
ERSKINE 7244 y And you have done from time to time
LYNAM 7245 Yes. 
ERSKINE 7246 When was the first of those reports made? I believe the first report that I made must be in the month of October, 1792. 
ERSKINE 7247 ‘I shall not at present ask you who that person was, and whether the report you made was to any person entrusted with any public station or merely to a private friend, to any person invested with magistracy so as to act upon it
LYNAM 7248 I do not know how far I am at liberty to answer this question; I made my reports toa person ina quarter that I was well satisfied that a proper knowledge would be had; whether it is by a magistrate, or whether by any body else, it makes no difference, I was satisfied ia my mind that these societies would be known by those reports. 
ERSKINE 7249 If you had told me that it was any body vested with any public magistracy, 1 would not have asked, but having said it is nota person in that situation, Lask to whom it was 
LYNAM 7250 I have nat said so. 
ERSKINE 7251 I wish then to repeat my question 
LYNAM 7252 I said I would answer it in the best manner I possibly could, and that is, whether it was a maistrate or any other person, I was satisfied om the quarter I gave my information to, that it was well known that there were these societies. 
ERSKINE 7253 Did you hear my question 
LYNAM 7254 Yes. 
ERSKINE 7255 Then surely you could not consider that as an answer if you did; I put this questioa— was the person to whom you communicated your reports in the month of October 1799, 3 magistrate of any species or description, from a justice of the peace to a secretary of state? 
ERSKINE 7256 Lynam
LYNAM 7257 tIf 1 am by your lordship’s direction to answer this question directly, I certainly will. 
EYRE 7258 I think you mav say that it was or not toa magistrate 
LYNAM 7259 It was not to a magistrate. 
ERSKINE 7260 Then to whom was it ? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7261 I object to that question being put ; the principle which admits that it ought not to be asked if it were to a magistrate, admits that it ought not to be asked as to any body else ; for my part J cannot see what it has todo with the justice of the case. 3 
ERSKINE 7262 I am surprised at this ob. jection; is this man to be let loose for seven hours with written papers, and am I not to be permitted to try bie credit? when he says that in the month of October, 179a, he informed a person of these transactions, am T not to be permitted to ask him who the person is to whom he made those reports? if he answers it was to such an individual, may I not call that individual in order to show peradventure, that these reports had no existence at that time, or that he did not show them to the person named? I shall be perfectly satisfied with whatever judgment the Court please to pronounce upon this occasion, but I certainly think it my duty to insist upen the question. 
EYRE 7263 It is perfectly right that all opportunities should be given to discuss the truth of the evidence given against a prisoner; but there is a rule whieh has universally obtained on account of its impostance to the public for the detection of crimes, that those persons who are the channel by means of which that detection is made, should not be unnecessarily disclosed: if it can be made appear that really and truly it is neeessary to the investigation of the truth ef the case that the name of the person should be disclosed, I should be very unwilling to stop it, but it does not appear to me that it is withia the ordinary ceurse to do it, or that nally put, your lordsbips will permit me first to state what was the fact at the time that this objection arose. My learned friend asked the witness, whether the person to whom he made the Communication was or was not a magietrate? As 1 understood the answer of the witness, it was to this effect; that he ghere is any necessity for it in this particularcase; all that this witness say6 is, I did this upon advice; I did from time to time communicate with a friend for the purpose of its being communicated to & magistrate, and in that manner it was that I eame to know these transactions. 
EYRE 7264 If there is a rule that the channel by which those communications are made should not be disclosed, that rule I think will extend to this case: I rather think that we have this day determined that there is such a rule, 
EYRE 7265 I cannot satisfy myself that there is any substantial distinction between the ease of this man’s going to a justice of the peace, Or oing to a magistrate superior to a justice of the watched by those whose duty it was to attend to it, The question immediately put upon that was, ifit wasneta magistrate, who was it? 
EYRE 7266 Now I know I ought tostate with great dif fidence, any opinion of mine upon a question of evidence, not having for years any of the courts of law, not knowing what the practice of the courts is at thie day, and not being therefore able to state from principle what rule is to be deduced from that practice ; but in the course of the early period of my life I have had a good deal to do with this sort of business in the courts of law, and lordships, the way in which the question was I beg humbly to state my own opinion, that put to the witness by Mr. Erskine, sas inif the rule with respect to asking & question order to sift his credit, whether what he saidof a witness be that he is to disclose the now was what be had always said; he askedchannel of communication to a magistrate, him this, not who employed him, but whotherthat a question porotng at persons who stand he had communicated to any body what hein situations, where they cannot be strietly had observed at the meetings of these socie- stated as acting as magistrates, but at the ties; his answer was, that be had eommuni-same time bave respect to the publie office of cated it to a friend: Now with great submis- magistracy, 18question that is not to be put. sion to your lordships, it is the common| My friend says, ought I not to try the practice, that when a man’s credit is sifted by credit of the witness? 1 happen, in the habit being asked whether he bas ever told theof my own profession for the last six years, 10 same story to another person, and he says heknow the practice in the court fof exchequer ; bas told jt toa particular person, he is alwaysit is 2 sort ‘of thing that occurs every dmyself.a asked who that particular person in, if thewitness say, L had an information that the gentleman who is examining him thinks it defendant bad committed an offence againet worth while to press the examination to thatthe revenue laws, for which he would incur a extent. forfeiture of thirty thousand pounds, if

I say then, that the objection to W ith respect to what has been stated, as thethe yestion now proposed to be put,—always principle upon which the question was origi-stating that objection with the utmost deference to your lordships, which I do from a sense of duty founded upon what I think the clearest principle of duty to every individual who forms a part of the community—I state this—that after the witness has distinctly said that he mentioned this to a person who was to communicate it to those who would necessarily take care of the interests of society, in consequence of that information being communicated, that that channel of communication brings the name ofthat person within the tule the Court has laid down. 
BULLER 7271 Did the witness say he mentioned it to this friend for the purpose of its being communicated to a public officer? 
ERSKINE 7272 No. 
GROSE 7273 “J am satisfied that from the quarter where I gave my information the societies would be known; I believe those were the words. 
EYRE 7274 I have it thus: “ He made a report to one, who, he was certain, would communicate it, but not toa istrate. 
GIBBS 7275 I think he said before that, “ I consulted with a friend who recommended it to me. 
EYRE 7276 He did so. 
ERSKINE 7277 The manifestation of innocence is as great a principle in the administration of justice as the punishment of crimes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7278  Most surely. 
ERSKINE 7279 I will go back again, with the permission of the Court, in my examination. You told me that in the month of October, 1792, you made a report; by making a report, do yuu mean that you showed that book to any body in November, 1792, from which you have been now reading
LYNAM 7280 I did: not. Your original question was, to know how it was that I gave a communication; there has been a misunderstanding, how it was that I did give any information; I told you I was advised by a friend to give a communication, and that from him I was recommended to give that communication, and I gave it in a quarter—I believe these were the express words—I gave it in a quarter that I was well satisfied that it would be known, that there were these sort of societies in London; the mistake that has beenmade is, that I ial rare d communicated with this gentleman that I first of all consulted: I never saw that gentleman afterwards, but the channel, the dearer that he directed me to, I pursued all the way through. 
ERSKINE 7281 You were advised by a triend, to whom, no doubt, you had communicated what you knew, to make that communication to a person whom that friend recommended ? —Just so. 
ERSKINE 7282 Was that friend, who advised you to make that representation, a magistrate '—No. 
ERSKINE 7283 Then who was that friend? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7284 I really must object to the question. 
ERSKINE 7285 My question is not—who the person is to whom his friend recommended him to make the’ communication, because he has said that the ee he went to, by the recommendation of his friend, was a channel from whence government was likely to be informed; therefore I did not mean to put any question in the teeth of what the Court have resolved: but I have only this to say, that I was not present in the morning when your lordships determined it. M juestion now is, who was the friend (which riend was not a magistrate) who did advise the witness to make the communication to “Lord Chief Soatce Fagre-tF the pein ief Justice If the princi be right, I am of opinion it exteaile to tet Gone because the disclosing who the iend was that advised him to go to a magistrate, is a thing which puts-that friend-in a situation into which he ought not to be put, and into which it is inconvenient to general justice that he should be put. 
ERSKINE 7286 Supposing, for instance, that T were in possession of evidence, .but which I could not pocetly proteas to contradict this witness, that he made no such communication to any living being at that time; that this is all an invention and fabrication (I state it only for augument’s sake, which I have a right to do), baw aki yeenble I should do it, if I cannot allo to extract from the witness who the person was to whom he made the communication, and who advised him to give information to some other person? It will be asked, is it an honourable thine? Is it to be ai that, in this country, law and the liberty of the suede I trust, that the law and the liberty of the subject will always go together, and I hope in that the time will never arrive when the huzzas of popularity shall be against the vernment and administration, but that government and administration shall be so conducted as to carry along with them those huzzas of popularity which always attend s government well administered—if that be so, all I want to know is, that which can expose no man to contumely, namely, that he has advised a person, who tells him that he has discovered something, which, erroneously or otherwise, he conceives to be a conspiracy against the public, and, he says, go to a magistrate 
ERSKINE 7287 Suppose I were to advise any man who told me he had discovered something which he thought the public were interested im knowing; I be id say, Iam bert Tam no magistrate, I advise you to go to the secretary of state, and tell it; should I think I was at all brought in question for having given an advice i could stand to in the face of the whole world? how then can the public be affected by it, if I was to go on to ask him afterwards, who is that friend to whom you made that communication ? Ifit were not for what the Court has already pronounced, I should say, that the same argument will even go farther, namely, that if I were to call upon the man to whom he made the communication, I could not extract from that man any thing he said, but I could ask that man, did the witness make the communication to you? Su the witness says, I communicated this in the month of November, 1792, to Mr. White, the solicitor of the treasury, should not I have a right to ask the solicitor of the treasury, whether that fact were true or no? I could not go on to ask Mr. White what he did communicate to him, but I could ask him, whether, in point of fact, he did communicate it to him? And if he were to say, I never saw the man in the month of November, 1792, at all; I got the communication from another channel ; I never saw his face till I saw him in this court, would not that shake the credit of the witness with any man of understanding? I apprehend it would. 
ERSKINE 7288 It seems to me, therefore, with the greatest submission to the court, that the public is guarded by that distinction; and, in the course of the discharge of my duty at the bar, I hope I shall so distinguish the cases, that, in preserving the lives and liberties of those who are to be tried, the law and constitution of the country may thrive along with them ; and they never can thrive unless they thrive together. I think there is wholesome justice init. All 1 propose to ask this witness is the first question ; L cannot ask the second, because I will not attempt to ask what the Court has decided must not be asked ; I submit he must state the name of the person to whom he communicated it; then have I not a right to subpcena that person? I will then ask, when did you tell it him? at what place? who were present? Then I ask that person, is it true? But if I were to go on farther, and ask, what did he communicate? in order to try the truth of this writing, there your lordships would stop me. I apprehend that is the distinction. 
GIBBS 7289 I submit to your lordships whether this is not the distinction: That where an informer in the Exchequer proceeds upon an information of facts—communicated by another person, that he should not be called upon to disclose the person giving him the information: But it is perfectly new to me, I confess. I have no doubt it is my ignorance, I mean blameable ignorance, because I ought to be better informed in my profession; bat I never have met with an inStance in which it has been objected to asking a witness, upon cross-examination, who the person was to whom he communicated a fact that he states, because it happens that the person to whom he did communicate that fact, did advise him to communicate it farther to a magistrate. I know it is established in the court, in which your lordship long presided, that where an informer has communicated facts to a person, and that person has acted upon the communication of those facts, they cannot ask who brought those facts to his kyowledge ; but ;" you ask a witness whether he has communicated it to any other rson, and he tells you he has, whose name e does not mention, because he says that person advised him to communicate it toa 
GIBBS 7290 Magistrate. I think it never has been held, in a court of justice, that that was an objection to the question. 
EYRE 7291 There is some doubt in the court how the fact stands; whether, in consequence of the first advice that he received from his friend, he disclosed those circumstances to the same friend, by whom he supposes it to be communicated regularly to some magistrate; or whether he applicd to some other person. I understood him that he applied to some other person himself. 
MACDONALD 7292 My reason for wishing him to be asked, whether the person, to whom he originally made the comMunication, was a istrate or not, was exactly upon the same principle as my lord chief justice now states. I could wish it to be distinctly known, whether the person to whom he first mentioned it was the person who communicated it to a magistrate, or a person who simply advised him to communicate it to a magistrate. ay. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7293 I wish to have it understood that the objection I now take is this: That Mr. Erskine has no right to ask the witness who it was that advised him to ive the information to a person who stands in the situation of a magistrate; for, I say, the person by whose advice the information is given, is to all intents and purposes, the informer. I wish to explain myself; who this person was, and what effect it may have in the evidence, it may be impertinent to sug gest; what it is intended to prove, really I not know; but your lordships will recollect that I stand here as the prosecutor for the public ; if I were in my own cause I could sacrifice, at my own pleasure, principles which appear to me to be the principles of public justice ; but, in the situation in which I stand, I do not know how I can regulate my conduct better towards the public, and towards thepaca than by acting upon the principles of law, as Iunderstand them, admitting at the same time, that no man is more likely to be mistaken: but this I will say distinctly, that I would not trouble your lordship with the ob jection that I am now stating, if I were not rfectly convinced, upon the best judgment Pax form, that the question cannot be put to the witness; and 1 mean, according to my duty, and with very humble deference to your lordships, to beg to have your lordships’ opinion. — 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7294 I know very well that it may be strongly argued, as it is very strongly argued by my learned friends, why, how are we to find out whether a witness does or does not speak truth, if we cannot ask him this sort of question—who advised you to do so and su? Suppose he says Mr. White, the solicitor for the treasury, should not I call upon that gentleman
LYNAM 7295 not, says my learned friend (and i wish your lordships to try this reasoning), not to ask what were the particulars of the communication, but to ask the fact, whether this person did or did not advise with him in the year 1792? Now what is the reason that you cannot ask the particulars of the advice? The vety same reason why you cannot ask to the fact, whether he advised with him or not, videlicet, that im the given case it supposed a principle of public justice, which overbalances the private mischief that happens in the case stated. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7296 In the Court of Exchequer it unquestionably happens every day, that a witness says I received an information that there were run-goods at such a place, I went there, and found them. There it is impossible to deny that the reasoning is just, which says, that the credit of a witness may be tried by asking bim, whom did you receive the informetion from? where ; under what circumstances ? andif the man were bound te answer to those questions, and he had spoken falsely, with respect to the when and the where he had received it, er under what circumstances, if it rested upon his evidence, wher you had falsified it with respect te the preceding perticuJars, yow could not believe him. gs to the subsequent particalars, and the defendant must be acquitted. Nobody will deny but that it is a case, but it has become a settled rule, beeause private mischief gives way to lic convenience ; and it is an hardship which occursin particular cases, in consequence of the Necessities of public justice. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7297 To explain amyselt, witbowk making an professions respocting my own conduct, might fairly say, I ought to have my gown stripped off my back, if I, acting upon any thing but coaviction that I am right upon principle, and a principle that 3 cannot, in my situation, sacrifice—suppose the prisoner Now trymg, im the course of a transaction of thas kind, where the consequence of his being copwicted was notwhatitis in this sort of case, but that which, with respect to his pecuniary fortune, would ruin him over and over again, the abstract justice of the case is exactly the same; and yet it is quite clear that that direct question, who gave you information, in consequence of which you prosecute for those penalties which are to ruin the defendant? could not be asked. Then I ask this, whether, in common sense, and upon principle, the man who advises him to inform, is not substantially and really the inftormer—and whether the principle ot law, which has said that you cannot ask this question, because the consequence of asking the question will be, that those who may not have nerves so strong as nvy friend and. myself, who would not care aa farthing if our names were mentioned ; but great numbers of persons in the world would not choose to have their names mentioned on such occasions; and with respect to that feeling, call it fear, or imprudent reserve, n is a substantial principle in Jaw, that aman shall not have his name disclosed. I have thought it my duty thus to state the grounds of my objection. I have made it, ecause I am convinced the objection is right; when E state that, your lordship will easily believe, I do not mean to contend that it is right, because I am convinced it is right, but because I cannot, I think, discharge my duty to the public without stating my objection as I feel the objection; and in cases of this great weight and importance, and indeed in any case, I do not know how the attorney general of the country can proceed more safely than according to his own notions; they may be mistaken ones, but according to his own notions of what the rule of justice is. 
EYRE 7298 I, for my own part, adhere to my opinion. I think we must stand upon the principle, and that when we tun into very nice distinctions upon a principle, we get into difficulties from whence I never know how to disentangle myself, or to relieve my mind. The question is, whether, if it be opposed, any of the channels, by which this information and discovery comes to the officers of the crown, should be unecessarily disclosed? Isay unnecessarily, because it is no part of this fact at all whether this man did or did not mention this circumstance to this friend of his, or whether this friend of his gave him any particular advice. The only way in which it is permitted to be asked, is, because it may enable the defendant, by drawing out circumstances collateral to the fact, to establish a contradiction to the witness upon those collateral circumstances, and so to affect his credit. Now that would be true of every question that the wit of man could suggest; yet, undoubtedly, there are many questions which, even upon a crossexamination, a counsel is not permitted to ask. My apprehension is, that among those questions whch are not permitted to be asked, are all those questions which tend to the discovery of the channels by whom the disclosure was made to the officers of justice ; that it is upon the gencral principle of the convenience of public justice not to be disclosed ; that all persons in that situation are protected from the discovery; and that, if it is objected to, itis no more competent for the defendant to ask who the person was that advised him tomake 3 disclosure, than it is to whom he made the disclosure in consequence of that advice—than it is to ask any other question respecting the channel of communication, or all that was done underit. I never can distinguish, formy own part, the oases; if my brothers are satisfied there is sucha distinction, I shail be glad to submit to their opinion; but I think the principle extends to this case ; for, undoubtedly, an immediate answer to the question puts the person who gave this advice, into the situation desccibed by Mr. Attorney General, of being, in substance, the imformer to government of this transaction which this man discloses. I am of opinion, therefore. within the general rule upon this subject, the question ought not to be asked. 
EYRE 7299 Lord Chief Baron Macdonald —Iit seems you are agreed now with respect to this tact, namely, that the person, to whom the witness says he made the first disclosure, was neither a magistrate, nor any person concerned in the executive government of the country, and that from that person he received advice no longer to apply himself to him, because that was of no use, but that he should apply himself to some person, either in a magisterial character, or in some way concerned in the government of the country. There is no rule more sacred, undoubtedly, than that you ought not to ask any witness a question by which it should be disclosed to what magistrates or officer of the executive government he gave communication; and were I satisfied that the friend, to whom he disclosed this matter, was in any way a link in the communication, or a channel truly and substantially in the communication, I should certainly think that rule applied to him. On the other hand, it scems to me that upon a cross-examination it is material, when a person at a distance of time gives an account of transactions, to know whether it was then for the first time that he gave that account, or whether he gave that account recently after the transaction, or when he gave it, as that is a matter from whence important inferences may arise for the defendant. 
EYRE 7300 I think that that question should be asked, unless there should be a very great public inconvenience on the other side, which renders it much better for public justice in general, that the defendant should Josethe benefit of that question. In the particular instance it does appear to me, that a person not executing magistracy is in no situation to make it dangerous. A mere private peree simply saying,:do not come to me, but go to some person that can be of use, I think—as no possible disadvantage can arise in a case of that kind—it is a fair question to be asked, in order to ascertain huw a matter of this sort, alarming him, and attracting his attention, was or not revealed by him. I mean to draw the line distinctly in this way, that this person not being connected either with magistracy, or the executive government, it does not seem to me, in point of fact, to fall within the rule, which rule I hold sacred. 
HOTHAM 7301 The witness has said, he communicated this to his friend, under an impression and full persuasion that through him the intelligence which he gave was to he conveyed to a magistrate; that he has distinctly said. Now the question, as it seems to me, does turn upon the principles of public policy. I confess, for my own part, that upon those principles E cannot see any distinction between making a disclosure to the magistrate himself, or making it to any person who is to communicate that disclosure to the magisgrate; the principle is, that public justice demands, in many cases, that sort of secrecy, without which government could not be carried on. There are many cases, we all know, where it is of the last importance to us all, that such secrecy should be observed; and it is admitted on all hands, that if the communication is made to a magistrate, you shall not oblige the witness to disclose who that magistrate is; that is for the purpose of public justice to the country. Now here this man has communicated to his friend for the purpose, and under the persuasion of his going directly to a magistrate, being advised by him to do what he did. I cannot myself, I confess, distinguish the situation of that friend from the situation of a common informer, and we know very well that it would not be Permintat to ask that question of him—here I consider this (I am sorry to differ from my lord chief baron) as a link of the same chain; I do consider that it makes no sort of difference whether the intelligence is directly conveyed to the magistrate, or by more indirect means; the purpose for whieh it is disclosed to this man is, that of being conveyed to the magistrate; and I think upon principle that public justice would be defeated if such a thing was allowed. 
BULLER 7302 Cases have been alluded to respecting offencescommittedagainst the re venue laws, and therefore I paid the utmest attention to what has fallen upon this subject from my, lord chief justice, my lordchief baron, and my brother Hotham, because they are better acquainted with those cases than I am. The principle, as taken from them, I should be dencseh to pay the utmost deference to, and I think I do not differ from my lord chief jastice in the principle he has laid down: perhaps in the application of it I shal) differ only a little, and I fancy my brother Hotham and I differ in the application of the law, rather than in the application of the facts. 
GROSE 7303 In this casc, it seems to me, that we all agree about the principle, the question is, who is right in the application of that principle; for we do most perfectly agree in this principle, that the name of the informer is not to be disclosed : that isthe law stated; that is the law agreed and argued upon by the counsel on both sides. Then the question in this case is, whether this persun, whose name is asked, ig to he considered as the informer. Now the evidence is this; I consulted witha friend, who advised me what to do, and to make a teport. I did so, and I have done it from time to time. Then in consequence of whose advice is it that this isdone? In consequence of this man’s advice, whose name is now asked. If it is in consequence of his advice, I must confess it does seem to me that, essentially and substantially, and according to every idea of good sense, he must be considered to be the informer: But it is very true that, perhaps in the course of this investigation, the name of some other person may be inquired, whose name it may not be competent to ask, and the reason may be this, that in the course of this business there may be more informers. than one, aad ine yume rinciple that applies to one, will a of Lely to the cthlerss and when I find bat the evidence is, that this man advised the witness what to do, I must confess that the witness having acted in consequence of that advice, he seems to me tu be as essentially a pe I nm the informer as any one person can be in-thie case, because if it had not been for his advice, non constat, that this would have been done, I therefore, however unwilling I am, and [aps always exceedingly unwilling in a case where life is at stake to shut the door of evidence, yet where a point of great constitutional law, that which is to affect the public justice of the kingdom is in question, I must decide upon it as my conviction tells me is right, at the same time lamenting that there should be such a difference in the Court as there is now, because I am very willing to confess, that it has not been the habit of my prace tice, never having sat in that court, where those questions most frequently arise, to decide upon those questions; but however the little ability I have I must employ upon the subject; and taking the rule and the principle to be that the name of the informer is not to be disclosed, I can only look to whether this person, whose name is referred to, is the informer or not; he appearing to be essentially the informer, I think, according to the tule of law, the question ought not to be put. 
ERSKINE 7304 Did you communicate any other part to this person from whom you received that advice 
LYNAM 7305 No. 
ERSKINE 7306 Was that before or after you had been at the society 
LYNAM 7307 After.

LYNAM 7309 I communicated it in-the month of October: immediately after I knew that there were societies of this sort, I communicated it to this friend of mine; he is s gentlemen of very considerable property. 
ERSKINE 7310 Let us have nothing about him. Now you know it is not legal to name him, you are ing to give me a description of him
LYNAM 7311 His advice to me was, to give information : this was after I was acquainted that there was such a society as the London Corresponding Society; in consequence of that advice I gave information immediately, which was in the samme month of October, 1792, and I continued it to the month of February. 
ERSKINE 7312 Did you communicate your reports ip writing from time to time 
LYNAM 7313 In writing. 
ERSKINE 7314 Did you givecopies of them 
LYNAM 7315 I gavecopies. 
ERSKINE 7316 You have nothing else, have you, in your book, except that which relates to this busness
LYNAM 7317 I do not immediately recollect, I believe I have some, 
ERSKINE 7318 In that book from which you have been reading most of the day 
LYNAM 7319 I have two of them 
ERSKINE 7320 Ts there any thing that relates to your pr vate business in either of them
LYNAM 7321 I have some private memorandums. 
ERSKINE 7322 Fold them down, if they are loose; we do not want to concern ourselves with your affairs, or any thing that does not relate to this business. Did not you appropriate ee books for this sort of information?}—I 
ERSKINE 7323 id. 
ERSKINE 7324 What leads you then to apprehend tbat there are any other matters riluve to your other business in them 
LYNAM 7325 I have this reason, because I had a communication, and had in- , 
ERSKINE 7326 formation from different gentlemen; and, oc casionally, I made a memorandum ofthat communication, and I should not wish for that to be seen. 
ERSKINE 7327 Look over your book
LYNAM 7328 It is impossible for me to de it in this light ; I will look the book over; I have no objection ; I will go into any room and look it over, andI shall give you ae book with the greatest pleasure imaginable. 
ERSKINE 7329 Tam not asking any favour of you, or wishing for any thing that I am not entitled to have
LYNAM 7330 I do not wish, by any means, to report eny thing but what is absolutely the fact; nor would I wish to withhold any thing that Ido not think is right to be withheld. I know there are some private memorandums, and it is impossible for me to look them through now, while 1 stand here. 
ERSKINE 7331 Then take those out, and let us have the pot to-morrow
LYNAM 7332 I am very ready and willing. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7333 You will attend to what the gentleman says
LYNAM 7334 I1 am pertectly willing. 
ERSKINE 7335 You have some papers that are not mixed with any thing of that sort 
LYNAM 7336 Iam not sure that there are no memorandus of that kind on them. 
ERSKINE 7337 Was it the custom at these meetings of the delegates of the.Corresponding Society forthe members to take -notes of all that passed 
LYNAM 7338 That was always a regular rule. 
ERSKINE 7339 For every delegate to set down every thing that passed 
LYNAM 7340 Sometimes there was a communication which has been conceived by the chairman not proper to be communicated to the divisions; and Margarot has said, you must not communicate this; and as to this book that you are asking for, the delegates were allowed to take reports or information, whether from the chairman, or any of the delegates, either with regard to a letter, or any other matter. The chairman has said, though you are informed such a thing has been wrote or has happened, though you are allowed to take a minute of it, we tell you it is not fit it should be communicated to the divisions; but that notes were allowed to be taken at all times is true. 
ERSKINE 7341 I am not asking what was allowed, but whether it was the practice
LYNAM 7342 It was the practice every nignt. 
ERSKINE 7343 It was the practice for other members to do as you have been doing, to sct down in a loose paper, or in a book, all the transactions that then happened 
LYNAM 7344 It was. 
ERSKINE 7345 And the substance of what every body said 
LYNAM 7346 I have heard of some reports made by other people ; this circumstance might strike me, and another circumstance might strike another, which I might not take particular notice of, or think it worth while to put down. 
ERSKINE 7347 You do not profess that what you have been reading is a regular account of the most material facts that occurred; but that they were such as were most suitable fur your pur
ERSKINE 7348 Pose to set down
LYNAM 7349 I do not know howto answer that question, as you put it, I do conceive that a delegate being sent to know what business the socicty was transacting, that he should take the best account of it that he possibly could. ‘ 
ERSKINE 7350 That was when a man was really a deleate, but you were not there as a real ond fide delegate, but for the purposes of justice 
LYNAM 7351 I was elcoted a delegate, as I statcd, in the beginning of November, 1792, and continued so till the month of June, 1793. 
ERSKINE 7352 T do not seem to make myself understood ; did you set down every thing faithfully that passed, or only select such matter as appeared most material for the public to know
LYNAM 7353 I put: down every thing I possibly could; but I did not put down every thing that did pass, nor was it in the power of any of the delegates to do so; but it was the invariable practice of the delegates to-make minutes cither upon paper, or in books, for the purpose of commu. Dicating what had been transacted at the meeting of delegates at the next division, at their meetings, on different nights, from Thursday to ‘Thursday. 
ERSKINE 7354 Then those are the very reports that you would have made, had you been bund fide a delegate, and dving your duty as such to that society
LYNAM 7355 I made these notes as a real, bond fide delegate to No. 23. I made those reports at that jLvision. 
ERSKINE 7356 Have you been in no other way of dealing, but an ironmonger, and in this commission way? have not you kept a china shopi— Never. 
ERSKINE 7357 When you communicated to this person, who, you thought, would go and communicate it toa magistrate, did you rest satisfied that your friend wonld do so; or did you at any lime go toa magistrate yourself 
LYNAM 7358 I informed you, when you asked me that question, that the information was not given to a magistrate : I tuld you that it was by the advice ofa friend, who confirmed my own opinion, entertained at the first. When I found this society at the sign of the Mansion-house, it was absolutely necessary it should be known; he recommenced me to that quarter, which quarter I was persuaded was that of a certainty. 
EYRE 7359 You are asked a simple question; did you yourself go to any magistrate 
LYNAM 7360 I went to no magistrate; but was advised to go to another quarter, and I went to that quarter. 
EYRE 7361 I wish you would not overpower the counsel or me with words. You are asked a simple question, whether you did, or not, go to a magistrate 
LYNAM 7362 I did not. 
ERSKINE 7363 Did you learn from your friend, whose name I do not ask, whether he had, in point of fact, laid from time to time, the communications before a magistrate, that you laid before him for that purpose 
LYNAM 7364 I gave that information myself, 
ERSKINE 7365 Did you deliver yuur reports, from time to time, to that quarter ; or did youdeliver them immediately to some magistrate 
LYNAM 7366 I sent them to that quarter. 
ERSKINE 7367 When you say that, you mean you sent them ta that person, to whom your friend recommended you to send them ? 
EYRE 7368 He never said that his friend advised him to a particular person ; if he did I have mistaken him. 
ERSKINE 7369 Did your friend advise you to lay them before a particular person 
LYNAM 7370 He xecommended me fo a particular quarter. 
ERSKINE 7371 A quarter; was ita man or a woman
LYNAM 7372 I hat I cannot answer. 
ERSKINE 7373 Not whether it was a man ora woman. 
EYRE 7374 Certainly not. 
ERSKINE 7375 Was it to any particular petson that you were advised, by your friend, to make this communication or did he only advise you generally to make this communication, to somebody 
LYNAM 7376 The best way of explanation is to say, that the person he recommended me to, recommended me to a third erson, and to that third person I gave the information, and continued it all the way through. 
BULLER 7377 Mr. Erskine, you cannot pursue that question farther. 
ERSKINE 7378 How long was it after the time when you were tried and acquitted, before you came to the society again
LYNAM 7379 I attended the society all the way through, though not as a delegate—I was a delegate to February, 1794. 
ERSKINE 7380 1 observe you do not take down who it was that made use of any particular expressions 
LYNAM 7381 In the course of the memorandums that I have made, I have got names. 
ERSKINE 7382 I know you have—in general in your book you do not profess to have taken down the words, but only the substance 
LYNAM 7383 Yes. 
ERSKINE 7384 Ifa person delivered any opinion, which opinion might be at some length, you made the best abstract of it that you could, merely to say that that was his opinion or his argument
LYNAM 7385 It is so; names are put toe some, and not to others. 
ERSKINE 7386 If any individual reported a paper, made an observation, or made an argument, you took down just an abstract of that, in your own language 
LYNAM 7387 I did. 
ERSKINE 7388 vere they taken down, bond fide to be rePorted as a delegate, or were they they taken down for the purpose for which we have had them here
LYNAM 7389 They were taken down for the purpose of reporting as a delegate, and for the other purpose too. 
ERSKINE 7390 Then it was perfectly bone fide, with regard to the society, and, ut the same time, lone fide with regard to the public
LYNAM 7391 Just so. 
ERSKINE 7392 Have you made any alteration in your minutes since the time you made them 
LYNAM 7393 I have not; but I was going to say this, there are some private memorandums that are in this book, which do not belong to the society; those private inemorandums are wrote at the back of the society’s minutes; those are such as, I think, it would be very impropor for me to deliver up, and therefore I wish to know what I am to do in that case. 
ERSKINE 7394 Cannot you paste something over them 
LYNAM 7395 I could do it, if I were allowed time. 
EYRE 7396 lIt is always usual, and very reasonable it is, when a witness speaks from memorandums, that the counsel should have an epee nity of looking at those memorandums, when he is cross-examining that witness. If there is any thing that you say, upon your oath, does not relate to that subject, but some other subject, to be sure it is impossible that it could be asked, that that should be seen; how to arrange that in a very long evidence, like this, is among the difficulties of so ex i a case as this is; we must struggle with it as well as we can; whenever you are at’ leisure to go through the subject with him, if he holds bis yarers in his hands, you can ask him, as to is minutes, if they could be separated by pasting over, or if, with safety, by obliterating those parts. 
LYNAM 7397 Could you obliterate those memorandums which concern other people, witha pen and ink 
EYRE 7398 I could. 
EYRE 7399 Have you any objection, Mr. Erskine, to his obliterating his other memorandums with ink, you a of him, upon oath, whether he has obli any of those articles to which he spoke, when he gave evidence? 
ERSKINE 7400 None. 
EYRE 7401 In a common case, it is the usual course, for the ceunsel to take the memorandums in-his hand, for the cross-examination, but, in this case, I do not see how it is possible to do this ; this is a history, an im tt and material history, to be sure, of the different branches of this society as it is formed into divisions, aime by commission of delegates for the whole; it has so happened, that here are the transactions both of the divisions, and of the delegates, that are now laid before the jury ; of courseit must run into great length; I cannot say into more length than its importance requires ; we are ready to do all that we can to assist yes, consistently with not obliging him to discover what does not relate to this cause. 
ERSKINE 7402 Am I to understand you (and this is the only em I shall put wD I see these minutes) do you mean to re-swear that what you have read to-day, as minutes taken at the time, are the same minotes which you would have, bona fide, taken as 3 delegate, had you not had this otber view which you have before described
EYRE 7403 I will swear that. ‘ 
ERSKINE 7404 And the other delegates were in the course of taking similar memorandums 
EYRE 7405 Yes. 
EYRE 7406 I understood him to say, that he did, in fact, make his reports from these minutes; if he did not make his report to the division from theseminutes, he must have had another set of notes, for he must have made some, from the nature of the thing; for they were to report to the division every thing that passed among the delegates, that did not come under the head of secrecy, on the next day of holding that division mecting ; therefore it must be from some materials; consequently, if he has dealt fairly with us, these are the minutes. 
ERSKINE 7407 I shall only desire to look at them in the morning ; perhaps I shall not put any questions. 
EYRE 7408 I should, if I were in his case, put the book into your hand, without any difficulty, stating the parts that do not relate to this cause; then he will take his minutes, and obliterate those parts that do not relate to this cause against tomorrow morning. 
EYRE 7409 Mr. Maclean called again. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7410 Did you find that paper any where? — Yes; I found it in the house of Mr. Adams. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7411 Extract of a Letter, dated Sheffield, 18th of October, 1792, signed, “ The Editor of the Patriot, addressed to Mr. Andrews, secretary to the Society of the Friends of Universal Peace, and the Rights of Man, at Stockport. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7412 “It only remains then for us, secing the great and innumerable difficulties we have to encounter, to cast about for the most likely and proper means and weapons by which to detend ourselves, and to forward and support such measures as it may be necessary to pursue; and on this head, my good sir, permit me to impress it on the minds of your society, that reason, imperial reason, must ever be our eneralissimo, or commander in chief; when Tay this, I beg leave to add, that art must be second in command ; by the word ‘ art,’ I do not mean craft or cunning, but that mode of application of our reason and arguments on different men, and on different occasions, which only a considerable degree of study, and practical knowledge also, of men and manners, can ever furnish us with, so as to make us proficients. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7413 “ Allow me then to observe to you, sir, that 1 perfectly coincide with you in opinion, with regard to the different societies appointing delegates to go into the different villages, and country places, for the purpose of informing their minds, and rousing them from the lethargy in which they seem plunged. I have already communicated the same idea to the London Constitutional and Corresponding Societies, and to those of Norwich and Manchester, and I hope it will soon be universally adopted by every one. But the grand object to. be attended to, on this head, is the chdice of men to be appointed; a neglect of this kind had iike to have had very awkward consequences in this neighbourhood, and, if not immediately checked, would have injured the cause of freedom very greatly; infinite care and circumspection will therefore be necessary on this head. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7414 “As I am on the subject, permit me to suggest to those members of your society, who may undertake this arduous, but honourable and praise-worthy task, that they cannot be too cautious in their mode of ceeding. The minds of men, for the wisest and best purposes, are formed by the great Creator as various and unlike each other as their faces, and their passions reign over each with the same uncertain and variegated swmyself and in the same manner that sir Robert Walpole (one of the elders and fathers of corruption) very justly observed, that every man has his price in the way of being hought; so we may fairly apply the same maxim to mankind in general, in the article of persuasion, and the dextrous method of bringing them from wrong opinions they may have formed, or prejudices they may have imbibed, by anattentive observation of their mtellectual faculties, and that leading passion of the sout which governs the main spring of their most material actions. For example, the generality of farmers in this county and Lancashire, are as ignorant as the brutes they ride to market, and so absorbed in the sordid idea of getting, that, provided they can keep up the prices of rain, cattle, &c. so as to answer their landlords, and pay their taxes, however enormous, they are too sluggish and indolent to thmk about reforms, or any thing of the kind, yet there is one string about their hearts, which, being skilfully touched, will make them dance to any time, and move to any measwre, This is the subject of tythes ; why does it touch them? Why sir? Because it is within the scope of their limited capacity. Ignorant as they are in other matters, they see and pungently feel the weight of this baneful and unjust devourer of all their improvements in agriculture and husbandry ; and I believe, did every tax operate in the same visible degree which this imposition does, I fear there would be an end to the idea of taxation being submitted to at all. Indeed, as taxes are laid on, at present, by those who do not represent us, the taxation is neither more nor less than a robbery; a submission to it, slavery. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7415 “But to return to my subject. In the same manner that a farmer may be roused by the mention of tythes, the shoe-makers may by the excessive dearness of leather, the innkeeper by the numerous and unnecessary standing army, and all by a temperate and dispassionate relation of the immense number of sinecure places, and useless offices, in which the corrupt and prostitute favourites, agents, and dependants of the rich and great, riot in the spoils and plunder wrested from the sweat of the brow, and continual labour of the body of the husbandman, the mechanic, the labourer, and the artificer. It is by no means a difficult matter to raise general indignation at the idea of so small a comparative number of useless, idle, and profligate drones, sucking and squandering away the honey potincd by such immense numbers of hard-toiling and industrious bees. If you (for I am certain you will be one of the most active of these-delegates) meet with men who have violent prejudices in favour of any abuse or party, never attack those prejudices directly, for that will only inflame and confirm them the more; pass them over fur the present, and engage their attention towards something else, in which they will listen with a less degrce of apprehension of being attacked in a favourite point; once gain their good apinion, and open their eyes to one evil, they will be more ready to hear you on others; till, at last, the favourite object by which their cyes were jaundiced, will appear in its true colours, and fall before your arguinents like all the rest. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7416 “ There is one thing above all others which requires to be particularly attended to, and that is, to endeavour to undcceive the mass -of people, with respect to those falsehoods which have been industriously propagated by the enemies to a reform, in order to blind, delude, and terrify all ranks of people: who are any way independent, or possessed of Property: One of these falschoods is, “ that the advocates of reform wish to introduce a “levelling scheme, or an equal partition of property,’ This alarms the farmers, and indeed all classes of men, who, by their industry, or other adventitious circumstances, are possessed of the goods of this world. So many vile ministerial prints as have propagated this doctrine, aided and assisted by the private representations, or rather misrepresentations, of the clergy, and other tools of overnment, and of privileged orders, have da very wonderful and baneful effect on the multitude, and have stamped a dread of reform on the minds of many that I know, whose situations in life would induce one reasonably to suppose it impossible, so completely to impose upon them; however, it always has been the case, that falsehoods, boldly uttered, may prevail for a time, but must be overwhelmed, in the end, by the bright and sacred energies of truth. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7417 o explain this matter, and many others properly, will require great coolncss, moderation, and patience. I have found the tollowing method answer best: ‘ Do you know “such a gentleman?’ naming sume one of large property and good character in the neighbourhood, who is known to be a friend to a reform; ‘ Yes.’—‘ Well, and do you suppose that he would promote a scheme that would occasion and oblige him to part with property he possesses, in order for it to be di
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7418 ‘ vided amongst strangers whom he never saw or heard of ?’ ‘No’—“ Why then should you suffer yourself to be imposed on by such aa idle tale fabricated and calculated for the purpose of raising a dread in you against “those more enlightened of your fellow-citi“zens who wish for a reform, as yeu would, “did you see its necessity; a dread which “may cause you to shut your eyes upon op‘ pressive excise and game-laws, exorbitant tythes, an unnecessary standing army, kept on foot at the expense of two millions and a half, for the purposes of influence and cor‘ruption; .a pension-list, which is a disgrace to the government, and a stigma and re‘proach on the spirit and prudence of the “nation ; sinecure places, for the mere pos“sessing of which, hundreds of individuals receive thousands a year each, for duing nothing at all, either for the public service or their own; in short, such an enormous accumulation of taxes, and so prodigal an expenditure of their produce, as no nation on the earth ever heard of or submitted to before. To make you shut your eves, and continue blind to these enormities, those idle and futile tales are villanously dispersed “abroad ; but believe them not, consult your own reason, and it will show you that there is a palpable lie on the face of every one of them?’ Then explain the nature, aim, and end of your society, mvite them to attend it, and to judge for themselves: If they do so, they will soon aid and assist you, by adopting similar ones in their several neighbourhoods, till, in time, they will overspread the whole surface of this sca-girt isle. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7419 “ At present, sir, I will not trouble you further on the subject, which 1 now quit tw return to the conduct and regulatian of your own society, and all others which may arise hereafter; and as to them, I think the inakeepers in Stockport, Manchester, &c. have given you a hint and lesson, for which you ouglit to esteem yourselves for ever obliged to them. I own their insolence and audacity in proceeding as they have done, is beyond example, but only deserying of contempt; as such, leave them to themselves ; public-houses were never worthy of receiving such guests, whose sacred and important duty require and demand to be performed in mansions more dignified and respectable; your meetings should be at the houses of one -another in honourable rotatien ; and, to pree. vent inconvenience frum too great a number, not more than ten or twelve at the most should compose a primary or district meeting; more members may be admitted in each district, till they reach twenty or twenty-four according to the number fixed on—but thea immediately should divide into two district: meetings; the several districts should send each one member, by election, to a meeting of delegates, and this meeting of delegates should elect out of their own body a certain nuigber, which is to compose 3 select com: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7420 mittee ; this select committee to manage the correspondence, and every other important concern for the whole of the districts in any town or parish, subject always to the revision and approbation of the districts; the delegates and select committee to be chosen only for a limited time, before the expiration of which, others to be elected as betore, from the districts, to supply their places, by which rotations every member would in time become qualified to be a delegate and a select commnittce-man, though he might not be soon his first entrance as a district member. These are only hints on which you may improve or enlarge as much as you please. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7421 We will now read a draft of an answer to this letter, which was found likewise in the possession of Mr. Adams; it has nodate; it has two handwritings init; I may, perhaps, trouble your lordships, in the course of this cause, with evidence to prove whose hand-writings they are, but that is not necessary to enable me to read it; 1 wish todraw your lordships attention particularly to the two last paragraphs. 
MACLEAN 7422  found this paper at Mr. Adams’s house. 
MACLEAN 7423 “Gentlemen, The Society for Constitutional Information have been favoured with two letters bearing the signature of the editors ofthe Patriot. The first of these letters, dated June 11th, related particulars concerning the publication called the Patriot, accompanied by some of the first numbers. It required our opinion, and our public approbation of the work, with hints for its continuance. It likewise narrated several interesting particulars, relative to the friends and foes of liberty, their various habits and propensities, and added conjectures on the means by which those habits and propensities might be turned to theadvantage of freedom. 
MACLEAN 7424 “ The second letter, dated October 15, consisted of a complaint of neglect on the part of our society, a farther statement of facts simiJar to those contained in the first letter, and an account including letters of the proceed- ; ings of asocicty at Stockport. 
MACLEAN 7425 All these letters have been read by the society for Constitutional Information; and the manly spirit in which they were conceived, their honest zeal, and the love of free-dom by which their authors were animated, were highly grateful to chat society. It was no fecling of superiority, no intentional disreSpect, and assuredly no wilful mark of insult, at occasioned the silence of the society. We were required to perform that of which we were incapable ; to pass judgment on a publication which none of us had read, and to correspond with persons in the dark, who had not thought fit (for reasons which they no doubt held to be prudent) to trust us with their names, What could be due? We admired both the talents and the intention of our correspondents (or correspondent); but we are simple, honest men, wanting the priestly gift of intuition, and could not predicate good or ill of that, of which, not having’ read, we could have no knowledge. Several weeks passed away, and still the members could give no opinion of the Patriot ; for men. must individually act by their own judgments ; itis the very essence of freedom that they should be lett thus to act; they will read the book first that happens most to attract their’ notice ; and you, gentlemen, are too liberal, too just and too manly, to require them to approve what they had not read, however deserving they might suspect it to be of appro-bation. Of the purport, however, of your un-, dertaking, the ardour with which it is conceived, and the perseverance with which it, appears to be pursued, the socicty finds no hesitation in both approving and applauding most zealously. F “ You candidly ask the society for hints ; but the detail of your letters convinces us you are yourselves proficients. Honest men, however, advise, asked or not asked, whenever they imagine that by advising they can do: good. Perhaps, gentlemen, you may have read and one a publication, by the late father of his country, Dr. Franklin, called poor Robin's almanack ; in which, with characteristic simplicity of language, he descended to the feelings, wants and understandings of the lower order, and, in proverbial, jocular' wisdom, conveyed truths to them of the highest: importance, truths that prepared them for the subline efforts to which they were soun to be‘ roused; truths that led them onward to the avenuesof treedom, while their sight was too feeble to endure the splendor of the temple itself. A certain number of such proverbial axioms, which men of your genius wouldeasily invent, arranged at the beginning or end of each of your publications, and appeal- ing to the real wants, grievances, and affeotions of the people, of which you appear to be perfectly masters, could not fail of producing an effect. j “ We rejoice with you in the increase of the membersand societies of freedom : our bosoms glow with the same sentiments. Weare brothers in aflection, with you, with the freemen of Sheffield, of Stockport, and of the whole woild
EYRE 7426 Freedom, though an infant, makes herculean efforts ; and the vipers, aristocracy and monarchy, are panting and writhing under its grasp. May success, peace, and hap- piness attend those efforts. “ Permit us to add, that ‘the Society for Constitutional Information will gladly receive or communicate intelligences, and for that purpose be happy to correspond ‘either with other socicties or with individuals, that makethe great and common cause of an equal and real representation of the people in parlia-‘ ment, and the other grand objects of freedom, ; their end. Information on such: subjects, will, to this society, at all times, be peculiarly acceptable and gratifying. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7427 You are vey deaf, I believe; are not you? Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7428 To you know one Franklow 
EYRE 7429 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7430 Were you apprentice to him 
EYRE 7431 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7432 Where did he live
EYRE 7433 No. 1, China-walk, Lambeth. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7434 How long did you live with him 
EYRE 7435 I was bound apprentice in November last. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7436 How did your master use to employ himself after his work was over at night
EYRE 7437 He used to be out very late at nights. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7438 Was any thing going on up-sfairs in your master’s house 
EYRE 7439  Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7440 What 
EYRE 7441 Exercise. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7442 What sort of exercise 
EYRE 7443 Exercise with fire arms. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7444 Who came there to exercise with fire-arms
EYRE 7445 I did not know them all—I only knew two of them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7446 What are their names 
EYRE 7447 Mr. Shelmerdine and Mr. Williams. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7448 Williams the gun-maker, that lives at the Tower
EYRE 7449 Yes.

ATTORNEYGENERAL 7452 How often did they exercise there 
EYRE 7453 About twice a week. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7454 How many of them used to exercise there 
EYRE 7455 About eight at a time. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7456 Were they always the same eight or different people
EYRE 7457 I did not notice them always. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7458 Were there sometimes different people from those who came there at other times 
EYRE 7459 I suppose they were all the same. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7460 ’ Were the windows of the reom in which they exercised open or shut 
EYRE 7461 Shut, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7462 Were they shut accidently, or on purpose 
EYRE 7463 I do not know.

ERSKINE 7618  If this is worth pursuing, I would ask you whether you have one of these knives here
GREEN 7619 Yes; I have one in my pocket—Here it is producing it.] 
ERSKINE 7620 Is this all
GREEN 7621 Yes; I have had one of the kind seven years, and used it in my business. 
ERSKINE 7622 And you sometimes cut a bit of meat with it 
GREEN 7623 Yes, and cheese, or any thing. 
ERSKINE 7624 You had no intention to cut throats with it, I hope 
GREEN 7625 Never. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7626 How many of these knives have you now 
GREEN 7627 I have twenty left out of three dozen. 
ERSKINE 7628 Were those the same sort of knives that you said you had seen in various cutlers’ shops about town ?
GREEN 7629 Yes,. 
ERSKINE 7630 I think there is hardly a cutler’s shop in town that has not such knives
GREEN 7631 Very few that are any thing of a cutler’s shop. 
ERSKINE 7632 Are those knives any new discovery in the ingenious age in which we live, or have they been in use all your tims 
GREEN 7633 They are no new discovery ; I have used them seven years. 
ERSKINE 7634 I ask you, upon your solemn oath, whether there is any thing but what is common about these knives, or whether you did not use them in the common course of your trade, and whether Mr. Hardy did not buy them as a common customer 
GREEN 7635 Yes. 
ERSKINE 7636 And he happened to be taken up hefore you got them back again
GREEN 7637 Yes. 
ERSKINE 7638 It is a very useful knife; and I will buy one of them the next time I see you, Do you know Mr. Groves 
GREEN 7639 I do, 
ERSKINE 7640 Had you ever any conversation with Mr. Groves, about your having sold knives of that description 
GREEN 7641 He came to me to purchase 3 knite at my shop, among other things; he purchased several other articles at the same time; he remarked the utility of the knife; he said it was a very useful knife. ‘ 
ERSKINE 7642 Did you tell Groves that you had sold two or three hundred of them 
GREEN 7643 No. 
ERSKINE 7644 You swear that
GREEN 7645 I did not mention any particular number; I remember he madea remark in this kind of way, whether I had sold a number of these knives, whether it was a saleable article or no?—I said, yes.—No man in business would tell a person that it was not a saleable article; they would not purchase it, if he did. 
ERSKINE 7646 Did you tell him that you had sold two or three hundred, but desire him to speak low, because the parlour-door was open, and your wife was a damn’d aristocrat—did you say so
GREEN 7647 I will make oath that I did not make use of such an expression as that. 
EYRE 7648 What was the expression you did make use of
GREEN 7649 I do not know exactly what, but not such a one as that; no man has ever heard me swear an oath in that kind of way these seven years; I might make use of an expression in this kind of way, when he asked me if it wasa saleable article, and if I sold a uantity of them, I might say yes, it is a saleable article, or to that purpose, but I did not say that I had sold any particular number. 
ERSKINE 7650 Did you say any thing him as if there was any thing improper in selling the knives 
GREEN 7651 No. 
ERSKINE 7652 Did you desire him to speak low lest it should be heard by others, that you were selh ing acommon article in your shop
GREEN 7653 Not at 
ERSKINE 7654 You swear that
GREEN 7655 I do. 
ERSKINE 7656 I think it right to inform you, that Groves has thought fit to swear you told him to speak very low, for that your parlour-door was open, and your wife was a damn’d aristocrat, and that you did not want her to know that you you were selling these knives 
GREEN 7657 I swear I said ho such thing; these knives all lay open in my shop, so far from hiding them from my wife, or from any man in the parish, thatthey lay openly in the show-glass, and in the window for sale. 
ERSKINE 7658 Would you have sold a knife of any sort or description, to any man that you had the least idea was intended to be made use of illegally or unjustly 
GREEN 7659 Not if I knew it was intended to be made use of for that purpose. 
ERSKINE 7660 Did you bespeak these knives for the purpose of selling them to mischievous people, or in the ordinary course of your trade
GREEN 7661 In the ordinary course of my trade. 
ERSKINE 7662 ‘Then I understand you to swear positively, it is not true what Groves has sworn concer; 
ERSKINE 7663 ing you
GREEN 7664 What he has sworn I do not know, ‘but that Idid not make use of such an expression, I swear positively. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7665 To be sure, it is not a polite thing to call one’s wife a damn’d aristocrat, what did you “say about her
GREEN 7666 I do not recollect that I said a word of the kind, or throw out any such hint. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7667 Did you say any thing about your wife
GREEN 7668 I do not recollect, to the best of my knowledge, that I mentioned any thing about my wife. “Did you mention any t ing about aristocrat?—No, I do not know t at I said any thing about aristocrat, or my wife. 
ERSKINE 7669 Did you wish to conceal selling these knives from your wite
GREEN 7670 No. 
LAW 7671  Look at these papers—were they printed by you
GREEN 7672 I beg leave, with submission to the Court, to know, whether I am bound to aoswer that question ? 
EYRE 7673 lt depends upon what the nature of the paper is; you are not bound to answer any question that may tend to criminate yourself. 
LAW 7674 Certainly it is a paper of a seditious tendency—it was opened by Mr. Attorney General, as a description of the Ins and Outs, advising the people to provide themselves with arms. Without saying whether you published it, did you receive from any body, any application or any re uest to print a paper of those contents
GREEN 7675 I fo not ask you whether you did print it or not.—I had. 
LAW 7676 From whom
GREEN 7677 A person of the name of FPiodgson. 
LAW 7678 Where doos he live
GREEN 7679 I never was in his hhouse—I was informed he lived at Westminster. 
LAW 7680 ‘When were you applied to 
GREEN 7681 I presume it must be about the month of March last. 
LAW 7682 Hodgson has been already proved to bea member of the Corresponding Society. 
LAW 7683 [od Chief Justice Eyre.—What was it he brought to you, a printed paper, or a manuscript
GREEN 7684 A manuscript. 
LAW 7685 A manuscript copy of that paper which I have now shown you 
GREEN 7686 Yes. 
LAW 7687 The Ins tell us we arein dangerof invasion from the French. 
LAW 7688 he Outs tell us that we are in danger from the Hessians and Hanoverians. 
LAW 7689 Tn either case we should arm ourselves ; get arms, and Jearn how to use them. 
EYRE 7690 Can you fix the time when it was brought to you 
GREEN 7691 I presume about the month of March. 
EYRE 7692 Edward Hodson, —cross-examined by Mr. Gi ‘ 
EYRE 7693 ibbs. 
EYRE 7694 Were you a member of either of these societies
GREEN 7695 A member of the London Corresponding Society. 
EYRE 7696 How long have you been a member of it
GREEN 7697 I presume I was a member about three months—then I ceased to be a member. 
EYRE 7698 When did you cease to be amember 
GREEN 7699 Immediately upon the report that the society had improper objects in view. 
EYRE 7700 ‘At what time was that 
GREEN 7701 About the month of April, on the first apprehension, I believe, of the prisoner and Mr. Adams; I never went to the society afterwards. 
EYRE 7702 Have you any reason to think, during the time you were a member of the society, that they had any other objects but a parliamentary reform 
GREEN 7703 Never. 
EYRE 7704 You never had 
GREEN 7705 Never. 
EYRE 7706 In what House of Parliament 
GREEN 7707 In the Commons House of Parliament. 
EYRE 7708 Had you any idea that it was any part of their plan to attack the king 
GREEN 7709 Far from it. 
EYRE 7710 In any sd seh lessen his authority in the state
GREEN 7711 Far from it; I never heard any thing of the kind started directly nor indirectly. Had you any reason to suspect that they meant to displace the Lords from any authority they possess in the state ?—None at all ; I am sure I should not have continued with them a moment longer if I had. 
EYRE 7712 Did you cease to be a member of the society from any thing that you observed yourself, or was it from Mr. Hardy and Mr. Adams being taken up
GREEN 7713 Intirely from Hardy and Adams being taken ups and the reports in circulation, that, under the pretence of a reform, they were pursuing other objects. 
EYRE 7714 Did you attend the society often
GREEN 7715 No; I did not by any means, for my business would not admit of it, and a part of the three months that I was a member I was indisposed and confined to my room. 
EYRE 7716 However, during the whole time you did attend it, this was what you collected to be their object 
GREEN 7717 Exactly. 
EYRE 7718 They have been ta king of a convention ; had you any idea in the society, or did you hear from any of the society, that that convention was to take upon itself the function of legislature, was to make laws 
GREEN 7719 At the time 1 was in the society, I always understood when they were talking of aconvention, as a thing by no means determined on; that they wished to take the sense of different societies in the country, whether such a measure was adviseable, the assembling a convention. 
EYRE 7720 But had you any idea that any body of men were to be called together, who were to take from King, Lords, and Commons, the power of making laws, and were themselves to make laws for them
GREEN 7721 Oh—by no means, there was not the least shadow to form such an opinion from. 
EYRE 7722 Did you ever hear any conversation from any ofthe members, tending that way 
GREEN 7723 Never in my life. 
EYRE 7724 Had you any idea from any thing you ever heard, that there was an intention in this, or any of these societies, to introduce the anarchy of France into England 
GREEN 7725 No. 
EYRE 7726 You had not 
GREEN 7727 No; I had not. 
EYRE 7728 When was this hand-bill brought to you 
GREEN 7729 I believe in the month of March or April; I am not accurate as to the time; it must be about that time, for I did not become a member of the society till the month of February, I believe. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7730 You did not know what passed at the Globe tavern then 
HODSON 7731 No. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7732 All you know is, what passed between the month of February and the time of the apprehension of Hardy and Adams 
HODSON 7733 That is all 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7734 Then you chose to protect your own character, hearing of those reports, by remaining no longer in the society? your knowledge is only since the meeting at the Globe-tavern 
HODSON 7735 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7736 You were at Chalk-farm
HODSON 7737 I was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7738 Did you ever read the resolutions that passed at Chalk-farm
HODSON 7739 I have read them in the Teport. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7740 You had read them before you saw them in the report
HODSON 7741 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7742 Where
HODSON 7743 I had seen them in the printed account of the proceedings at Chalk-farm. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7744 Had you seen the printed account of the proceedings on the 20th of January 
HODSON 7745 I had not; I do not recolJect that I have read them to this hour. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7746 Did you know that they had had any thing todo with Mr. Paine’s works, he Rights of Man
HODSON 7747  I never knew that but by hearsay. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7748 “Were you applied to to print the proceedings at Chalk-farm? Ido not ask you whether you printed them
HODSON 7749 I was applied to. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7750 By whom
HODSON 7751 By several of the members, not by an individual member ; I was at the division, the committee division, as it was termed, and it being determined to priut them, I was applied to. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7752 My lords, I am Now going to prove, that the circular letter of Mr. Hardy, which your lordships heard read, telative to the calling a convention, was sent to Edinburgh and Strathaven; that it was answered from Strathaven by a letter ; I shall also prove the transactions which passed respecting it at Edinburgh, and having proved those cxciiisatices, 1 shall then state the grounds upon which I Bpecetend it will be open to me to prove other transactions in Scotland.

GARROW 7799 Name some other places to which you sent this letter 
ROSS 7800 I sent one to Strathaven. 
GARROW 7801 Any other
ROSS 7802 I think I sent one to Paisley, and to some other towns in the country. 
GARROW 7803 Did you send any to Dundee
ROSS 7804 I am not certain whether I did or not. 
GARROW 7805 ‘ou told me you attended several meetings of the British Convention, as it was called ; be so good as tell us any of the preening: of the British Convention, at which you were resent; had you any icular cause of owledge? did you write any of the minutes of the meeting
ROSS 7806 I took some of the minutes of the meeting of the convention. 
GARROW 7807 Did you act as secretary of the convention, upon those occasions 
ROSS 7808 Now and then; sometimes I did. 
GARROW 7809 Without troubling you with the whole of the proceedings which we have had already; do you remember any particular resolution, which was with any extraordinary solemnity, at the convention 
ROSS 7810 I do not recollect particularly; I would know them to be parts of the minutes of the convention that I wrote myself, if I saw them. 
GARROW 7811 Ifin the minutes of the convention, you should see itin your own band-writing, you would know it again ; but what I am speaking of, is not there; was there any resolution passed with extraordinary solemnity, such as ising up and taking one another by the hand, or any thing of that kind 
ROSS 7812 I recollect something of that kind having happened, but I do not face what it was. 
EYRE 7813 Were you there when it happened 
ROSS 7814 I am not very certain whether I was or not, but I recollect being questioned upon that very circumstance upon the trials at Edinburgh, but I cannot be positive at present upon the circumstances what it was. 
EYRE 7815 Were you present at any time when any resolution was passed with extraordinary solemnity, such as extending the hand (the mode of swearing I believe in Scotland), or by taking one another by the hand. Do you recollect such a circumstance, with respect to any resolution 
ROSS 7816 ] do not recollect it. 
EYRE 7817 Do you recollect the dispersion of the British Convention, by the magistracy of the country 
ROSS 7818 I was not present at the frst dispersion ; I was in custody then. 
EYRE 7819 Do you remember the fact of the dispersion of the convention 
ROSS 7820 Yes. 
EYRE 7821 After that do you know of forming any committees of ways and means, or any thing of that sort
ROSS 7822 After the dispersion of the convention, I did not act in the societies myself, but I understood
EYRE 7823 I do not ask you what you understood
ROSS 7824  Then I do not know. 
EYRE 7825 Do you know of the formation of any committee of union, which met in your own house 
ROSS 7826 I cannot swear positively ; it became the common talk, but Twas not present at one, and was not privy to their proceedings. 
EYRE 7827 Though you were not yourself present at any of their meetings, did you from any of the persons who were members of the British Convention before its dispersion, learn that there had been a committee of union formed; did you learn that after the dispersion of the convention from any of the members of the convention 
ROSS 7828 I understood there was a committee. 
EYRE 7829 Did you understand that from any of the members of the convention which had been dispersed 
ROSS 7830 I cannot be certain to that, but I understood there was a committee. 
GARROW 7831 My lords, we will now read this letter which this witness says he received from Stock ; we have produced a large bundle of these circular letters to country correspondents, which were found in the possession of the prisoner. 
GARROW 7832 This letter was transmitted by the witness to Miller, at Perth, and he says he sent other copies to different places in the country, particularly to Strathaven ; your lordships recols lect that an answer to that sent to Strathaven, has been read. 
GARROW 7833 “ Citizens, The critical moment is arrived, and Britons must either assert with zeal and firmness their claims to liberty, or yield without resistance to the chains that ministerial usurpation is forging for them. Will you coOperate with us, in the only peaceable measure that now presents itself with any prospect of success? We need not intimate to you, that notwithstanding the unparalleled audacity of a corrupt and overbearing faction, which at present tramples on the rights and liberties of the people, our meetings cannot in England be interrupted, without the previous adoption of a convention bill—a measure it is our duty to anticipate, that the ties of union may be more firmly drawn, and the sentiments and views of the different societies throughout the nation be compared, while it is yet In our power, so as to guide and direct the future operations of the friends of freedom. Rouse then, to one exertion more ! and let us show our consciousness of this important truth, “Ifwe are to be beaten down with threats, prosecutions, and illegal sentences, we are unworthy, we are incapable of liberty..—We must, however, be expeditious. Hessians and Austrians are already among us; and if wc tamely submit, a cloud of these armed barbarians may shortly be poured in upon us. Let us form then another British Convention; we have a central situation in our view, which, we believe, would be most convenient for the whole island ; but which we forbear to mention (entreating your confidence in this particular) till we have the answer of the societics any ofthe members, tending that way 
ROSS 7834 Never in my life. 
GARROW 7835 Had you any idea from any thing you ever heard, ihat there was an intention in this, or any of these societies, to introduce the anarchy of France into England 
ROSS 7836 No. 
GARROW 7837 You had not 
ROSS 7838 No ; I had not. 
GARROW 7839 When was this hand-bill brought to you 
ROSS 7840 I believe in the month of March or April; I am not accurate as to the time; it must be about that time, for I did not become a member of the society till the month of February, I believe. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7841 You did not know what passed at the Globe -tavern then 
HODSON 7842 No. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7843 All you know is, what passed between the month of February and the time of the apprehension of Hardy and Adams 
HODSON 7844 That is all. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7845 Then you chose to protect your own character, hearing of those reports, by remaining no longer in the society? your knowledge 1only since the meeting at the Globe-tavern
HODSON 7846 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7847 You were at Chalk-farm
HODSON 7848 I was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7849 Did you ever read the resolutions that passed at Chalk- farm 
HODSON 7850 I have read them in the sie ou had read them before you saw them in the report?—Yes. Where?—I had seen them in the printc:| account of the proceedings at Chalk-farm. Had you seen the printed account of the proceedings on the 20th of January ?—I had not; I do not recollect that I have read thei to this hour. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7851 Did you know that they had had any ti. todo with Mr. Paine’s works, he ti of Man? I never knew that but by say. Were you applied to to print the pr:

Upon your oath, were not you present when that resolution was come to
HODSON 7879 I think I was. 
GARROW 7880 Attend to this---“ The convention doth hereby resolve, that each delegate, immediately on his return home, do convene his constituents, and explain to them the necessity of electing a delegate, or delegates, and of ssiahliacing a fund, without delay, against any of these emergencies, for his or their expense; and that they do instruct the said delegate or delegates, to hold themselves ready to depart at one hour's warning. Now I fancyIhave brought you to recollect this
HODSON 7881 I du recollect that Ban your reading it. 
GARROW 7882 Now attend, No persons were members of this society but persons of moral life and conversation; respectable, orderly, and decent citizens, I think you told that gentleman
HODSON 7883 I hat was not my answer to the question ; he asked me if there were not reputable trudesmen belonging to that society ?—I said, yes. 
GARROW 7884 So you understood. that question to be, whether there were not some reputable tradesmen belonging to that society
HODSON 7885 Yes. 
GARROW 7886 Was Watt a member of that society 
HODSON 7887 No. 
GARROW 7888 Was Downie t
HODSON 7889 He was. 
GARROW 7890 As you have told that gentleman, upon your cross-examination, that you took the intention to be to proceed by peace and order: 
GIBBS 7891 I submit to your lordship that that is improper. That sort of interlarding a a question is not permitted to us even in crossexamination. 
EYRE 7892 I perfectly agree with you. It is an habitual irregularity; I state that as a common excuse for it all, asa thing to be corrected as much as wecan. I did not expect we should get right in a moment; let us keep as much within bounds as we can; it disturbs the argument of the examination entirely, when it is so filled with these observations. 
GARROW 7893 I am much obliged to your lordship for the kindness with which the admonition comes, and for my part, I will endeavour to submit myself immediately to it.— Were you there when it was resolved, “ That the moment of any illegal dispersion of the present convention, shall be considered asa summons to the delegates to repair to the place of meeting appointed for the convention of emergency, by the secret committee : and that the secret committee be instructed to proceed, without delay, to fix the place of meeting
HODSON 7894 I think I was present at that meeting. 
ERSKINE 7895 It is stated that the moment with which we are in correspondence. Let us have your answer then by the 20th, at farthest, earlier if possible, whether you approve of the measure ; and how many delegates you can send, with the number also, if possible, of your societies. We remain your's, in civic affection, the London Corresponding Society, T. Harpy, secretary. 
ERSKINE 7896 “ For the management of this business we have appointed a secret committee. You will judge, how far it is necessary for you todo the same. 
ERSKINE 7897 Addressed on the back Mr. Walter Miller, merchant, Perth. 
ERSKINE 7898 “ Show this to your neighbours. 
ERSKINE 7899 “ Answer, post paid, to the care of George Ross, Liberty Court, Edinburgh. Thegazetteer is tocomce out immediately. 
ERSKINE 7900 “Nothing but ready money subscriptions received. 
ERSKINE 7901  What was the object of your society, the 
ERSKINE 7902 Friends of the People
HODSON 7903 To procure a reform in parliament; a reform in the House of Commons. Did your objects extend farther than to a reform in the House of Commons ?—It was only the House of Commons that I associated to reform. 
ERSKINE 7904 Had your society any design, from what you collected from the members of it, and from what was said and done in your presence, to attack the king’s person, or his prerogative, or state 
HODSON 7905 I never thought so. 
ERSKINE 7906 Was it your object in that association to do so
HODSON 7907 My object was to procure a reform in the House of Commons. 
ERSKINE 7908 You I think were made a delegate from your society to the British Convention 
HODSON 7909 Yes. 
ERSKINE 7910 When you met together, the delegates from the different societies in your convention, did you consider yourselves as the parliament of Great-Britain 
HODSON 7911 No not at all. We meant to consider the proper means of petitioning parliament. 
ERSKINE 7912 Was any thing done, or said, by the delegates, situng in the convention, as if they had assumed to themselves the authority and functions of magistracy
HODSON 7913 I could conceive no such thing. 
ERSKINE 7914 Did they exercise any functions of legislative, or executive power 
HODSON 7915 No such thing. 
ERSKINE 7916 Was there any thing said by any members against the king 
HODSON 7917 Not that 1 know of; not that I heard. 
ERSKINE 7918 Did you make any laws to bind the people?? We should have been very foolish if we had proposed such a thing. 
ERSKINE 7919 What appeared to you to be the object 
HODSON 7920 To procure a reform in the Commons House of Parliament. 
ERSKINE 7921 How were you to do it 
HODSON 7922 By a petition. 
ERSKINE 7923 Was that said aniong the members of the convention 
HODSON 7924 Yes ; and several petitions were sent previous to the meeting of the British Convention. 
ERSKINE 7925 What number did the British Convention consist of 
HODSON 7926 About two hundred. 
ERSKINE 7927 Had you provided yourselves with arms to attack the magistracy and government of the country 
HODSON 7928 We had not. 
ERSKINE 7929 Were the delegates prepared to resist the magistracy by force 
HODSON 7930 Not at all; when the magistrates came to disperse the British Convention the second day, they did not resist them when the sheriff showed his authority ; he took the chairman by his hand and tock him out of the chair; he said he was doing nothing illegal, gnd would not leave the chair ull the sheriff took him forcibly out. 
ERSKINE 7931 If you had considered that you were duing that which was illegal and dishonourable for a subject to do, should you have done it !— No; we should have refrained from it. 
ERSKINE 7932 Should you have done it if you had thought it likely to be dangerous to the king's government or person 
HODSON 7933 No; I never meant any such thing, I had no such intention. 
ERSKINE 7934 Do you think there were any other persons in your society who meant any such thing 
HODSON 7935 I never did; for it was always understucd, that our society was to obtain a reform ia parliament. ’ 
ERSKINE 7936 What sort of persons did the convention consist of 
HODSON 7937 There were people of all ranks belonging to the societies, most of the poor class of people. Were there any reputable tradesmen belonging to it?—Yes; there were some very reputable gentlemen among them. 
ERSKINE 7938 People of good character, sober lives, and morals 
HODSON 7939 Most of them were men of sober lives and morals. 
ERSKINE 7940 Was there any proposition made in the convention, in your presence, during the time you attended it, that led to assuming any authority of your own
HODSON 7941 No; we never thought of any such thing. 
GARROW 7942 It would not have occurred to me to ask you, whether you were a traitor, or your associates declared themselves to be so.—Now I will put some questions to you, upon what you have been asked. You have told that gentleman that you had no idea of assuming the powers of legislation by force 
ROSS 7943 No ideas of that at all. 
GARROW 7944 You meant merely to procure, or obtain, if you could, a reform in the representation of the people 
ROSS 7945 You are very right. 
GARROW 7946 And that by peaceable means 
ROSS 7947 Yes. 
GARROW 7948 And that you would have shuddered at an idea of force, or resistance to the civil power of the country ; dol take you right
ROSS 7949 Yes ; very right. 
GARROW 7950 You had no idea of going farther than a fair, peaceable, and orderly application for a redress of that which you conceived to be wrong 
ROSS 7951 I will answer for: myself; I had not. 
GARROW 7952 Were you present when that convention came to this resolution ? and then the proper constitutional judges will say, whether you meant it or not : 
GARROW 7953 hat this convention, considering the calamitous consequences of any act of the legislature which may tend to deprive the whole, or any part of the people, of their undoubted right to meet, either by themselves, or by delegation, to discuss any matter relative to their common interest, whether of a public or private nature, and holding the same to be totally inconsistent with the first principles and safety of society, and also subversive of our known and acknowledged constitutional liberties, do hereby declare, before God and the world, that we shall follow the wholesome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which shall militate against the constitution of our country, and shall continue to assemble and consider of the best means by which we can accomplish a real representation of the people, and annual election, until compelled to desist by superior force.’—Did you know that the convention, of which you were a member, ‘who sought all those things by peaceful and orderly means, had come to that resolution 
ROSS 7954 I am not certain whether ever that resolution was passed in the convention. 
GARROW 7955 Upon your oath, were not you present when it was proposed
ROSS 7956 I do not recollect that it was proposed. 
GARROW 7957 Will you swear you were not present 
ROSS 7958 I cannot be certain, because the convention met for several weeks, I believe; andI cannot be certain whether I was present, if that was passed at it, or no. 
GARROW 7959 Can you say you were not present when such a resolution was passed
ROSS 7960 I cannot answer positively to the question, on account of the convention meeting for two or three weeks, and I could not get to attend it every day for all the time that the committee met, but I commonly attended two or three hours of every day. I cannot recollect all the difterent motions that were moved and passed in the convention, whether I was present at them or not. 
GARROW 7961 Attend to this “ The convention doth hereby resolve, that each delegate, immediately on his return home, do convene his constituents, and explain to them the necessity of Beene a delegate, or deletes, and of establishing a fund, without lelay, against any of these emergencies, for his or their expense; and that they do instruct the said delegate or delegates, to hold themselves ready to depart at one hour's warning. Now I fancy Ihave brought you to recollect this
ROSS 7962 I dv recollect that from your reading it. 
GARROW 7963 Now attend, No persons were members of this society but persons of moral life and con versation ; respectable, orderly, and decent citizens, I think you told that gentleman
ROSS 7964 I hat was not my answer to the question ; he asked me if there were not reputable tradesmen belonging to that society ?—I said, yes. 
GARROW 7965 So you understood that question to be, whether there were not some reputable tradesmen belonging to that society
ROSS 7966 Yes. 
GARROW 7967 Was Watt a member of that society
ROSS 7968 No. 
GARROW 7969 Was Downie t
ROSS 7970 He was. 
GARROW 7971 As you have told that gentleman, upon your cross-examination, that you took the Intention to be to proceed by peace and order: 
GIBBS 7972 I submit to your lordship that that is improper. That sort of interlarding a a question is not permitted to us even in crossexamination. 
EYRE 7973 I perfectly agree with you. It is an habitual irregularity; statc that as a common excuse for it all, as a thing to be corrected as much as wecan. I did not expect we should get right in a moment; let us keep as much witbin bounds as we can; it disturbs the argument of the examination entirely, when it is so filled with these observations. 
GARROW 7974 I am much obliged to your lordship for the kindness with which the admonition comes, and for my part, I will endeavour to submit myself immediately to it.— Were you there when it was resolved, “ That the moment of any illegal dispersion of the present convention, shall be considered asa summons to the delegates to repair to the place of meeting appointed for the convention of emergency, by the secret committee : and that the secret committee be instructed to proceed, without delay, to fix the place of meeting 
ROSS 7975 I think I was present at that meeting. 
ERSKINE 7976 It is stated that the moment any of those things were communicated, they were to be a signal for your holding a convention at such a place 
ROSS 7977 Yes. 
ERSKINE 7978 But what were you todo when you got together in this convention 
ROSS 7979 To petition parNiament to get those grievances redressed. 
GARROW 7980 That gentleman has asked you, what you were to do when you should be got together upon the summons of the delegates. Do you mean to state, upon your oath, that you had the least apprehen- , 
GARROW 7981 sion that that meeting, in a Convention of Emergency, summoned by a secret committee of emergency, was for the purpose of again petitioning parliament 
ROSS 7982 I would never have agreed tu the motion upon any other terms. 
GARROW 7983 Do you mean to state, upon your oath, that ou understood that the resolution which I ve read to you, and which I will read again —“ That we shall follow the wholesome examp!c of former times, by paying no regard to any act which shall militate against the constitution of our country, and shall continue to assemble and consider of the best means by which we can accomplish a real representation of the people, and annual election, until compelled to desist by superior force. — Do you mean to swear that you understood that to be to meet in such convention for the pas of again petitioning parliament
ROSS 7984 I ad no other idea. 
GARROW 7985 Do you mean to state, that you understood that to be the meaning of such a meeting in a Convention of Emergency
ROSS 7986 I understood it to be that some people should be authorized to call a meeting whenever any of those circumstances should take place, and the in tention of the meeting would be that of petitioning parliament. 
GARROW 7987 That the delegates were to hold themselves in readiness to depart at an hour’s warning, for the purpose of again petitioning that parliament, which they had already petitioned without success ? 
GIBBS 7988 The convention never had petitioned parliament. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7989 It has been distinctly proved in evidence, that these Scotch societies had stated that more effectual means should be used. 
GIBBS 7990  Mr. Garrow states that the object was to petition again that parliament which the convention had before petitioned without effect—Now I am not aware that the convention had petitioned parliament. 
EYRE 7991 It is not a subject to be debated, but it is perfectly clear that just in the manner in which the question was put, the fact was not stated. 
GARROW 7992 Do you mean to represent to the Court and the Jury, that you understood that the delegates were to hold themselves in readiness to assemble upon an hour’s Notice, in order to petition parliament upon the dispersion of the convention 
ROSS 7993 I understood that the delegates, whenever they got information that a convention was necessary to be held, that they should immediately repair to a place appointed. 
GARROW 7994 Do you mean again to state that you un derstood the purpose of that second convention, after the dispersion of the first, was to petition parliament
ROSS 7995 That is what I mean. 
GARROW 7996 Let me see whether I understand you distinctly, for God forbid E should misunderstand you, or endeavour to misrepresent you—You 
GARROW 7997 ‘ understood that the convention of emergency, which was to be collected by the committee of emergency upon an hour's notice, was tr petition parliament 
ROSS 7998 I never would have agreed to the meeting of any convention, if they meant to oppose parliament; and I understood that if there was a convention called again, that they certainly would petition parliament for redressing the supposed grievances which existed. 
GARROW 7999 For what purpose, after the dispersion of the existing convention, was a new convention of emergency to be called by a committee of emergency, to petition parliament, as you understood it 
ROSS 8000 I understood they would petition parliament, that although their petiton was rejected, they would still continue, they would not throw aside the notion of a parlismentary reform merely from the rejection of a petition or two, 
GARROW 8001 So that though the first petition should be rejected, and the convention dispersed by force, yet you understood there was to bea committee of emergency. to call a new convention of emergency, and so & on i petitioning, though they should have ther petitions again rejected (—I understood that the Friends of the People meant to petition parliament till they should gain their end. 
GARROW 8002 Then why did not the society of the Friends of the People go on petitioning perliament, without sending delegates to a British Convention for the purpose of effecting these reforms 
ROSS 8003 One of the Teasons for that was, it was noticed thata petition for parliamentary reform did not specify any particular reform, and that was one of the reasons for a convention as I understood if, to specify the particular reform in their petitions that they wanted, and likewise. 
GARROW 8004 And likewise what
ROSS 8005 I do not recollect what I was going to say. 
GARROW 8006 Where is your place of residence 
ROSS 8007 At the Water of Leith. Were you a delegate at the British Convention, which assembled at Edinburgh ?—Yes. 
GARROW 8008 Did you attend the meetings of that convention 
ROSS 8009 Sometimes. 
GARROW 8010 Were there any committees for the purpose of managing the business of this convention 
ROSS 8011 I believe there were. 
GARROW 8012 Are you now sworn according to the manmer in which you usually take an oath
ROSS 8013 No. 
GARROW 8014 You were a delegate of the British Convention assembled at Edinburgh 
ROSS 8015 Yes. 
GARROW 8016 Were there any committees of the convention for the purpose of managing its business 
ROSS 8017 I believe there were. 
GARROW 8018 Did they from time to time report to the convention itself
ROSS 8019  As to that Ido not remember. 
GARROW 8020 Do you remember the circumstance of the convention being dispersed by the magistrates 
ROSS 8021 Yes. 
GARROW 8022 After the convention was dispersed, do you semember any committec being formed out of the societies 
ROSS 8023 Yes. 
GARROW 8024 What was the name of it
ROSS 8025 There was a large coramittee assembled, as I saw by handbills, that went under the name of the Comsnittee of Union. 
GARROW 8026 Of what persons was that Committee of Union composed 
ROSS 8027 I cannot mform you as to the names. 
GARROW 8028 Was it composed of members of the convention which had bcen dispersed 
ROSS 8029 Some of them were, I believe some were not, at least for aught I know. 
GARROW 8030 Were those who, as far as you know, were not members of the former convention, members of the Society of the Friends of the People at Edinburgh 
ROSS 8031 I cannot say that, becquse I was not formerly acquainted with them. 
GARROW 8032 Was there any other committee, called a Committee of Ways and Means 
ROSS 8033 There was another committce chosen out of the large one, which went under the name of a Subcommittee, and after that it was styled in a inted paper a Committee of Ways and 
GARROW 8034 Ieans; but who made it out in that form I know not. 
GARROW 8035 Of that committee which was called the Committee of Ways and Means, who were the members
ROSS 8036 Mr. Stock, Mr. Bourke, Mr. Aitcheson, Mr. Bonthron, Mr. Downie, Mr. Watt, and myselfi 
GARROW 8037 Do you remember Watt, as a member of that Committee of Ways and Means, reading any plan for the purpose of effecting some mischief at Edinburgh 
ROSS 8038 Yes, I do. 
GARROW 8039 You had been a member of the British Convention
ROSS 8040 Yes. 
GARROW 8041 What was the plan which was read in she Committee of Ways and Means by Mr. Watt, one of the delegates, and who was a member of that committee 
ROSS 8042 The purport of what he read from the paper, as I think, can thus, that it was. 
GARROW 8043 Attend to me a single moment—do you know for what purpose, in particular, you were assembled at the time that this plan was 
GARROW 8044 — ee rend—was it for answering any letter 
ROSS 8045 Da you know for what purpose this sub-committee was chosen ?—The reason of choosing this sub-committee, as far as I cam understand it, was, to look into the circumstances of Mr. Skirving; for this reason, that a fortnight before there was a letter read that came from him by a man on that large committee, intimatiag that there was due to him, from the Friends of the People, twenty pounds, atid he wished they would make good that payment to support his wife and family when he had left the land; that was what I conceived the committee was appuinted for. 
GARROW 8046 Ia that Committee of Ways and Means, was there any letter which had come to the society, or any of its members, which pure ported to be a circular letter which you were then met to answer? Leok athis letter, was this letter produced in the Committee of. Ways and Mecans
ROSS 8047 If it was, it was not in my presence, I never saw it. 
GARROW 8048 At a Committee of Ways and Means, Watt read a plan
ROSS 8049 Yes. 
ERSKINE 8050 Mr. Attorney General, wish to know im whet way you make this evidence? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8051 It is due from me to state to your lordships how I shape the case. We have now, as your lordships recollect, proved by a letter on the 17th of May, 1793, from Mr. Hardy, by a Mr. Urquhart, who was then going to Ediaburgh, that he sent this proposition to the Convention a Edinburgh, to associate not only that society with the London Corresponding Seciety, but both with every other society throughout the nation—that in answer to that, Mr. Skirving, who appears to be the secretary, in a lettor which was found in the possession of the prisoner states—“ If either you in England, or we in Scotland, should ateempt separately the reform which we seek to obtain, we should, by so doing, only expose our weakness, and manifest our ignorance of the corruption which opposes our important undertaking
ROSS 8052  If we sought only the extirpation of one set of nieces teil men frony the management of national affairs, that place might be given to another set, without affecting the vitals adverse to the system of reform.—It then states in general, that they must have the whole, and not a part—and then he desires that there might be a general union of the people themselves; he says—“ haste therefore, (addressing himself to the prisoner) “ to associate, at 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8053 Be 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8054 Teast to be ready to associate
ROSS 8055 If then such a j broken state of things should take place, the civil broils that would necessarily ensue, would soon subside: before the united, irresistible voice of the whole.—Do not, I entreat you, hesistate, thinking such a work premature as yet, but a month, and then it may be -too late—A malignant party may be already formed, and only waiting for the halting of the present managers ; it will then be too late to seck to subject to deliberation, after a party has dared the act of rebellion. ‘If you go no farther than separate Meetings in different towns, we will not be able to confide in your confraternity, because, while in such a state, you. may be but the tools of a faction—We could have all confidence, and unite with all affection in one assembly of commissfencrs from all countries of the world, if we knew they were chosen by the unbiassed voice of the people, because they would come up with the same disinterested views and desires as ourselves, having all agreed to a common centre of union and interest ; but we could not confide in fellow-citizens who kept aloof from -such union, and would not previously affiliate an one great and indivisible family. Upon the 23d of November, 1793, a letter was written to Norwich, by the prisoner, in which he informs the society at Norwich, “ of the convention'called and now sitting in Edinburgh, for the purpose of obtaining a speedy and radical reform in the system of parliamentary representation, and you are also in possession of the circumstances of our having sent two delegates, Margarot and Gerrald, to represent our increasing society in that respectable assembly. The Society for Constitutional Information has also elected twu representatives, Yorke and Sinclair, the datter only of whom has gone to Scotland for the discharge of his important mission. Then he states to the Norwich Society, that the object of the present letter was to inform them of the important communications which their mission had produced; that it had diffused spirit and resolution through the different societies in Scotland; that there must be a complete union for the recovery of their rights, and the complete renovation of the liberties and happiness which they are entitled to as men, and expect as Britons; that an increase of affection, zeal, and confidence—a concert of peemanent union—a free communication and comparison of sentiments and intentions, mature deliberation and mutual reliance, arethe fruits of the measures adopted by the friends of liberty in Scotland, and seconded by those in Lendon and Ireland. Then he presses the Society at Norwich to rouse to immediate co-operation with those efforts in Scotland, for the general good—he is desirous to awaken them toa sense of the importance of the object they were to pursue, nn to persuade all the societies in England to have an immediate junction with this federation.—And then he desires them to send a delegate of their own, in ordef that they may, by a general union, so step forward an avow their sentiments, as to ensure a speedy termis nation of the war, and a: restoration of every right'to which Britons and freemen are entitled. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8056 Your lordships will give me leave to put you in mind also, that this society wrote to Sheffield, to Leeds, and'I think to one or two other places, to send delegates to the convention in Scotland; they did send delegates to the convention in Scotland; and: Skirving, whose name has before occurred, aj pears to have written circular letters upon the arrival of the delegates of the two English societies, desiring all the societies to come 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8057 Your lordships likewise recollect, that we have given in evidence, letters that were written by Hardy, and also by peeet and Gerrald, who were delegates in Scotland ; and likewise letters written from those delegates to Hardy, whilst the convention was sitting. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8058 Hardy, in a letter of the 8th of November, 1793, says—“ That part of your letter which mentioned your visiting different towns in Scotland, for the purpose of promoting the cause; they were pleased with the idea, bat they thought that it could not be put in prac tice, on account of the necessary supplies, which come in but slowly
ROSS 8059 Your lordshi will also find that there was that solemn resolution made, which has before been men tioned; and from the proceedings of the s0ciety, it is clear. that they had even laid the plans of future conventions, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8060 Your lordships will also be pleased to recollect that, on the 8th of December, 1793, Mar. garot, who was then in Scotland, writes to the secretary of the London Corresponding Society, a letter—There is also a letter of the 22d of December, 1793, in which M: writes them, to come to very strong resol tions
ROSS 8061 There is another letter of the 24th of December, 1793, of Skirving to Hardy, p which he says—“ The time is now arriv that we must show ourselves worthy of liberty, or deservedly lose it; the opposition of our adversaries, is demonstration of the propriety and efficacy of the means which we have employed to obtain it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8062 Then upon the 20th of January, 1794, your lordship will also recollect, that at the Globe: tavern they came to precisely the same resolution, as that which was come to in the convention in Scotland, before that conven tion was dispersed
ROSS 8063 That upon any motion in the House of Commons, to prevent the eople meeting in societies for Constitutional Faeiaetion, 1 e convention should be called immediately; andyour lordships will also recollect, that that motien was communicated from Scotland (after the magistrates had ins terfered) by a letter which has been read— written, I think, by Margarot or Skirving,— in which they state that that resolution was come to, leaving out, “ in case of invasion."— And they state that letters will not safely communicate all they have to say upon the subject. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8064 After the dispersion of the convention, these societies no longer existed as a convention; but the Friends of the People, and other affiliated societiesin Scotland, proceeded to form committees of Ways and Means, and Union: —I have therefore, I submit, clearly laid a foundation to show that up to this period, all those societies were affiliated, that is the London and Scotch Societies; and that it is exceedingly clear, whatever convention was to called, was to be a convention bath of the people of England and Scotland. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8065 his being so we have-also laid before your lordships evidence, of which I will say this only, that it is evidence to go to the jury, that the aftiiated societies in London, many of the members ot them were providing themselves with muskets and pikes; that the Sheffield society, which corresponded as well with Scotland as with London, was also providing pikes :, then I conceive that I am at liberty to proveasatactin thiscase, the providing of pikes, agd the actual existence of nina of resistance to the government in Scotland at the same time, precisely upon the same principle as if we were now trying what would be a much more manifest overt act, I mean an open rebellion in the country—I conceive, upon the principle laid down in lord Lovat’s, and other cases, that there could not be a particle of doubt, that if I had charged an open act of rebellion in England, that I should have been entitled to show that in fact there was in Scotland, another armed force resisting the king's forces there; even though I did not show any communication by letter between them, so as to make it probable that they were co-operating with each other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8066 ‘I submit to your lordships, that this is evidence to go before the jury, leaving them to judge of the application that it has. 
ERSKINE 8067 We have been detained here for so many days, and we who are of counsel for the prisoner, having only been dismissed from the court to have that rest which nature requires, without any opportunity of Jonking at the different papers which constitute the great body of evidence in the cause, I confess, for one, that I am not so well prepared as I ought to be, nor is it possible for any man to be, to follow the attorney general in the connexion which he seems to iabour upon the different documents which he has read. As far as I understand him, I take it that there is nothing that can or ought to connect the prisoner with the proceedings in Scotland; in which he is sought to he involved
ROSS 8068 In the first place, the letter which the altorney general has sead from Skirving. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8069 In otder that I may state the thing entirely to the Court, I beg to put the Court in mind that we have ew proved that a circular letter which was zo call this convention, has been actually found in Scotland, and that that isa circular letter, which is written after resolutions which state that they are to have a convention of the people. ‘ 
ERSKINE 8070 I fares the attorney general considers it only as evidence of first branch. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8071 Yes. 
ERSKINE 8072 Then we will admit it. 
ERSKINE 8073 Mr. Garrow to McEwan
ROSS 8074 I believe we left off at that part of Watt's plan, that had stated a design of kindling a fire at the Ex-. cise- office in the new town’—Yes; that a fire was-to be kindled at the Excise-office, and a arty of men to be stationed at the Luckenths, a party at the head of the Westbooth, and the fire was to draw the military from the rrison. 
ERSKINE 8075 From the Castle at Edinburgh 
ROSS 8076 Yes. When they came down past the booth, the men that were stationed upon the head of the booth, according as his plan ran, they were to come in behind them, and the men, stationed at the Luckenbooths, were to take them in the front, and so inclose them between two parties; as far as I could understand the paper read to us, there were different partics, as was mentioned, who were to seize the different banking-houses in Edinburgh, and commissioners were to be appointed for to go and demand the cash from the banks: that is, as far as I recollect, the purport of that paper, which he read at that time. 
ERSKINE 8077 whom were those several parties, which were to be thus stationed, to be composed 
ROSS 8078 I do not know; I know not a single individual. 
ERSKINE 8079 What sort of persons, or belonging to what sort of societies or committees were they to be
ROSS 8080 What I thought upon by his plan wag that he meant it to be done by the Friends of the People ; but at the same time I did not know a single individual that was to engage in such an affair. 
EYRE 8081 Did he say who the people were that were to execute this
ROSS 8082 He did not. 
GARROW 8083 This plan of Watt’s, I understand you, was read at a meeting of the committee 
ROSS 8084 Yes; but I look upon it to be totally drawn up by himself; I never saw it till that night when he produced it. 
GARROW 8085 How many members of the grand committee might be present when Watt read his first plan
ROSS 8086 There were five, J think; a Mr. Stock, myself, Watt, Downie, and Bonthron. Of how many was the committee of Ways and Means composed ?—Of seven altogether. 
GARROW 8087 So that there were five out of those seven present
ROSS 8088 Yes. 
GARROW 8089 When Watt read this paper, what passed upon it in the committee 
ROSS 8090 No farther passed upon it than that I objected to it, as soon as I understood he had done reading; I said I would by no means agree to any thing that was to disturb the peace, or that tended to shed the blood of my countrymen; Mr. Bonthron agreed along with me; he said, by no means; and, finding we made opposition to 
GARROW 8091 Upon his proposing the second’ phan, when that paper, there was no farther commentpassed about it
ROSS 8092 There was nothing passed made upon it Do you remember, at any other time, Mr. Watt producing either the same plan with any enlargement, or any new plan or scheme, for any thing to be put in execution at Edinburgh?—I remember his reading a aper: 
GARROW 8093 When
ROSS 8094 One of the last times that I was at that committee; the last, or last but one; I ami not positive which. 
GARROW 8095 How many persons were present
ROSS 8096 I cannot recollect ; but it was on a night when the committee used to meet. 
GARROW 8097 The great or sub-committee
ROSS 8098 The subcommittee. 
GARROW 8099 What was the plan proposed by Watt at that sub-committee meeting 
ROSS 8100 It was rather a copy of a proclamation, as I collected it, prohibiting all farmers, dealers in corn, meal,) 
GARROW 8101 ar hay, to remove the same from their respective places of abode, under pain of death. 
EYRE 8102 Were you present at that meeting too
ROSS 8103 Yes. 
EYRE 8104 How soon was shat after the first
ROSS 8105 I could not recollect; I 
EYRE 8106 think I was only five nights at that committee altegether. 
EYRE 8107 Was it the next night after, or later
ROSS 8108 I rather think it might he two weeks after that. ‘ Mr. Garrow.—This proclamation forbids all farmers, dealers in cern, meal, or hay, to Femove the same under pain of death? Yes; and also to all gentlemen residing in the eountry, not to leave their respective habitations for a greater distance than three miles, under the same penalty ; these, as far as I can recollect, were the contents of that Vs bag 
EYRE 8109 Was there any thing in that address relative to his majesty 
ROSS 8110 On the other side of the paper there was a copy of an address to his majesty. 
EYRE 8111 For what purpose 
ROSS 8112 Ordering him to dismiss his present ministers, and to put an end 40 this bloody war, or he might expect bad consequences ; it either ran this way—that be might expect bad consequences, or he might abide by the consequences; I could not understand which. 
EYRE 8113 When was this proclamation, according to Watt’s representation, in that committee, to be carried into execution
ROSS 8114 The paper mentioned, I think, that this copy of an address was to be sent to his majesty the morning after the attack. 
EYRE 8115 Was the attack that you describe, the drawing the soldiers from the Castle, &c.
ROSS 8116 I could look upon it in no other light than that this was to strengthen that plan which he had read in the former committee. 
EYRE 8117 Was it explained by him, in the committee, what was to be done with those soldiers when they should he so surrounded 
ROSS 8118  Nor with the magistrates?—He did‘ not enter into particulars, upon it, for when he had read. that paper, I said, Mp. Watt, these things do pag ad to the cause of reform, and. I would by no means agree to any such things. 
EYRE 8119 Had you been a member of the British Convention at Edinburgh
ROSS 8120 Yes. 
EYRE 8121 Were you present at the passing of any of their solemn resolutions 
ROSS 8122 No; I was not. 
EYRE 8123 Do you know a person of the name of Orrock 
ROSS 8124 Yes. 
EYRE 8125 Do you know of any order he received from Watt to form any offensive instruments of any sort
ROSS 8126 Yes; Mr. Watt called upon me one day, and wished me to take a walk to Robert Orrock’s ; when I went there, he told him that he wished him to make some pikes, and, as far as I can recollect, Orrock drew a 
EYRE 8127 ‘model, upon the table, or something. 
EYRE 8128 What trade is Orrock 
ROSS 8129 A smith. 
EYRE 8130 Did he reside in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh 
ROSS 8131 Yes, within a mile. He sketched it out upona slate, or upon a board ; hesad he had four thousand to send-to Perth, besides what he had to distribute about Edinburg); ‘that was all that I remember. 
EYRE 8132 Do you know that, in point of fact, Orrock did make some pikes for Watt, in consequent of that order
ROSS 8133 I only knew it since was in confinement. 
EYRE 8134 Do you know of any having been found in Watt's or Orrock’s houses 
ROSS 8135 I never saw one of them. 
EYRE 8136 You mentioned a person of the name of Stock, who was present at this last meeting st which you and Watt were present 
ROSS 8137 Yes. 
EYRE 8138 Did Mr. Stock, at that time, mention any lace to which he was going
ROSS 8139 I remember fe did; he said, as far as I can recollect, that he was either going to London, or to Bristol. 
EYRE 8140 Did. he mention any person in London is particular upon whom he intended to wait, ia order to establish'a mode of correspondence with Mr. Watt
ROSS 8141 He said by desire of Mr. Watt that he would wait upon Mr. Hardy, Mr. Watt sending. a letter along with him t Mr. Hardy. 
EYRE 8142 For what purpose: wae he to wait upon Mr. Hardy 
ROSS 8143 As far as I could understand it, Mr. Stock said he would take a letter to Mr. Hardy, and that he would do every thing his power to-establish a correspondence between the two. What two-do you mean, Hardy and Watt?—Yes, as far as I' understood him. 
EYRE 8144 Do you remember Stock writing any thing then, as a plan of correspondence himself and any other person 
ROSS 8145 I : he took a sheet of paper, and divided rt; he marked upon one side, the aristocrats sre doing so and so, om the other; the democrats 90 and so; —. all I can recollect a act 
EYRE 8146 What was that paper represented to —Watt wished a correspondence betweet Hardy and him ; he- mentioned that he wish ed:to corfspond ina safe metited; and: he gave him this as a plan how he might corres- a plan, and point it out to the attention of the pond ie safety; that was the plan he mentioned. 
EYRE 8147 Was any thing said at that meeting of Stock’s calling aguin upon Watt on the subject of his going to London 
ROSS 8148 Watt said if he would call upon him next day, he should have the letter. 
EYRE 8149 Did you see any thing more of Stock 
ROSS 8150 I never say any thing more of him after that. 
ERSKINE 8151  Whether any letter was ever written to Mr. Hardy you do not know 
MCEWAN 8152 No. 
ERSKINE 8153 Or whether Mr. Hardy ever desired his correspondence you do not know 
MCEWAN 8154 I know nothing about it. 
ERSKINE 8155 Were you a member of the Society of the Friends of the People in Edinburgh 
MCEWAN 8156 I was, of a society at the Water of Leith. 
ERSKINE 8157 What was this sub-committee at which Watt, Downie, and other persons attended 
MCEWAN 8158 A sub-committee, which I looked upon to be for the purpose of looking into the finances of Mr. Skirving, for this reason, that Skirving had wrote a Teter that there was twenty pounds owing to him. 
ERSKINE 8159 What was the object of your society 
MCEWAN 8160 A parliamentary reform. 
ERSKINE 8161 What number did your society consist of? — 1 suppose about twenty. 
ERSKINE 8162 Were you in the convention 
MCEWAN 8163 Yes. 
ERSKINE 8164 How many of the meetings did you attend in the convention when it sat 
MCEWAN 8165 I could not say; I might be half a dozen nights there. 
ERSKINE 8166 Were you there when it was dispersed? when the magistrates came in 
MCEWAN 8167 Yes. 
ERSKINE 8168 During all the time you attended this convention, did you ever hear, from any of the members, any such talk as Watt indulged himself in at the committee 
MCEWAN 8169 Never. 
ERSKINE 8170 Would you have set your foot into the convention if’ Watt, or any body else, had been talking of seizing ue the judges, and sendin g an address to the kin 
ERSKINE 8171 Non would not have would you
MCEWAN 8172 No. 
ERSKINE 8173 Was there any thing of that sort in the convention 
MCEWAN 8174 No. 
ERSKINE 8175 You never saw any thing of that sort
MCEWAN 8176 No. 
ERSKINE 8177 dione such a thing, 
ERSKINE 8178 From all you ever saw or heard of the members there, what do you believe the convention met to do
MCEWAN 8179 As far as I could understand it, they met to obtain a parliamentary reform. 
ERSKINE 8180 How did you understand, from the general conversation and debates in the society, that they meant to set about obtaining that A—By 2 petition. 
ERSKINE 8181 Do not grrurecdlioet it was said, that alapie ge parli t might not be disposed, as it had not been disposed to listen to petitions of small bodies of men, when no specific plan of reform was yet if a vast number of the people of England were to agree upon paiement, very probably it would meet with gd ate 
MCEWAN 8182 I do not oe that. ere they to have petitioned that ni or how was that todone avThat Sey night when the convention was dispersed, it was to have come under consideration, either to petition the House of Commons, or the 
ERSKINE 8183 King, as far as I can recollect. 
EYRE 8184 Had there been any notice given of such a motion 
MCEWAN 8185 IHt was given the night before, as far as I heard. 
ERSKINE 8186 You heard so in the convention 
MCEWAN 8187 Yes. 
EYRE 8188 Do not you com found that with an Address to the Nation 
MCEWAN 8189  —I do not recollect that. 
ERSKINE 8190 Have you seen the books lately 
MCEWAN 8191 No. 
ERSKINE 8192 Or heard them read 
MCEWAN 8193 No, F never put pen to paper upon the subject; F never correspounded with any man upon the subject. 
ERSKINE 8194 Of how many did the convention consist
MCEWAN 8195 I could not say. 
ERSKINE 8196 But of how many do you suppose they consisted 
MCEWAN 8197 Near two hundred I dare say. 
ERSKINE 8198 Had you ever any arms 
MCEWAN 8199 I never saw one. 
ERSKINE 8200 In any of the debates, that took place among the members of that. convention, was it ever proposed that they should arm them selves to overturn the government 
MCEWAN 8201 I never heard it. 
ERSKINE 8202 Was any thing said to that effect in the convention 
MCEWAN 8203 I never heard it in the convention. 
ERSKINE 8204 Was it ever proposed that they should have arms, im order to defend themselves against the magistracy, and to insist upon making laws instead of the parliament 
MCEWAN 8205 I never heard of arms in one place or another, til Watt asked me to go that day to Mr. Orrock’s. 
ERSKINE 8206 Did Watt ever say any thing of that sort in the convention when you were there 
MCEWAN 8207 I' do not know. 
ERSKINE 8208 Was he a member of the convention 
MCEWAN 8209 That I do not know any thing about. 
ERSKINE 8210 As soon as Watt mentioned this, you say you rejected it with indignation
MCEWAN 8211 Yes, Mr. Bonthron and me rejected it. 
ERSKINE 8212 What sort of people did your socicty consist of 2—Working people. 
ERSKINE 8213 In your society was it ever proposed or debated among you to overturn the govctnment
MCEWAN 8214 No. 
ERSKINE 8215 What sort of a reform was it you wanted 
MCEWAN 8216 The reform most of them spoke of was universal suffrage and annual parliaments ; some were of that way of thinking, some for triennial iorige pate as settled at the Revolution. 
ERSKINE 8217 Ww did you understand by universal suffrage 
MCEWAN 8218 The people at large to have thc choice of their representatives. 
ERSKINE 8219 Was it ever debated, or was it ever proposed: that the king’s persan or his throne were to be touched
MCEWAN 8220 I never heard that mentioned. 8 
ERSKINE 8221 Were you to petition for any alteration in the House of Lords, or any thing of that sort
MCEWAN 8222 No, to petition the House of Commons, or the King. 
GARROW 8223 What was the Committee of Union for
MCEWAN 8224 I can give no information as to that. Upon your oath, was not the Committee of Union after the dispersion of the British Convention, for the purpose of establishing a new convention, a convention of emergency ?—Upon my oath I never heard at all,—I never was in it but that night when the letter was read from Skirving. I was never in it but that night I mention. 
GARROW 8225 Oh! then a sub-committee formed out of the Committee of Union 
MCEWAN 8226 The first night I was in that committee, which is styled a Committee of Union, that letter was read from Skirving: the next night again I was appointed a member of this sub-committee, and what was going on in that Committee of Union I know not. 
GARROW 8227 Do you mean to represent that the purpose of the committee of Union, as well as that of Ways and Means, was only relative to Skirving’s letter about his own finances.—I ask you was it not for the purpose of establishing a fund far a new convention 
MCEWAN 8228 All the transactions I ever saw was in that light. 
GARROW 8229 You can give no account what the Committee of Union was for
MCEWAN 8230 No, I was never in but that night that I was appointed a member of the sub-committee, 
GARROW 8231 You would not have gone into the convention, if you had had an idea of employing an force, or touching the king’s majesty, or at all encroaching upon the constitution, or producing in short a reform, but by peaceable means
MCEWAN 8232 No. 
GARROW 8233 Did you know that your convention had resolved : “ That this convention, considering the calamitous consequences of any act of the Icgislature, which may tend to deprive the whole, or any part of the peole of their undoubted right to meet, either yy themselves, or by delegation, to discuss any matter relative to their common snr whether of a public or private nature; ani holding the same tobe totally inconsistent with the first principles and safety of society ; and also subversive of our known and acknowledged constitutional liberties ; — do hereby declare, before God and the world, that we shall follow the wholesome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which shall militate against the constitution of our country; and shall continue to assemble and consider of the best means by which we can accomplish a real representation of the people, and annual election ; until compelled to desist by seperr force 
MCEWAN 8234 I do not remember any such thing. 
GARROW 8235 Do not you know that with reat solemnity the convention had come to that resolution
MCEWAN 8236 No, I do not know that. 
GARROW 8237 Did you not know that the convention had resolved, that in certain emergencies, they should declare their sittings permanent 
MCEWAN 8238 No, I did not know that neither. 
GARROW 8239 Nor that it should be constituted, and proceed to business, as svon as twenty-one should be met 
MCEWAN 8240 No. 
GARROW 8241 Did you not know that the convention resolved that the delegates were to hold themselves ready to depart at an hour's warning, and to repair to the place of mecting appointed by the committee of emergency.— Did you
MCEWAN 8242 I have heard of that, but only know of that by hearsay. 
GARROW 8243 You have heard the delegates were to meet at an hour's notice 
MCEWAN 8244 I heard it mentioned that they were to have another convention, and that the sociclty were to get information respecting that other meeting. 
GARROW 8245 That iivey were to be furnished with information 
MCEWAN 8246 That they were to get information. 
GARROW 8247 Who was to furnish them with it
MCEWAN 8248 I do not know. mM : 
GARROW 8249 Upon your oath, do not you know it was to be a convention of emergency 
MCEWAN 8250 No. 
GARROW 8251 The purpose of this new convention. I take it for granted, was only to petition parliament for a reform 
MCEWAN 8252 That was the purpose of the society I belonged to. And that was to be, the purpose of the new convention ?—I could not say as to that at all. This pestleinen has got you to say, thag you would not have remained for a moment in the convention, if you had had the idea of any force being employed; upon your oath, how came you to attend a second meeting of the sub-committee, with Watt, who had proposed a plan for drawing down the soldiers from the castle, in order to have them surrounded by the Friends of the People, and for carrying that first plan into execution —How came you to meet him at a second meeting, when he was enlarging upon that plan ?—I did not know that he would repeat it again. Did-you go and inform aay magistrate of such a plot ?—No, but I informed the sheriff, Did you inform the sheriff of the first plan, before Watt communicated the second ?—No. 
EYRE 8253 You are asking this man to go the length of convicting himself of high treason
MCEWAN 8254 The Court oughtto take care in the examination of a witness, that he is not called upon to accuse himself—He is upon very perilous pround. 1 am not quite sure that you would be permitted to make use of a man’s evidence against himself so obtained, or I would not have permitted it to have gone omso long. 
GARROW 8255 It has been examined to on the other side. 
EYRE 8256 It is difficult to say that a question should be asked on one side, which should not be controverted by examination on the other side; witnesses therefore should understand to what they sube ject themselves. 
EYRE 8257 M Eo:an
MCEWAN 8258 My Lord, I am not ci calibed with these things, and I hope your lordship will protect me. 
GARROW 8259 Did you search the house of Watt, who was executed at Edinburgh
MCEWAN 8260 Yes, I searched his house upon the 15th of May last. 
GARROW 8261 Did you find any pikes in his house 
MCEWAN 8262  Yes. 
ERSKINE 8263 This was after Mr. Hardy was taken up. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8264 It has now been spoken of, that Watt gave orders for pikes— we shall be able to prove by the time at which the orders were given, that it was before Hardy was apprehended. 
EYRE 8265 That cannot be admitted. 
EYRE 8266 The Court was about to adjourn.] 
ERSKINE 8267 My lords this is the fourth day that my friend Mr. Gibbs and myself, have stood undoubtedly in a very anxious situation; there has been a most voluminous body of written evidence, all of which has not been printed; copies of that part which is unprinted, have not as yet reached me : there have been two days spent in hearing parole evidence ; and we being but two assigned as counsel for the prisoner, have been obliged constantly to be engaged in court, in Cross-examining the witnesses for the crown ; and your lordships very well know, that the ¢ross-examination of the witnesses, presents a great feature of our case on the part of the prisoner
MCEWAN 8268 A great deal of that has fallen upon me : your lordships must be sensible it is impossible I could at the time of crossexamining a witness, take any particular note of what he has said—When the evidence for the crown was near closing, as I thought, I humbly requested of your Torlships for the indulgence of an hour or two to look over the papers; your lordships were pleased to grant my request, which I considered as a personal civility to myself—I was prevented by extreme sickness, from availing myself of those two hours, for I was extremely ill, and nothing less than a case of this magnitude could have brought me into this court.—Since that time I bave nothad natural rest, for I have not got home till between two and three o'clock in the morning, and have been here again at nine; so that I can say, with a safe conscience, I have not had an opportunity of casting m eye upon any part of the evidence, though trust I have something of the general result of itin my mind.—TI should hope, under these circumstances, the prisoner may be indulged with some opportunity, for my friend Mr. Gibbs and myself, to arrange our papers, and consider them together as counsel for the prisoner, before we are called upon to make our defence : and it is necessary to do this, not for my address to the jury only, but it is necessary when J address the jury, that I present them the prisoner's case, that depends much upon the arrangement of the evidence ; —and I feel nyself in no condition todo this, either ina manner that is respectful, or fit for the Court, or for the safety of the prisoner.—I do not wish to impose any particular time, but merely to leave it to the indulgence and jus tice of the Court, perfectly sure when I leave it there, I leave it in a safe place. 
EYRE 8269 I feel the weight of your observations, of the difficulty under which you labour, in an extraordinary case, which can hardly be judged of by the common rules on which we proceed in cases of this nature; the Court are of a disposition to give you all the indulgence they Repsihly can, because there is a vast mass of evidence; the case arises out of the evidence, and it is fit the case should be thoroughly canvassed
MCEWAN 8270 At the same time, it is certainly notorious that the great bulk of that evidence has been in print a great while, and I cannot believe that it has not been very well considered as far as it has been in print. I am sure that must be un derstood. 
EYRE 8271 Now I will tell you very fairly, if the question were only the personal accommodation of yourself and Mr. Gibbs, at the expense of the personal convenience of myself, my lord, and my brothers, I am quite sure we should have no difficulty in the sacrifice of our personal convenience; but there is a great deal more in the case,—we have a jury who have been thrown into the most arduous service that ever I sawa jury engagedin: they have borne it in a manner that does them infinite honour, and I have no doubt but that as far as it is necessary that they should continue in the situation they are in, that they will bear it chearfully
MCEWAN 8272 I have seen such a specimen of their behaviour, that I cannot entertain 2 doubt of that; but that we could give you an absolute suspension of the business in the situation that we are in, upon the terms of keeping the jury in the situation in which they must be kept, is athing that it is perfectly impossible for us to think of. Now this occurs to me; my brothers will consider of it; I merely throw it out for their consideration.—You are men of honour, you will tell us whether you really do mean to call witnesses, or to take the case upon the ground upon which it is already made : If you mean tocall witnesses, you may call them to-morrow ; 
EYRE 8273 ou may go on with the case as far as it will e necessary for you to go on, to fillup all the time that ought to be filled up, leaving only a part of Sunday, the common interval of rest, without our keeping the jury in a situation to do nothing
MCEWAN 8274 If you do not mean to call witnesses, but mean to leave the case with the observations which arise upon the evidence that is before the Court, we will go as far as we can; but if witnesses are to be called, and you desire not to address the jury immediately, you must immediately begin to examine your witnesses, as soon as they have closed en the part of the crown; and fill up the time that will intervene between that time and the time when you will be ready to go on with your address to the jury.—In that way I think we shall put the jury under no unnecessary hardships, because whether they hear the witnesses before or after the specch, is a matter of no importance to them. 
ERSKINE 8275 I should be afraid to take upon myself the experiment of trying a cause, particularly of this magnitude, in a manner totally different from any that ever occurred in the annals of this country. I should be afraid to begin an experiment of that sort, more especially when counsel in a capital case; because undoubtedly the evidence comes with infinitely more weight, and I mean by weight the proper weight evidence ought to have, the ing of it upon the case when stated by the counsel, who is to introduce it; and much of the effect of evidence is lost, and much distorted by the cross-examination of counsel, until the true bearing of it is explained. I do not propose that which can be properly termed a suspension of the trial, that could throw that sort of inconvenience upon the jury, which would, I am sure, give me as much pain as any body in the world; but your lordships will recollect the attorney general in opening his case (I am sure I think as highly as it is possible of the ability of the attorney general, and of the manzer in which he pertormed his duty), he found it necessary undoubtedly to spend nine hours in the opening of that case, —the prisoner most unquestionably may exoe an equal time, if it were necessary, for is counsel te take the same course in opening his case; and if I were thrown upon it in the present moment, not having a sufficient recollection af the great points of the evidence; df I were put upon speaking to the jury, I might take that course of ing at great Jength, great umbers of 3; whereas, if i had the opportunity of a few hours mene, which is the nature of my application, merely to arrange my papers, and to select such as, in the judgment of my learned friend and myself, are sufficient to do this as it ought to be done, it would save time. 
EYRE 8276 I dread the explanation ofa few hours; Mr. Attorney Gesere what farther evidence have you to pro
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8277 I think my evidence will not take up more than forty minutes, 
ERSKINE 8278 I do not know whether your lordships mean to sit on Sunday. 
EYRE 8279 tI shall sit late on Saturday night ; I say ing of Sunday. 
ERSKINE 8280 I am literally at this moment, and I have been all day yesterday and to-da: so extremely unwell, that I do not think if were called upon to speak for aay length of time, I could possibly support it. 
EYRE 8281 i can casily think that to be the case, and it is a circumstanceIam extremely sorry for; on the other hand, I cannot hazard the situation of the jury. 
ERSKINE 8282 I should be sorry to put the jury to any inconvenience
MCEWAN 8283 I do not shrink from the business ; I am extremely willing to suffer any thing, but I assureyoyr lordship that my health is extremely suffering by it. 
EYRE 8284 What is it you ask for? 
ERSKINE 8285 As I stated before, the attorney general found it necessary to consume nine hours, I shall not consume half that time,—certainly I think I shall not consume half that time, if I bad an opportunity of doing that which I humbly request of the court, that is, of arranging the materials in such a manner that I should be able to make those observations which occur to me to be the proper observations to be made, as counsel for the prisoner. 
EYRE 8286 Wehave offcred you an expedient; neither of you say to us whether you can accept it, 
GIBBS 8287 With respect to that expedient T have no douht to say, that it is utterly impossible for Mr. Erskine and myself, in the situation in which we are, respecting uurselves, respecting the Court, and respecting the public, pe the jury, it is utterly impossible for us to think of that, because if any thing adverse should happen when we have taken such a line, the imputation will lie upon us. 
EYRE 8288 That it may not be in your judgment a desirable thing is very well, but that there is any other objection to it, I cannot agree to. Whether the case is taken upon the summing up of the evidence, or whether it is taken upon the opening of the evidence, is as to all legal purpose the same; I can see no difference: it may make a vast difference in your judgmeut, as to whet is the best manner and the best method of laying your case before the jury ; undoubtedly we are assisting the prisoner by putting the counsel in a situation to do his business in the best manner, by proposing it thus; whereas if they were put u Going it in the ordi course, they would lie under a peculiar di culty and disadvantage. Mr. Erskine has act yet told us what he asks. 
ERSKINE 8289 Since it is put expressly to me, I shall propose, unless the jury professaa very serious inconvenience to them, instead of coming in the morning at the time we generally come, our coming at twelve o'clock, 80 that the attorney g: can finish at one. Mr. Gibbs will have the goodness to take a note of the few facts stated Ly the witnesses 5 I shall be able by that time to come. 
EYRE 8290 Then suppose we adjoura to eleven o'clock. 
GIBBS 8291 We conceive your lordships will permit Mr. Erskine to open the case of Mr. any: then our witnesses will be examined, and then I shall be heard after ous witnesses, 
EYRE 8292 You will conduet your case in the manner you think best for the interest of your client. 
ERSKINE 8293 I should be glad if your lordships would allow another hour. 
EYRE 8294 I feel so much for the situation of the jury, that on their account I cannot think of it. 
ERSKINE 8295 My lord, I never was placed in such a situation in the whole course of my practice before, with so many gentlemen on the other side; however, I do not shrink from iy 
JURYMEMBER 8296 My lord, we are extremely willing to allow Mr. Erskine another hour, if ee lordship thinks proper. 
EYRE 8297 As the jury ask it for you, I will not refuse you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8298 I am now going to call a witness to prove that a paper was found in the possession of Mr. Thelwall, and also to prove that another paper of the same sort was found in the possession of Mr. Martin, being of the hand-writing of Martin. These papers were found after the apprehension of Mr. Hardy. When I have proved that the papers were found in the possession of Martin and of Thelwall, I shall then go on to prove by a witness or two, whom t shall call for that purpose, that they existed in the possession of each of them long before the apprehension of Mr. Hardy: they purport upon the face of them to be iagered for the general meetin; of the Corresponding Society, upon the 14¢! of April, 1794, at Chalk Farm. 
GIBBS 8299 Your lordship secs that the evidence offered is that these papers, after the apprehension of Mr. Hardy, were found in the possession of Mr. Martin and Mr. Thelwall, merely that they. were in their possession, not that they were ever used by them, it does not appear but that they might have got into their possession again, but simply that they were in their custody as a newspaper is in my hand this morning, and may pass inte other hands. 
EYRE 8300 The only ground upon which any paper is objected to as evidence, found after the apprehension of the party, is Sot by possibility the paper might Dot have existed, or might not have been in the hands of the person till after his apprehension ; that is the only gecanil upon which the evidence is refused; if they remove that ground of objection, it is admissible. 
GIBBS 8301 I understand the rule generally to go to any paper that was in the hands of any one daa I understand that to be the principle. 
EYRE 8302 That goes rather to the effect of the evidence, than to the admissibility; it being found in the possession of the parties before the apprehension, removes in fact the objection. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8303 Mr. Martin and Mr. Thelwall, in whose custody the papers were found, were persons who, together with Mr. Hardy, were appointed to prepare the proceedings for the Chalk Farm meeting. 
EYRE 8304 I observed that that goes more to the effect of the evidence, than, to its admissibility. ‘ 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8305 Where did you find that paper 
MCEWAN 8306 [showing it tb the witness]—In Mr. Thelwall’s house. When you apprehended him?—After he was taken away; I remained to bring away the papers. Upon what day?—On the night of the 13th of May, or the morning of the 14th. It was the morning of the 14th. 
GIBBS 8307 Look at that paper
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8308 [showing it to the witness. ]—I found this in Mr. Martin's chest in the King’s-beneh prison. 
GIBBS 8309 When did you find it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8310 On the 29th of May. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8311 Look at that paper do you know whose hand-writing that is 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8312 I believe it ta be Mr. Martin’s hand. writing. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8313 Have you seen him write 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8314 I have. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8315 Whose hand-writing do you believe that to be
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8316 I' believe that also to be Mr. Martin’s hand-writing. 
GIBBS 8317 Did you ever see Mr. Martin write
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8318 Yes, frequently. 
GIBBS 8319 You did live in the Adelphi, I believe 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8320 I did. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8321 You were confined in the King’s-benth prison, I believe, fur debt 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8322 Yes. When did you leave the King’s-hench ?—I cannot rightly tell, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8323 How long ago
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8324 I suppose six or seven months ago. I Icft it on the 31st of July. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8325 How long had you been there 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8326 Near two years, i you know John Martin ?— Perfectly well. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8327 Was hea prisoner there 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8328 He was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8329 Do you remember, while you were in the King’s Bench, ever secing either of the papers now put into your hand 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8330 I remember perfectly well seeing both the papers. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8331 When was it that you saw them 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8332 I believe about the beginning of April. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8333 Look at the top of this paper, and tell me whether it was before the date there mentioned, or not
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8334 It was before this time. 
EYRE 8335 Where did you see them 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8336 In the room where Martin was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8337 Had you any conversation with Martin at that time 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8338 I had be told me he wrote the resolutions for the society at Chalk Farm; he had a copy of them, and read them several times in the room. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8339 Look at the other paper, and tell my lord and the jury whether those are the papers which he read several times in the room, or not
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8340 I really cannot recollect; he often read them to one Pearce, who used to come to see him; he said he wrote the resolutions for Chalk Farm, and that there was plenty of cayenne in them; and if they followed his advice or example, there would be warm work among them before the month of May was out. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8341 Did you know Pearce 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8342 Perfectly well. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8343 Did he use to come there
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8344 He took the resolutions from Martin to Chalk Farm. 
GIBBS 8345 How do you know that
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8346 I saw Martin give the papers to Pearce. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8347 Was Mrs. Evans, your wife, with you
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8348 Yes, she was, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8349 Was Mr. Tourll present at that time 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8350 He was there when Mr. Martin mentioned about the resolutions, that he had put plenty of pepper in them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8351 Did theyseethese papers as well as you
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8352 My wife saw them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8353 Did they hear the declarations of Martin, you have stated them, as well as you
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8354 Yes. 
GIBBS 8355  What are you
MR_EVANS 8356 TI was fortherly a grocer. 
GIBBS 8357  Were you in the King’s-bench prison for debt 
MR_EVANS 8358 Yes. 
GIBBS 8359 For two years I think you say 
MR_EVANS 8360 Nearly. 
GIBBS 8361 Had you any difference with Mr. Martin there
MR_EVANS 8362 We had a difference last of all; Mr. Martin wished to have the room I was in to himself. 
GIBBS 8363 I do not want to know the reason of your difference, you had a violent quarrel 
MR_EVANS 8364 N o; we had no quarrel, only a dispute. 
GIBBS 8365 You never uttered any expressions of resentment or threats against him, did you
MR_EVANS 8366 Never. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8367 Was there a man of the name of Gay in the King’s bench prison at the time that Martin was there 
MR_EVANS 8368 There was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8369 At the end of Martin’s letter he mentions Gay. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8370 You are the wife of the gentleman who gave evidence just now 
MR_EVANS 8371 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8372 You attended your husband, I believe, in the King’s-bench prison
MR_EVANS 8373  Yes; I went backwards and forwards to him. ve you know Mr. Martin?—Yes; very well. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8374 Did you ever see these papers before, look at them ? [showing them to the witness.
MR_EVANS 8375 Yes; I have seen them both. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8376 Where may you have seen them 
MR_EVANS 8377 In the King’s-bench. - an 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8378 In whose room or possession
MR_EVANS 8379 In Mr. Evans’s room, in Mr. Martin’s possession. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8380 When was it that you saw them there ; was it before or after the month stated at the top
MR_EVANS 8381 It was in that month, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8382 Did you happen to hear Mr. Martin say any thing respecting these papers; and if he said any thing, what was it that he did say 
MR_EVANS 8383 I remember his reading this papers particularly mentioning that it is not lawful to take up arms against the king; he read the through, but there is nothing more I recollect, as I was passing to and fro, but those words, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8384 Did you hear him say any thing else, except what he said about the paper 
MR_EVANS 8385  Nothing else; there were three gentlemen present, to whom he read it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8386 Was there any talk about Chalk-farrn
MR_EVANS 8387 Yes; I heard him mention that he had drawn the resolutions up for Chalk-farm. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8388 Did he say any thing else
MR_EVANS 8389 He said if they kept by his resolutions, they were very warm ones, for he had put plenty of Cayenne into them, and that there wi be very warm work. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8390 Do you remember a person of the name of Pearce coming there 
MR_EVANS 8391 Perfectly well; Mr. Martin’s clerk. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8392 Had Martin and Pearce any conversation about these papers, or Chalk-farm 
MR_EVANS 8393 I heard none till he brought the resolutions printed : Pearce said he had had many of them, but that he had distributed them among the workmen of a Coach-maker in Long- Acre, but that Mr. Hardy had a great many more printed, and that he could get more. 
GIBBS 8394 Your lordskips see this is not evidence against Mr. Hardy; in fact, it is not the more evidence for Hardy's name being mentioned, than if it was not mentioned. 5 
EYRE 8395 I do not know that it is, 
GIBBS 8396  What resolutions were those that Mr. Martin spoke of
MRS_EVANS 8397 For the meeting of the London Corresponding Society at a dancing room in Tottenham Court Road, and that they removed from thence to Chalk-farm. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8398 Do you know what street that is in
MRS_EVANS 8399 No. 
GIBBS 8400 Can you swear that these are the very papers that you saw in Mr. Martin's hand 
MRS_EVANS 8401 I can. 
GIBBS 8402 Were they ever put into your hand to read
MRS_EVANS 8403 They were not; but Ihave had them in my hand frequently. 
GIBBS 8404 Since 
MRS_EVANS 8405 No, at that time. 
GIBBS 8406 You have frequently read them 
MRS_EVANS 8407 Yes. 
GIBBS 8408 You amused yourself with looking into Mr. Martin's papers when he was not there
MRS_EVANS 8409 And when he was present likewise. 
GIBBS 8410 When you speak of the copies that Pearce said had been give among the Coach-makers, do you mean to say that they were copies of these papers
MRS_EVANS 8411 'They were the resolutions printed. 
GIBBS 8412 But you do not mean that they were copies of those which are now put into court? 
EYRE 8413 I did not understand them to be the originals, or copies of the resolutions read at Chalk-farm, but that Martin said, at the time they saw these papers, that he had prepared the resolutions x Chalk-farm, and that the paper brought by Pearce was a printed copy of those resolutions; unless this shall turn out to be the original of the resolutions, it amounts to nothing. 
GIBBS 8414 I know it is not, but I thought that mistake might arise. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8415 I believe you had the misfortune to be in the King’s-bench poss about the months of 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8416 March and April Jast —Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8417 Da you know Mr. John Martin at all 
MRS_EVANS 8418 I 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8419 know him by frequently seeing him in Mr. Evans’s room; I never knew him before he came there. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8420 That is the husband of the lady who was here just now 
MRS_EVANS 8421 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8422 Did you ever see this paper before? —No. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8423 Did you hear Martin say any thing about the Chalk-farm meeting
MRS_EVANS 8424 I did. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8425 Be so good as state what you heard him say 
MRS_EVANS 8426 One orang, when I called in at Mr. Evans’s room, Mr. Martin came in. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8427 What month was that in
MRS_EVANS 8428 I believe in April; it was three or four days before the Chalk- farm business. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8429 State what Mr. Martin said in your hearing, about the Chalk-farm business 
MRS_EVANS 8430 Mr. Martin came in, and tbe business of Chalk-farm came up; he asked meif I had read any thing of it—I told him I had not; in conyersation, he said he had drawn up, and I think he said he had sent the resolutions; I am certain he said he drew them up, and, he said, if they followed the resolutions, there would be warm. work, for he had put in plenty of Cayenne. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8431 Was there aman of the name of Gay in prison at that time 
MRS_EVANS 8432 There was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8433 Were he and Martin much together 
MRS_EVANS 8434 Very often. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8435 t will readpresently a-rcsolution of the Constitutional Society, relative to that Mr. Gay; his name occurs in that letter, and I think he appears to be proposed as a member to that societ; by Mr. Tooke. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8436 Did you see Pearce there 
MRS_EVANS 8437 I have seen: him there two or three times. 7 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8438 Perhaps you had not occasion to observe any particular communication between them
MRS_EVANS 8439 I had not. 7 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8440 Now LI take it there is no objection to reading the paper; therefore I desire it may be read, and I would beg of your lordships and the jury, not only to attend to what is left in the paper, but to what is struck out of it to look at the paper itself. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8441 “ At a general Meeting of the London Corresponding Society, held at — on Monday, the 14th day of April, 1794. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8442 “ Citizen in the chair. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8443 “ Resolved, That all meee ens legislative, and judicial powers, are the rights of the people; and though the people have delegated those their original powers to others, in trust, for the benefit of the community, yet the rights themselves are reserved by the people, and cannot be absolutely parted with by the people to those persons who are employed to conduct the business of the state. J 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8444 “ Resolved, That the constitution of England is held by the King, Lords, and Commons, and other officers appointed by the people in trust, for the benefit of the people ; and though these trustees may regulate and improve the constitution, yet they cannot alter or subvert it without committing treasom against the nation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8445 Resolved, That Magna Charta, or THE GREAT CHARTER OF THE LIBERTIES OF ENGLAND, made in the reign of king John; THE PETITION OF RIGHTS, assented to by parliament in the reign of kin: Charles 1st and the several laws made at ani in consequence of the Glorious Revolution in the year 1688, are declaratory of those parts of the constitution of England, which are iar and by them respectively declared. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8446 “ Resolved, That the office of KING of England was not instituted by the people merely as an office of profit and honour to the king, but he was so appointed as chief trustee and guardian of the constitution and rights of the people, and that important and laborious penal duties are annexed to the regal office, the objects of which are to promote the good of the people, and preserve their rights in full vigour from innovation and corruption. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8447 Resolved, That it is the duty of the king to preserve the constitution of England and the rights of the people against every encroachment; and in order to enforce that duty, the following oath is required to be taken by every king on his accession to the throne of Great Britain, to wit: the arch-bishop or bishop shall say—“ Will you solemnlypro“ mise and swear to govern the people of this “kingdom of England, and the dominions thereto belonging, according to the statutes “in parliament agreed on, and the laws and customs of the same?’ 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8448 he king or queen shall say, ‘ I solemnly “promise so to do.’ Archbishop or bishop— Will you to your power cause law and jus‘tice in mercy to be executed in all your judgments?’ ANS. ‘I will’ 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8449 “ After this, the king or queen, laying his or her hand on the holy Gospels, shall say— ‘The things which I have before promised I “will perform and keep; so help me God’ and then shall kiss the book. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8450 “ Resolved, That his present majesty, kin, George 8rd, on his accession to the throne o these realms, did solemnly take the said oath. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8451 “ Resolved, That the constitutional rights of the people have been violated, and that it is the duty of the people, in the present atarming crisis, to assemble and inquire into the innovations or infringements which have been made upon the rights of the people, and how far the declarations of the constitution, as they were settled at the aforesaid Revolution, remain in force, and which of them have been violated, and by whom; and also whether such innovations, infringements, and violations, have been committed from the negligence or corruption of those who have been intrusted with the government of the state. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8452 “ Resolved, That this society do invite the ee to meet in their respective nighbourjoods, to elect one or more person or persons as delegates to meet in a convention, to be held on the day of. next, at such place as shall be appointed by the secret committee of this society; and that the poe so elected do forthwith transmit to the secretary of this society, No. 9, Piccadilly, London, the vouchers of their several elections, in order that the place of meeting may be duly notified to them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8453 “ Resolved, That it is the right and the bounden duty of the people to punishall traitors against the nation, and that the followin, words are now not a part of the oath of allegiance; to wit, ‘I declare that it is not lawful, ‘upon any pretence whatever, to take arms against the king.’ 
GARROW 8454 You have been already examined
MRS_EVANS 8455 Yes. 
GARROW 8456 Were you a member of the London Corresponding Society 
MRS_EVANS 8457 Yes. 
GARROW 8458 And attended the division meetings 
MRS_EVANS 8459 Yes. 
GARROW 8460 Look at that paper [showing hima pepe); were papers of that sort distributed at the vision meeting of the society 
MRS_EVANS 8461 I never saw them distributed. 
GARROW 8462 Did you ever see them there; I saw one of them handed round at the division st Snow-hill. 
GARROW 8463 When 
MRS_EVANS 8464 I cannot justly say. 
GARROW 8465 About how long ago 
MRS_EVANS 8466 May be nine months ago now. 
GARROW 8467 Did you see more than one 
MRS_EVANS 8468 I never saw but that one. 
EYRE 8469 What mamber was that division? —The division that met at Scotney’s, the Three Tuns, on Snow-hill, I think No. 11. 
GIBBS 8470 Does your lordship think that without producing the paper itself, which was handed round, they can give in evidence a paper similar to it? 
EYRE 8471 If he can take upon himself to say that it is the same paper. 
EYRE 8472  Countrymen, you are told by those who are in office, that you arein danger of a Freoeb invasion. 
EYRE 8473 “You are told by those who are cat of office, that you are in danger of a Hessiaa ur Hanoverian invasion. 
EYRE 8474 “In either case arms will be of use to yous agree among yourselves, get arms, and the use of them ! 
GARROW 8475 Did you at any time find any pikes in the house of Orrock in Edinburgh
MRS_EVANS 8476 Yes; upon the evening of the 15th of May last I searched the house of Orrock. 
GARROW 8477 Did you find any pikes there? —Yes—to the amount of thirty-three, finished aud unfinished. 
GARROW 8478 ‘Those which you state to be finished, had blades and shafts] suppose
MRS_EVANS 8479 ‘They were nove of bein with shafts, there were only the blades. 
GARROW 8480 Did you find any in the possession of any other person
MRS_EVANS 8481 Upon the same day, in the house of Robert Watt, who was lately executed at Edinburgh, there were twelve found at ond search, and four at another. 
GARROW 8482 Were they likewise blades without shafts? 
GARROW 8483 —There was one shaft. 
GIBBS 8484 Does your lotdship think that this, which was all after the apprehension of the prisoner, is evidence? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8485 I mentioned hast night that I had proved the order to be given for them before the apprehension of the prifoner; the order by Watt and M‘Bwan. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8486 Mr. Gidts
MRS_EVANS 8487 Then that is all that you cam prove; ; ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8488 We have proved that Stock produced to Watt and Ross a printed circular ietter, signed Thomas Hardy, which is verbatim the same circular letter, a bandle of which was found in the possession of the prisoner; we have already proved that there was a conversation at that time, in which Watt desired that Stock would bring about a communication with Hardy ; we certainly have not proved that Stock brought about that communication ; but, I submit to your lordships, that if we prove the order for the pikes to have been given previous to that time, that the execution of that order follows naturally, and necessarily upon it. 
GARROW 8489 We submit to your lordships that it is evidence to go to the jury, that the pikes which were found in the possession of Watt, are those pikes which were made in execution of the order given by Watt to Orrock, antecedent to the apprehension of the prisoner. 
GIBBS 8490  It seems to me that upon the principle your lordships have laid down, that nothing which happened after the apprehension of the prisoner can be evidence against him; this evidence ought to be excluded: whether the evidence they have iven, previous to the apprehension, answers e purpose they wish, ts another thing; but some pikes having been ordered by Orrock, or Watt, before the apprehension of Mr. Hardy, does not make the finding of these pikes, after the apprehension df Hardy, evidence, any more than if no order whatever had been given for them previously: if the former evidence is not complete for the purpose for which they want it, [cannot conceive upon what principle the pikes being found in the possession of this man, after Mr. Hardy’s apprehension, is rendered evidence, by a circumstance which happened before it ; itwould not have been evidence supposing that communication had not taken place. 
EYRE 8491 It appears to me that there is a clear, satisfactory ground upon which the evidence must be received, at the same time that you would be at liberty to insist that the execution of the order afterwards does not personally affect the prisoner, but it is a circumstance in evidence to establish the truth of the evidence of the order that the things were found afterwards correspin with the ore 
GIBBS 8492 Your lordship sees, in arguin, this, that do not mean to admit that the order was Mr. Hardy’s, or any thing like it. 
EYRE 8493 Nor do I wish to Ee you to admit any such thing. 
EYRE 8494 Mr. Garrow to ‘Middleton, — Flow many did you find
MRS_EVANS 8495 In the first search I found. 
EYRE 8496 twelve blades without handles. 
EYRE 8497 What was it that led you to search Watt’s house 
MRS_EVANS 8498 The circumstance that carried me there was, there was a bankrupt had secreted Some goods in Watt's house; in searching es those effects I found these blades for 
EYRE 8499 8, : 
EYRE 8500 In what part of the house did you find them 
MRS_EVANS 8501 In the lower part of the house, in his dining room, as his maid called it; a locked-fast closet, or a locked-fast press. 
EYRE 8502 Did you deliver to Mr. Clerk, the sheriff of Edinburgh, those which you found in the house of Orrock, and those which you found in the house of Watt
MRS_EVANS 8503 They were brought to Sheriff Clerk’s office, and lodged there; there was one shaft found aleng with the four which were found at the second search. 
EYRE 8504 Were the shaft and the blade united, at the time you found them, or apart
MRS_EVANS 8505 They were not united; but there was a Mr. William Lockhart, sheriff Clerk’s depute, attended ; we tried one of the blades to the shaft, an they fitted exactly. 
EYRE 8506 ‘the manner in which they are attached is, I understand, by a screw 
MRS_EVANS 8507 Yes. 
EYRE 8508 Mr. Lockhart, you said, was with you
MRS_EVANS 8509 H e was present with me in the man’s house. 
EDWARDS 8510 I shall esteem it a favou if I may be permitted to say a few words to the jury, before I leave the court. 
EYRE 8511 To the Jury !— Or to your lordship. 
EYRE 8512 Is it to change any thing in the testimony you have given
MRS_EVANS 8513 Not to change, to explain. When I was examined the ni hit before last, Mr. Garrow was very particular in asking me if I received an address to a person at Sheffield from Mr. Hardy; it is true I received an address, and a meeting was to have taken place in GreenArbour-court; I wish to let the jury know that that meeting never did take place; no money was put down, and no letter was sent to Sheffield. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8514 Having mentioned this, I would ask, had you any talk with Hillier about the ale-house in Green-Arbourcourt
MRS_EVANS 8515 On the day that Hardy was taken into custody, Hillier and Gosling wete at our house, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8516 When did you first see Hillier’s pike? 
EYRE 8517 This leads to 4 cross-examination. A witness desires to exlain a circumstance in his evidence; I should ery unwilling to introduce a new examination. 
GARROW 8518 Does not your lordship think it fit to inquire whom he has talked to since he was examined? 
EYRE 8519 No; I do not think it necessary; his explanation seems a fair one, to prevent any misinterpretation of his evidence. 
EYRE 8520 Mr. Attorney General:'—If a witness is to come afterwards, in this way, to explain his evidence, his not stating this in his original examination cuts out a great number of material questions. 
EYRE 8521 I perfectly with you; this explanation ought to be relave with abundant caution by the jury; and from another circumstance, the sort o practice we have got-into, of any man’s printing such accounts as his industry may collect in court, is certainly a very inconvenient practice, because it may lead to conversations with witnesses, and may induce these explanations. The jury will understand that the explanation is made in that situation of things, and theywill form their own judgment upon it. Yet still,Ithink, it should rest with the esplanation that the witness desires to offer. 
GARROW 8522 You are what they call sheriff Clerk’s depute, in the city of Edinburgh 
MRS_EVANS 8523 Yes. 
GARROW 8524 Did you go with Middleton to the house of Orrock 
MRS_EVANS 8525 No; to Watt’s house. 
GARROW 8526 Were you present at the finding of any blades for pikes at Watt’s honse 
MRS_EVANS 8527 Yes. 
GARROW 8528 How many did you find upon the first search 
MRS_EVANS 8529 Twelve. 
GARROW 8530 Where were they
MRS_EVANS 8531 In a locked up press in his dining-room. 
GARROW 8532 How soon did you renew your search
MRS_EVANS 8533 One happened between eight and nine o’clock, the other between twelve and one. 
GARROW 8534 How many did you find at the second search 
MRS_EVANS 8535 Two pike-heads. 
GARROW 8536 Blades
MRS_EVANS 8537 Yes; and two battle-axes, and a 
GARROW 8538 Pend you make any trial whether the blades and the pole as you call it, would fit each sother
MRS_EVANS 8539 Yes. 
GARROW 8540 Where is the pole
MRS_EVANS 8541 It is here. [The witness produced it.] 
GARROW 8542 Where did you deposit the several things that you found at Watt’s house 
MRS_EVANS 8543 At Mr. Sheriff Clerk’s. 
GARROW 8544 I believe you are sheriff of Edinburgh 
MRS_EVANS 8545 Yes. 
GARROW 8546 Was that box, and the thing the witness calls the pole, deposited in your care as sheriff
MRS_EVANS 8547 The pikes, he mentions, were deposited in my care; they were in a locked-up pine of mine froin the time that they were found till the trials at Edinburgh ; when they were carried down to be shown at the trials, they were committed to the witness, who was to produce them. 
GARROW 8548 Except then when they were delivered to Lockhart, they have been constantly locked wp under your care 
MRS_EVANS 8549 Yes, they have. 
GARROW 8550 Did you return these to the sheriff, which you had from him, after the Edinburgh trials
LOCKHART 8551 No; I have kept them in my custody ever since. 
GARROW 8552 And are these the same the sheriff delivered to you 
LOCKHART 8553 They are. 
GARROW 8554 Is Stock still living at Edinburgh, or has he absconded
CLERK 8555 We av made every search possible to apprehend him, but without success. 
GARROW 8556 Open the box, and take out some of those blades. [Mr. Lockhart opened the-box.] 
GARROW 8557 Is that what you call the battle-axe 
CLERK 8558 It is. [The witness screwed it ona shail} 
GARROW 8559 Ilave you got any other sort of blades there
CLERK 8560 Yes. [The witness produced some pike-blades, shaped like a bayonet, unscrewed the battle-axe, and screwed on a pike in its stead.] 
GARROW 8561 You Vain to me, in taking one of these blades out, to screw off something—what is that
CLERK 8562 When that is screwed off, it is rendered fit to attach to the pole; when that is on, it forms a handle; so that it may be used without a pole. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8563 Martin, in his letter to Margarot, in Scotland, says, Gay will tell you more than I dare mention. I am going to read the account of Gay’s being admitted a member of the Constitutional Society; he was proposed by Mr. Tooke, and seconded by Mr. Bonney.

MR_EVANS 8579 I do not. I think I should know if I heard it mentioned, because I have heard it mentioned several times. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8580 Was it Duke-street 
MR_EVANS 8581 I believe it was near St. James's; he used to be with Martin every day. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8582 My Lord, I hav now finished the evidence on the part of the prosecution. 
ERSKINE 8583 Gentlemen of the Jury, Before I proceed to the performance of the momentous duty which is atlength cast upon me, I desire in the first place to return my thanks to the Judges, for the indulgence I have received in the opportunity of addressing you at this later period of the day, than the ordinary sitting of the Court; when IJ have had the refreshment which nature but too much required, and a few hours retirement, to arrange a little in my mind that immense matter, the result of which I must now endeavour to lay before you
MR_EVANS 8584 I have to thank you also, gentlemen, for the very condescending and obliging manner in which you so readily consented to this accommodation : the Court could only speak for itself, referring me to you, whose rest and comforts had been so long interrupted. I shall always remember your kindness. 
ERSKINE 8585 Before I advance to the regular consideration of this great cause, either as it regards the evidence or the law, I wish first to put aside all that I find in the speech of my learned friend, the attorney general, which is either collateral to the merits, or in which I can agree with him. First then, tv THE NAME OP THE PRISONER, and speaking Ais sentiments, which are well known to be my own also, I concur in the eulogium which you have heard upon the constitution of our wise furefathers. But before this eulogium can have any just or useful application, we ought to reflect upon shat it is which entitles this Constitution to the praise so justly bestowed upon it. To say nothing at present of its most essential excellence, or rather the very soul of it, viz. the share the people ought to have in their government, by a pure representation, for the assertion of which the Prisoner stands arraigned asa traitor before you,—what is it that 
ERSKINE 8586 “ I have been indulged by Mr. Rogers, the celebrated author of the Pleasures of Memory and other poems, with Mr. Horne Tooke’s copy of Hardy’s trial, where I find in Mr. Tooke’s hand-writing at the end of this argument, the following remarkable note: ‘Tus SPEECH WILL LIVE FOR EVEB. 
ERSKINE 8587 distinguishes the government of England from the most despotic monarchies? What— but the security which the subject enjoys in a trial and judgment by. his equals; rendered doubly secure as being part of a system of law which no expediency can warp, and which no power can abuse with impunity ? 
ERSKINE 8588 To the Attorney General’s second prelimihay observation, I equally agree
MR_EVANS 8589 I anxiously wish with him that you shall bear in memory the anarchy which is desolating France.— Before I sit down, I may perhaps, in my turn, have occasion to reflect’ a little upon its probable causes; but waiting a season for such reflections, let us first consider what the evil is which has been so feelingly lamented, as having fallen on that unhappy country.—It is, that under the dominion of a barbarous state necessity, every protection of law is abrogated and destroyed; it is, that no man can say, under such a system of alarm and terror, that his life, his liberty, his reputation, or any one human blessing, is secure to him fora moment: it is, that, if accused of federalism, or moderatism, or incivism, or of whatever else the change fashions and factions of the day shall have lifted up into high treason against the State, he must see his friends, his family, and the light of heaven, no more : the accusation and the sentence being the same: following one another as the thunder pursues the flash. Such has been the state of England,—such is the state of France: and how then, since they are introduced to you for application, ought they in reason and sobriety to. be applied? If this prosecution has been commenced (as is asserted) to avert from Great Britain the calamities incident to civil confusion, leading in its issues to the deplorable condition of France ; I call upon you, gentlemen, to avert such calamity from fall ing upon my client, and through his side upon yourselves and upon our country.—Let not him suffer under vague expositions of tyrannical laws, more tyrannically executed.—Let not him be hurried away to pre-doomed-execution, from an honest enthusiasm for the public safety.—I ask for hima trial by this applauded constitution of our country : I call upon you to administer the law to him, according to our own wholesome institutions, by its strict and rigid letter. However you may eventually disapprove of any part of his conduct, or viewing it through a false medium, may think it even wicked, I claim for him, as a subject of England, that the law shall decide upon its criminal denomination : I protest, in his name, against all appeals to speculations concerning consequences, when the law commands us to look only to vtentions.—If the state be threatened with evils, let parliament administer a prospective remedy, but let the prisoner hold his life uNDER THE Law. Gentlemen, I ask this solemnly of the Court, whose Justice I am persuaded will afford it to me; I ask it more emphatically of you, the jury, who are called upon your oaths to make a true deliverance of your countryman, from this Pele : but lastly, and chiefly, I implore it of aim in whose hands are all the issues of life; whose humane and merciful eye expands itself over all the transactions of mankind; at whose command nations rise, and fall, and are regenerated ; without whom nota sparrow falleth to the ground ; —I implore it of God himself, that He will fill your minds with the spirit of, justice and of truth ; so that you may be able to find your way through the labyrinth of matter laid before you, a labyrinth in which no man’s life was ever before involved, in the annals of British trial, nor indeed in the whole history of human justice or injustice. 
ERSKINE 8590 Gentlemen, the first thing in order, is to look at the indictment itself; of the whole of which, or of some integral part, the prisoner must be found guilty, or be wholly discharged from guilt. 
ERSKINE 8591 The indictment charges that the prisoners did’ maliciously and traitorously conspire, compass, and imagine, to bring and put our lord the king to death ; and that to fulfil, perfect, and bring to effect, their most evil and wicked purpose (that is to suy, of bringing and putting the king to death), “they met, conspired, consulted, and agreed amongst themselves, and other false traitors unknown, to cause and procure a convention to be assemr bled within the kingdom, WITH INTENT— (Lam reading the very words of the indictment, which I entreat you to follow in the notes you have been taking with such honest perseverance)—“ WITH INTENT, AND IN ORDER that the persons so assembled at such convention, should and might traitor ously, and in defiance of the authority, and ast the will of Parliament, subvert and 
ERSKINE 8592 ‘er, and cause to be subverted and altered, the legislature, rule, and government of the country, and to depase king from the royal. state, Ute, power, and government thereof. This is the first and great leading overt act in the indictment; and you observe that it js not charged as being treaSOD SUBSTANTIVELY AND IN ITSELF; but only ag itis committed in pursuance of the treason against the king’s Penson, antecedently imputed; for the charge is nor, that the prisoners conspired to assemble a convention to nerose the king, but that they. conspired and compassed his peatH; and that, in order to accomplish that wicked and detestable purpose, i. ¢, in order to fulfil the traitorous intention of the mind against his LiFe, they conspired to assemble aconvention, with a view to depose him. The same ol tion applies alike to all the other counts or overt ais upon the record, which manifestly indeed ah supors te yay cise shetaes elr sup, because t lication of different writings, and provision of arms, not as distinct offences, but. as acts done to excite ta. the assembling of the same convention, and te meintain it: when assem, 
ERSKINE 8593 Hees but sot nll anid sehen sent se he forgotten, use they also un! ly charge sie different acts as committed in fulfilment of the same traitorous purpose, To BRING THE xInG ‘To pEaTH. You will therefore have three distinct matters for consideration, upon this trial: First, What share (if any) the prsoner had, in concert with others, in assembling any convention or meeting of subjects within this eingsom : Secondly, What were the acts to be done by this convention, when assem Hledsan a a Thirdly, Yibat was deve, purpose, and intention of those who projected its, existence, This third iderati indeed, comprehends, or rather precedes and swallows up the other two ; because, before it can be material to decide upon the views of the convention, as pointed to the subversion of the rale and order of the king’s political authority (even if such views could be ascribed to it, and brought home even personally to ae meat ‘aa shall have to cenit whe ther that crimina).conspiracy, against the established order of the community, was hatched and; engendered by a wicked. contemplation to destroy the natural life and person of the king, and whether the acts and established by the evidence, were done ia pursuance and in fulfilment of the same traitor ous purpose, Gentlemen, this view of the subject is not only correct, but self evident
MR_EVANS 8594 The subversion of the King’s political government, and all, conspiracies to subvert it, are crimes of po magnitude and enormity, which the law is open tq punish; bu¢ neither of them ore the crimes before you.—The prisoner is xor charged with a conspiracy against the King’s POLITICAL GOVERNMENT, but against his sa TURAL L1FB, He is not. accused of having merely taken sepa te depose him from hisauthority, but with having done so with theinter tion te bring him to death.—It is the act with the specific intention, and not the act alone, which constitutes a charge.—The act ‘a cqnspiring to depose the King, indeed evidence, according to cirousastaces, of an intention to destroy his natural existence, but never, as a proposition of aw, can const tute the intention itself—Where an act done in pursuance of an intention, surely the intention must first-exist; a man cannot dos thing in fulfilment of an intention, unless his mind. first conceives that intention.—Th ing an act, or the pursuit of a system of conduct, which leads in probable consequences to the death of the King, may legally (if 0 such be. hefore you) affect the consideration of the traitorous perpoes raid questions quences unconnected even with intention or consciousness, shall be synonymous in law with the traitorous mind; although the traitorous mind alone is arraigned, as constituting the crime. 
ERSKINE 8595 Gentlemen, the first question consequently for consideration, and to which I must therefore earnestly implore the attention of the Court, is this: WHAT IS THE LAW UPON THIS MOMENTOUS SUBJECT? And recollecting that Iam invested with no authority, I shall not presume to offer you any thing of my own ; nothing shall proceed from myself upon this part of the inquiry, but that which is merely introductory, and necessary to the understanding of the authorities on which I mean to rely for the establishment of doctrines, not less essential to the general liberties of England, than to the particular Sonsivertcn which constitutes our present uty. 
ERSKINE 8596 First then, I maintain that that branch of the statute 95th of Edward Srd, which declares it to be high treason “ when a man doth compass or imagine the death of the King, of his lady the Queen, or of his eldest son and heir, was intended to guard by a higher sanction than felony, the Naturat tives of the King, Queen, and Prince ; and that no act, therefore (cither inchoate or consummate), of resistance to, or rebellion ugainst, the King’s regal capucity, amounts to high treason of compassing his death, unless where they can be charged upon the indictment, and proved to the satisfaction of the Jury at the trial, as overt acts, committed by the prisoner, in fulSilment of a traitorous intention to destroy the King’s NaTuRAL LIFE. 
ERSKINE 8597 Secondly, that the compassing the King’s death, or, in other words, the traitorous intention to destroy his natural existence, is the treason, and not the overt acts, which are only laid as manifestations of the traitorous intention, or, in other words, a3 EVIDENCE competent to be left to a Jury to prove it; and that no conspiracy to levy war aguinst the King, nor any conspiracy against his regal character or capacity, is a good overt act of cempassing Ais death, unless some force be exerted, or in contemplation against tr Krno’s Person: and that such force so exerted or in contemplation, is not substantively the treason of compassing, but only competent in point of law to establish it, if the Jury, by the verdict of Guilty, draw that conclusion of fact from the evidence of the overt act. 
ERSKINE 8598 Thirdly, that the charge in the Indictment, of compassing the King’s death, is not laid as legal inducement or introduction, to follow as a legal inference from the establishment of the overt act, but is laid as an averment of a Fact; and, as such, the very gist of the Indictment, to be affirmed or negatived by the verdict of Guilty or Not Guilty. It will not (iam persuaded) be suspected by the Attorney General, or by the Court, that Iam about to support these doctrines by oppusing my een are a a aremeetieie tee own putgarent to the authoritative writings of the venerable and excellent lord Hale, whose memory will live in this country, and pete the enlightened world, as long as the administration of pure justice shall exist : neither do I wish to oppose any thing which is to be found in the other learned authorities principally relied upon by the Crown, because all my positions are perfectly consistent with a right interpretation of them ; and because, even were it otherwise, I could not expect successfully to oppose them by any reasonings of my own, which can have no weight, but as they shall be found at once consistent with acknowledged authorities, and with the established principles of the English law
MR_EVANS 8599 I can do this with the greater security, because my respectable and learned friend, the Attorney General, has not cited cases which have been the disgrace of this country in former times, nor asked you to sanction by your judgment those bloody murders, which are recorded by them as acts of English justice; but, as might be expected of an honourable man, his expositions of the law (though I think them frequently erroneous) are drawn from the same sources, to which I look up for doctrines so very different. I find, indeed, throughout the whole range of authorities (mean those which the attorney general has properly considered as deserving that name and character) very little contradiction; for, as far as I can discover, much more entanglement has arisen from now and then a tripping in the expression, than from any difference of sentiment amongst eminent and virtuous judges, who have either examined, or sat in judgment upon this momentous subject. 
ERSKINE 8600 Gentlemen, before I purste the course T have prescribed to myself, I desire most distinctly to be understood, that in my own opinion the most successful argument, that a conspiracy to ag the king does not necessarily establish the treason charged upon this record, 1s TOTALLY RESIDE ANY POSSIBLE JYUDGMENT THAT YOU CAN HAVE TO FORM UPON THE EVIDENCE BEFORE YOU; since throughout the whole volumes that have been read, I can trace nothing that even points to the imagination of such a conspiracy; and consequently the doctrines of Coke, Male, and Foster, on the subject of high treason, might equally be detailed in any other trial that has ever been proceeded upon in this place. But, gentlemen, I stand in a fearful and delicate situation
MR_EVANS 8601 As a suppesed attack upon the king’s civil authority has been transmuted, by construction, into a murderous conspiracy against his natural person ; in the same manner, and by the same arguments, a conspiracy to overturn that civil authority, by direct force, has again been assimilated, by farther construction, to a design to undermine monarchy by changes wrought through public opinion, enlarging gradually into untversal will; so that Ican adinit no false proposition, however wide I may think it of rational application.—For as there is a conSTRUCTIVE COMPaSsING, so also there is a CONSTRUCTIVE DEPosING ; and I cannot, therefore, possibly know what either of them is separately, nor how the one may be argued to involve the other.—There are, besides, many risoners, whose cases are behind, and whose Tees may be involved in your present deliberation ; their names have been already stigmatized, and their conduct arraigned in the evidence you have heard, as a part of’ the conirucy.—It is these considerations which rive me into so large a field of argument, because, by sufficiently ascertaining the law in the outset, they who are yet looking up to it Pr protection, may not be brought into eril. a gentlemen, I now proceed to establish, that a compassing of the death of the king, within the twenty-fifth of Edward the third, which is the charge against the prisoner, consists in a traitorous intention against his NATURAL Lire; and that nothing short of your firm belief of that detestable intention, from overt acts which you find him to have committed, can justify his conviction. That I may keep my word with you in building my argument upon nothing of my own, I hope my friend Mr. Gibbs will have the goodness to call me back, if he finds me wanderin; from my engagement; that I ma: ineded step by step upon the most venerable and acknowledged authorities of the law. 
ERSKINE 8602 In this process I shall begin with lord Hale, who opens this important subject by stating the reason of passing the statute of the twenty-fifth of Edward the third, on which the indictment is founded
MR_EVANS 8603 Lord Hale says, in his Pleas of the Crown, vol. i. page 82, that “ at common law there was a great lutitude sed in raising offences to the crime and punishment of treason, by way of interpretation and arbitrary construction, which brought in great uncertainty and confusion. Thus accroaching, i, . ENCROACHING ON ROYAL POWER was an usual charge of treason anciently, though a very uncertain charge; so that no man could tell what it was, or what defence to make to it. Lord Hale then goes on to state various instances of vexation and cruelty, and concludes with this striking observation : “ by these and the like instances that might be given, it appears how ARBITRARY AND UNCERTAIN the law of treason wus before the statute of 25th of Edward the IIIrd, whereby it came to pass that almost every offence that was, or seemed to be, a breach of the faith and allegiance due to the king, was 
ERSKINE 8604 CONSTRUCTION, CONSEQUENCE, and INTERPRETATION, faised into the offence of high treason. This is the lamentation of the great Hale upon the state of this country previous to the passing of the statute, which, he says, ‘was passed as 4 REMEDIAL law, to put an end to them; and Lord Coke, considering it in the same light, says, in his third Institute, page 2nd, “ the parliament which passed this statute was called (as it well deserved) parliomenta benedictum ; and the like honour was given to it by the different statutes which from tim to time brought back treasons to its standart, all agreeing in magnifying and extolling thi blessed Act
MR_EVANS 8605 Now this statute, which bs obtained the: panegyric of these great mer, whom the Chief Justice in his Charge looked up to for light and fur example, and wha the Attorney General takes also for his guide, would very little have deserved the hig) eulogium bestowed upon it, if, though avovedly passed to destroy uncertainty in crimim! justice, and to beat down the arbitrary constructions of Judges, lamented by Hale, asdifiguring and dishonouring the law, 4t had, vertheless, been so worded as to give birth new constructions and uncertainties, inste:! of destroying the old ones.—It would bul have entitled itself to the denomination of s blessed statute, if it had not, in its enacting letter, which professed to remove doubts, ate to ascertain the law, made use of expressions the best known and understood; and it wll be found accordingly, that it cautiously did It will be found, that, in selecting the expresion of coMPASSING THE DEATH, it employeda term of the most fixed and ne cation in the language of English law, which not only no judge or counsel, but which attorney or attorney’s clerk, could misunderstand; because in former ages, before the statute, compassing the death of any mar had been a felony, and what had amounted 0 such compassing, had been settled in a thousen instances. To establish this, and to show also, by no reasoning of mine, that the term “ compassing the death was intended by the statute, when applied to the King, as higi treason, to have the same signification asit had obtained in the law when applied to the subject as a felony, I shall refer to Mr. Justice Foster, and even to a passage cited by the Attorney General himself, which speaks unequal and unanswerably for itself, 3 to mock all ,commentary.—“ The ancieal writers, says Foster, “ in treating of felonums homicide, considered the felonious INTENTION manifested by plain facts, in the same light, point of guilt, as homicide itself. —The rule ras. VOLUNTAS REPUTATUR PRO Facto; and hile this rule prevailed, the nature of the offence 2 expressed by the term COMPASSING THE DEATH. This rule has been long laid aside as too rigorms in the case of common persons ; but in the cax of the Kinc, Queen, and Prince, the statute of treasons has, with great propricty, RETAINtD in its full extent and vigour ; and in describing the offence, has likewise RETAINED the ancient mode of expression, when a man doth compass imagine the death of our lord the king, ¢. and thereof be upon sufficient proof, procablemesl, attainted of open decd, by people of his condition: the words of the statute descriptive of the ofentt, must, THEREFORY, 6¢ strictly pursued in cvry indictment for this species of treason.—It MUST charge that the defendant did traitorously cot and imagine the king’s death ; and then go Seand charge the several acts made use of by the prisoner to effectuate his trattorous purpose; YOR THE COMPASSING THE KING’S DEATH ISTHE treason, and the overt acts are charged as the means made use of to effectuate the intentions and imaginations of the heart ; and therefore, in the case of the regicides, the indictment charged that they did traiturously compass and imagine the death of the king, and the cutting off the head wus laid as the overt act, and the person who was supposed to have given the mortal aroke was convicted on the same indictment. This concluding instance, though at first view it may appear ridiculous, is well selected as an illustration; because, though in that case there could be no possible doubt of the intention, since the act of a deliberate execution involves, in common sense, the intention to destroy life, yet still the anomaly of the offence, which exists wholly in the rNTENTION, and not in the overt act, required the preservation of the form of the indictment.—It is surely impossible to read this commentary of Foster, without seeing the true purpose of the statute: the common law had anciently considered, even in the case of a fellow-subject, the malignant intention to destroy, as equivalent to the act itself; but that noble spirit of humanity which pervades the whole system of our jurisprudence, had, before the time of king Edward the third, eat out and destroyed this rule, too rigorous in its general application; but, as Foster truly observes in the passage I have read—“ This rule, too rigorous inthe case of the subject, the statute of treasons RETAINED in the case of the king, and RETAINED ALSO THE VERY EXPRESSION used by the law when compassing the death of a subJect was felony. 
ERSKINE 8606 The statute, therefore, being expressly made remove doubts; and accurately to define treason, adopted the ancient expression of the common law, as applicable to felonious homicide, meaning that the life of the sovereign 
ERSKINE 8607 Id remain an exception, and that vorun
ERSKINE 8608 Tas PRo Facro, the wicked intention for the deed itself (as it regarded his sacred life), should continue for the rule: and, therefore, says Foster, the statute meaning to RETAIN the law which was before general, RETAINED also the expression. It appears to me, therefore, incontrovertible, not only by the words of the statute itself, but upon the authority of Foster, which I shall follow up by that of lord Coke and Hale, contradicted by no sylle in their works, as I shall demonstrate, that the statute, as it regarded the security of king’s tirz, did not mean to enact a new security never known to the common law in other cases, but meant to suffer a common law rule which formerly existed universally, which was precisely known, but which was too severe in common cases, to remain as an copton in favour of the king’s security —I do therefore positively maintain, NoT aS AN ADVOCATE MERELY, but IN MY OWN PERSON, 
ERSKINE 8609 that, within the letter and meaning of the statute, nothing can be a compassing the death of the king that would not, in ancient times, have been a felony in the case of a subject; for otherwise Foster and Coke, as will be seen, are very incorrect when they say the statute reTarnep the old law, and the appropriate word to express it; for if it went BEYOND IT, it would, on the contrary, have been a newrule unknown to the common law, enacted, for the first time, for the preservation of the king’s life. Unquestionably the legislature might have made such a rule; but we are not inquiring what it mixit have enacted, but what it Aas enacted. But I ought to ask pardon for having relapsed into any argument of my own upon this subject, when the authorities are more express to the purpose than any language I can use; for Mr. Justice Foster bimee f expressly says, Discourse descriptive of the offence, viz. ‘if a man doth compass or imagine, and thereof be attainted of open deed, are plainly borrowed from the common law, and therefore must bear the same construction they did at common law.—Is this distinct 
MR_EVANS 8610 I will read it to you again: “ all the words descriptive of the offence, viz. ‘ if a “man doth compass or imagine, and thereof be attainted of open deed, are plainly borrowed Jrom the common law, and therefore must bear the same construction they did at common law. Gentlemen, Mr. Justice Foster is by no means singular in this doctrine.—Lord Coke, the oracle of the law, and the best oracle one can consult, when standing for a prisoner charged with treason, as he was the highest prerogative lawyer that ever existed, maintains the same doctrine—even He, even Coke, the infamous prosecutor of Raleigh, whose character with posterity, as an attorney general, my worthy and honourable friend would disdain to hold, to be author of all his valuable works ; yet even this very lord Coke himself, holds precisely the same language with Foster.— For, in ie commentary on this statute, in his third Institute, p. 5, when he comes to the word, “ porn compass, he says, “ Let us see first what the compassing the death of a sub secT was before the making of this statute, when voluntas reputabatur pro facto.—Now what is the plain English of this?—The commentator says, I am going to instruct you, the student, who are to learn from me the law of England, what is a compassing of the death of the Kine; but that I cannot do, but by first carrying you to look into what was the compassing of the death of a sussect at the ancient common law ; because the statute having made a compassing, as applied to the Kino, the crime of high treason, which, at common law, was felony in the case of a suB-sect, it is impossible to-define the one, without looking back to the records which illustrate the orneR.—This is so directly the train of Lord Coke's reasoning, that in his own sin-gularly precise style of commentating, he immediately lays betore his reader a variety ofinstances from the ancient records and year-books, of compassing the susscct’s DLATH; and what are they ?—Not acts wholly collateral to attacks upon life, dogmatically laid ; down by the law trom speculations upon pro-bable or possible consequences; but assaults : WITH INTENT TO MURDER; conspiracies to waylay the person with the saME INTENTION; and other MuRpERoUs muchinations,—These were the only compassings before the statute, against the subject’s life; and the extension of the expression was never heard of in theJaw till introduced by the craft of political ; judges, when it became applicable to crimesagainst tue Srate.—Lere again I desire toappeal to the highest authorities for this source of constructive treasons; for although : the statute of Edward urd had expressly directed that nothing should be doclapel to be treason but cases within its enacting letter, yet lurd Hale says, in his Pleas of the Cruwn, page 83, that “ dings were so carried by PaRrTIFS aud FACTIONS, in the succeeding reign of Richard 2nd, thue this statute was but little observed, but as this or that party got the better. —So the crime of high treason was in a manner arbitrarily unposed und adjudged, to the disudpantace of the party that was to be judged ; which, by vartous vicissitudes and revolutions, mischicfed all parties first and lust, and left a reat unsetiledness and unquictness in the minds Of the people, and was one of the occasions vf the unhappiness of that King. 
ERSKINE 8611 “ All this mischief was produced by the sta“te of the Qist uf Richard 2nd, which enacted, L.. ‘every man that compusseth or pursueth the of the King, on To DEPOSE HIM, OR TO RENDER UP HIS HOMAGE LIEGE, or he that raiscth people, and rideth against the King, to make war within kis realm, and of that be nvty altainted and adjudged, shall be adjudged a traitor, of high treason against the crown, 
ERSKINE 8612 “ This, says lord Hale, “ was a great snare to the subject, insomuck that the statute 1st of Henry 4th, which repealed it, recited that no man knew how he ought to behave himself, to do, speak, or say, for doubt of such puins of treason: and therefore, wholly to remove the prejudice, which might come tothe king’s subjects, the statute 1st of Henry 4th chap. 10, was made WHICH BROUGHT BaCK TREASON TO THE STANDARD or THE 25TH OF Epwarp Srp. 
ERSKINE 8613 Now if we look to this statute of Richard 2nd, which produced such mischiefs—what are they 
MR_EVANS 8614 As far asit re-cnacted the treason of compassing the King’s death, and levying war, it only re-cuacted the statute of Edward Srd, but it went beyond it by the loose construction of compassing to depose the King, and raising the people, and riding to make war, or acompassing to depose him, Terms NEW TO THE COMMON Law. The actual levying of force, to imprison or depose the King, was already and properly high treason, within the second branch of the statute; but this statute of Richard 2nd enlarged only the crime of compussing, making it extend to acompassing to imprison or depose, which are the great objects of an actual levying of war, and mak-. 
ERSKINE 8615 ing a compassing to levy war, on a footing with the actual levying it
MR_EVANS 8616 It seems, therefore most astonishing, that any judge could be supposed to have decided, as an abstract rule of daw, that a compassing to imprison or depose the king was high treason, sunstasTIVELY, WITHOUT PREVIOUS COMPASSING OP HIS DEATH: since it was made so by this statute, 21st of Richard 2nd, and reprobated, stigmatized, and repealed by the statute 1st of Henry 4th, chap. 10. “ And so little effect, says Mr. Justice Blackstone, “ have over-violent laws to prevent any crime, that within two years after this new luw of treason respecting imprisonment and deposing, this very prince wes both deposed and murdered. 
ERSKINE 8617 Gentlemen, this distinction, made by the humane statute of Edward 3rd, between treason against the king’s natural life, andrebellion against his civil authority, and winch the act of Richard 2nd, for a season, bruke down, is founded in wise and sound policy. successtul attack may be made upon the king's person by the malignity of an individual, wi out the combination of extended conspiracy, or the exertions of rebellious force; the law therefore justly stands upon the watch to crush the first overt manifestation of so evil and detestable a purpose—Considering the life of the chief magistrate as infinitely important tothe public security, it does not wait for the possible consummation of a crime, which requires neither time, combination, nor force to accomplish, but considers the traitor. ous purpose as a consummated treason: but the wise and humane policy of our foretathers extended the severity of the rule, coluntas pro facto, no farther than they were thus impelled and justified by the necessity; and therefore an intention to levy war and rebellion, not consummated, however manifested by the most overt acts of conspiracy, was not declared to be treason, and upon the plainest pricciple in the world ; the king’s rEGaL capacity, guarded by all the force and authority of the state, could not like his NatuRAL existence, be overthrown or endangered in a moment, by the first machinations of the traitorous mind of an individual, or even by the unarmed conspiracy of numbers; and therefore this humane and exalted institution, measuring the sanctions of criminal justice by the standard of civil necessity, thought it sufficient to scourge and dissipate unarmed conspirators by a less vindictive proceeding. 
ERSKINE 8618 These new treasons were, however, st. length all happily swept away on the accession of king Henry 4th, which brought the law back to the standard of Edward srd ;and, indeed, in reviewing the history of this highly favoured island, it is most beautiful, and, at the same time, highly encouraging to observe, by what an extraordinary concurrence of circumstances, under the superintendence of ay benevolent Providence, the liberties of our country have been established
MR_EVANS 8619 Amidst the convulsions, arising from the maddest ambition and injustice, and whilst the state was alternately departing from its poise, on one side, and on the other, the great rights of mankind were still insensibly taking root and flourishing ; — though sometimes monarch threatened to lay them prostrate, thoug! aristocracy occasionally undermined them, and democracy, in her turn, rashly trampled on them, yet they have ever come safely round at last.—This awful and sublime contemplation should teach us to bear with one another when our opinions do not quite coincide; extracting final harmony from the inevitable differences which ever did, and ever must exist amongst men. 
ERSKINE 8620 Gentlemen, the act of Henry 4th was scarcely made when it shared the same fate with the vencrable law which it restored. — Nobody regarded it
MR_EVANS 8621 It was borne down by factions, and, in those days, there were no judges, as there are now, to hold firm the baJance of justice amidst the storms of state, men could not then, as the prisoner can today, look up for protection to magistrates independent of the crown, and awfully accountable in character to an enlightened world.— As fast as arbitrary constructions were abolished by one statute, unprincipled judges began to build them up again, till they were beat down by another: to recount their strange treasons would be tiresome and disgusting; but their system of construction, in the teeth of positive law, may be well illustrated by two lines from Pope. 
ERSKINE 8622 “ Destroy his fib and sophistry, in vain, «« The creature's at his dirty work again. 
ERSKINE 8623 This system, both judicial and parliamentary, became indeed so intolerable, in the and repeal all, but only such as ure specified and expressed in this statute of Edward 8rd. By which law the safety of both the King and of the subject, and the prescrcation of the common weal, were wisely and sufficiently provided for, and in such certuinty, that nihil relictum est arbitrio judicis. The whole evil, indeed, to be remedied and avoided by the act of Queen Mary was, the arsitnium Jupicts, or judicial construction beyond the Letrer of the statute. The statute itself was perfect, and was restored in its full vigour; and to suppose, therefore, that when an act was expressly made, because judges had built treasons by constructions beyond the law, they were to be left, consistently with their duty, to go on building acarn, is to impute a folly to the legislature, which never yet was imputed to the framers of this admirable statute. But this absurd idea is expressly excluded, not merely by the statute, according to its’ plain interpretation, but according to the direct authority of lord Coke himself, in his commentary upon it. For he goes on to say, “ Two things are to be observed ; first, that the word EXPRESSED, in the statute of Maury, excludes all IMPLICATIONS OR INFERENCES WHAT SOEVER; secondly, that no former attainder, judgment, precedent, resolution, or opinion of judges, or justices, of high treason, other than such as are specified and expressed in the statute of Edward 3rd, are to be followed or drawn into example—For the words be plain and direct ; that from henceforth no act, deed, or offence shall be taken, hud, deemed or adjudged to be high treason, but only such as are declared and expressed in the suid act of the 25th of Edward 3rd, any act of parliament or statute ufter 25th of Edward 3rd, or any other declaration or matter, to the contrary notwithstanding. 
ERSKINE 8624 Gentlemen, if the letter of the statute of Mary, when coupled with lord Coke's commentary, required farther illustration, it would amply receive it from the pRrAMBLE, which interval between the reign of Henry 4th,| ought to be engraved on the heart of every and that of Philip and Mary, that it produced, man who loves the king, or who is called to in the first year of the latter reign, the most remarkable statute that ever passed in England, repealing not only all former statutes upon the subjcct, except that of Edward Srd, but also stigmatizing, upon the records of Parliament, the arbitrary constructions of Judges, and limiting them, in all times, to every LETTER of the statute. I will read to you lord Coke’s commentary upon the subject. In his third Institute, page 23, he says, “ Before the act of the 25th of Edward 
ERSKINE 8625 3rd, so many treasons had been made and declared, and in such sort penned, as not only the ignorant und unlearned people, but also learned and cxrpert men, were trapped and snared. Thus the great mischief before Edward 3rd, of the uncertainty of what was treason and what not, became so frequent and dangerous, as that the safest and surest remedy was by this excellent act of Mary to abrogate t any share in his councils; for, as lord Coke observes, in the same commentary : it truly recites, that “ the state of a king stundeth and consisteth more assured by the love und favour of the subjects towards their Suvercign, than in the dread and feurs of laws, made with rigorous and extreme punishment ; and that luws, justl made for the preservation of the common weal, without extreme punishment or penalty, are more often and for the most part better kept and obeyed, thun laws and statutes made with extreme punishment. 
ERSKINE 8626 But, gentlemen, the most important part of lord Coke’s commentary on this statute is’ yet behind, which I shall presently read to. you, and to which I implore your most earnest attention; because I will show yout by it, that the unfortunate man, whose innocence I am defending, is arraigned before you of high treason, upon evidence not only wholly repugnant to this particular statute, in trials for other crimes, on the contrary, the but such as never yet was heard of in Englandlegislature did not even leave it to the ju upon any capital trial:, evroence which, even with all the attention you have given to it, I defy any one of you, at this moment, to say of what it consists ; evipence, which (since -itmust be called by that name) I tremble for my boldness in presuming to stand up for the life of a man, when I am conscious that I am incapable of understanding from it, even what acts are imputed to him ; pencr, which has consumed four days in the reading ; not in reading the acts of the prisoncr, but the unconnected writings of men, unknown to one another, upon a hundred different subjects; evipence, the very listening to which has deprived me of the sleep which nature requires; which has filled my mind with See ig distress and agitation, and which, from its discordant unconnected nature, has suffered me to reap no advantage from the indulgence, which I began with thanking you for; but which, on the contrary, has almost set my brain on fire, with the vain endeavour of collecting my thoughts upon a ee never designed for any rational course of thinking. 
ERSKINE 8627 Let us, therefore, see how the unexampled condition I am placed in falls in with Tord Coke ays this subject, whose authority is appealed to by the Crown itself; and let us home and burn our books if they are to lazon forth the law by eulogium, and accurately to define its protection, which yet the subject is to be totally cut off from, when, even under the sanction of these very authors, he stands upon his trial for his existence. Lord Coke says, in the same commentary, page 12, that the statute had not only accurately defined the care, but the nature of the proor on which alone a man shall be attainted of any of the branches of high treason,—“ It is to be observed, says he, “ that the word in the act of Edward Srd is proveABLEMENT: i. ¢, Upon direct and manifest Proof, not upon conjectural presumptions, or inJSerences, or strains of, wit, but upon good and sufficient proof. And herein the adverb proveABLY hath a great force, and signifieth a DIRECT PLAIN proof, which word the Lords and Commons in Parliament did use, Sor that the offence of treason was so heinous, and was 80 heavily and severely punished, as none other the like, and therefore the offender must be PROVEABLY attainted, which words are as forcible as upon direct and manifest proof. Note, the word is not PROBABLY, for then com. mune argumentum might have served, but the word is PRoveaBLy be attainted. 
ERSKINE 8628 Nothing can be so curiously and tautologously laboured as this commentary, of even at great prerogative lawyer lord Coke, upon this emgle word in the statute; and it manifestly shows, that, so far from its being the spirit and principle of the law of England, to loosen the construction of this statute, and to adopt rules of construction and proof, unusual to apply the ordinary rules of legal (") tele ander it, but ciionialied thee t do justice in that respect in the very body of the statute. 
ERSKINE 8629 Lord Hale treads in the same path with lord Coke, and concludes this part of the subject by the following most remarkable passagevol. i. chap. xi. 86. 
ERSKINE 8630 “ Now although the crime of high treason the greatest crime against faith, duty, ond human society, and brings with it the greatet and most fatal dangers to the government, peace, and happiness of a kingdom, or stale; and, therefore, is deservedly branded with the highest ignominy, and subjected to the greatet penalties that the laws can inflict, it appesrs, first, how necessary it was that there should ke some KNOWN, FIXED, SETTLED boundary for this great crime of treason, and of what great importance the statute of 25th of Ed:card Srd wet, iu order to that end. Second, How dangerous it is to depart from the LETTER of that state, and to multiply and enhance crimes into treasn by ambiguous and general words, such as accroaching royal power, subverting fundamental laws, and the like. And third, how dangerous it is by construction, and ANALOGY, to MAKE treasons where the LETTER of the law ha not done it
MR_EVANS 8631 For such a method admits of 1 limits, or bounds, but runs as far ard as wide as the wit and invention of accusers, and the detestation of persons accused, will carry men. 
ERSKINE 8632 Surely the admonition of this supereminent lawyer ought to sink deep into the heart of every judge, and of every juryman, who is called to administer justice under this statute; above all, in the times and under the circumstances which assemble us in this place. —Honourable men, feeling, as they ought, for the ny of government, and the tram quillity of the country, and naturally indignant against those who are supposed to have brought them into peril, ought from that very cause to proceed with more abundant caution, lest they should be surprised by their resent ments or their fears; they ought to i ieseain the judgments they form, by slow trembling steps; they ought even to fall back and look at every thing again, lest a false light should deceive them, admitting no fact but upon the foundation of clear and precise evidence, and deciding upon no intention that does not result with equal clearness from the fact—This is the universal demand of justice in every case criminal or civil; how much more especially then in this, when the judgment is every moment in danger of swept away into the fathomless abyss of 3 thousand volumes; where there is no apchoe for the understanding; where no reach of thought can look round in order to com pare their points; nor any memory be cious enough to retain even the im relation that can be collected from them? 
ERSKINE 8633 Gentlemen, my is the more affected with this consideration by a very recent example in that monstrous phenomenon which, under the name of a trial, has driven us out of Westminster-Hall for a large portion of my professional life. No man is less disposed than I am to speak lightly of great state prosecutions, which bind to their duty those who have no other superiors, nor any other control; least of allam I capable of even glancing a censure against those who have led to or conducted the impeachment, because I respect and love many of them, and know them to be amongst the best and wisest men in the nation.—I know them indeed so wellas to be persuaded that could they have foreseen the vast field it was to open, andthe length of time it was to occupy, they never would have en- gaged init; for I defy any man, not enlightened by the divine spirit, to say, with the precision and certainty of an English judge deciding upon evidence before him, that Mr. Hastings is guilty or not guilty: for who knows what is before him, or what is not
MR_EVANS 8634 Many have carried what they knew to their ves, and the living have lived long enough to forget it—Indeed 1 pray God that such another proceeding may never exist in England; because I consider it as a dishonour to the constitution, and that it brings, by its example, insecurity into the administration of justice . Every man in civilized society has aright to hold his life, liberty, property and reputation, under plain laws that can be well understood, and is intitled to have some limited specific part of his conduct, compared and examined by their standard; but he ought not for seven years, no, nor for seven days, to stand as a criminal before the highest hunan tribunal until judgment is bewildered and confounded, to come at last, perhaps, to defend himself, broken down with fatigue, and dispirited with anxiety, which, indecd, is my own condition at this moment, who am only stating the case of another—What then must be the condition of the unfortunate person whom you are trying? 
ERSKINE 8635 The next great question is, how the admonitions of these great writers are to be reconciled with what is undoubtedly to be found in other parts of their works; and I think I do mot go too far, when I say, that it ought to be the inclination of every person’s mind who is considering the meaning of any writer, particularly if he be a person of superior learning and intelligence, to reconcile as much aspossible aj] he says upon any subject, and not to adopt such a construction as necessarily raises up one part in direct opposition to another. 
ERSKINE 8636 It was the good fortune of Mr. Erskine to remedy, in his own person, the evil thus complained of, when he presided as chancellor on the trial of lord Melville
MR_EVANS 8637 Editor of Erskine's Speeches, See the trial of Henry Lord Viscount Melville—a. p. 1806, post. 
ERSKINE 8638 The law itself, indeed, adopts this sound tule of judgment in the examination of every matter which is laid before it, fora sound construction; and the judges, therefore are bound by duty as well as reason to adopt it. 
ERSKINE 8639 It apears to me, ‘hen, that the only ambiguity which arises, or can possibly arise, in the examination of the great authorities, and in the comparison of them with themselves, or with one another, is, from not rightly understanding the meaning of the term overt ACT as applied to this species of treason. The moment ae get right upon the true meanin and signification of this expression, the curtain is drawn up, and all is light and certainty. 
ERSKINE 8640 Gentlemen, an overt act of the high treason charged upon this record, I take, with great submission to the Court, to he plainly and simply this : the high treason charged, is the compassing or imagining (in other words, the intending or designing) the death of the king ; I mean his waturat peat; which being a hidden operation of the mind, an overt act is any thing which legally proves the existenoe of such traitorous design and intention—I say that the design against the king’s natural life, is the high treason under the first branch of the statute; and whatever is evidence, which may be legally laid before a jury to judge of the traitorous intention, is a legal overt act ; because an overt act is nothing but legal evidence embodied upon the record. 
ERSKINE 8641 The charge of compassing being a charge of intention, which, without a manifestation by conduct, no human tribunal could try; the statute requires by its very letter (but without 
ERSKINE 8642 ‘which letter reason must have presumed) 
ERSKINE 8643 that the intention to cut off the sovereign should be manifested Hh an open act; and as a prisoner charged with an intention, could have no notice how to defend himself without the charge of actions from whence the intention was to be imputed to him, it was always the practice, according to the sound principles of English law, to state upon the face of the indictment the overt act, which the crown charges as the means made use of by the prisoner to effect his traitorous purpose ; and as this rule was too frequently departed from, the statute of the seventh of king William enacted, for the benefit of the prisoner, that no evidence should even be given of any overt act not charged in the indictment. The charge, therefore, of the overt acts in the indictment is the notice, enacted by statute to be given to the prisoner for his protection, of the means by which the crown is to submit to the jury the existence of the traitorous purpose, which is the crime alleged against him, and in pursuance of which traitorous purpose the overt acts must also be charged to have been committed
MR_EVANS 8644 Whatever, therefore, is relevant or competent evidence to be received in support of the traitorous intention is a legal overt act, and what acts are competent to that purpose, is (as in all other cases matter of law for the judges; but whether, — 
ERSKINE 8645 after the overt acts are received upon the record as competent, and are established by proof upon the trial, they be sufficient or in- sufficient in the particular instance, to convince the jury of the traitorous compassing or intention, isa mere matter of Fact, which, from its very nature, can be reduced to no other standard than that which each man’s owa conscience and understanding erects in his mind, as the arbiter of his judgment
MR_EVANS 8646  This doctrine is by no means new nor peculiar to high treason, but pervades the whole law, and may be well illustrated in a memorable case lately decided upon writ of error in the House of Lords, and which must be in the memory of all the jude now present, who took a part in its decision—There the question was, whether, upon the establishment of a number of facts by legal evidence, the defendant had knowledge of a fact, the knowing of which would leave him defenceless—To draw that question from the jury to the judges, I demurred to theevidence, saying, that though each part of itwas legally admitted, it was for the law, by the mouth of the judges, to pronounce whether this fact of knowledge could legally be inferred from it; but the Tords, with the assentof all the judges, decided, to my perfect satisfaction, that such a demurrer to the evidence was irregular and invalid ; that the province of the jury over the effect of evidence, ought not to be so transferred to the judges, and converted into matter of law; that what was relevant evidence to come before a jury, was the province of the Court,—but that the conclusion to be drawn from admissible evidence, was the unalienable province of the country. 
ERSKINE 8647 To apply that reasoning to the case before us: The matter to be inquired of here is, the fact of the prisoner’s intention, as in the case I have just cited it was the fact of the defendant's knowledge
MR_EVANS 8648 The charge ofaconspiracy to depose the ‘king, is therefore laid before you to establish that intention ; its competency to be laid before you for that purpose, is not disputed; I am only contending with all reason and authority on my side, that it is to be submitted to your consciences and understandings, whether, even if you believed the overt act, you believe also that it proceeded from a traitorous machination against the life of the king.—I am only contending that these two beliets must coincide to establish a verdict of guilty.—I am not contending, that, under circumstances, a conspiracy to depose the kiug, and to annihilate his regal capacity, may not be strong and satisfactory evidence of the intention to destroy his LIFE; but only that in this, as in every other instance, it is for you to collect or not to collect this treason against the king’s life, according to the result of your sonscientious belief and judgment, from the acts of the prisoner laid before you; and that the establishment of the overt act, even if it were established, does nut establish the treason against the king’s life, By a consrevexce or Law: but on the contrary, the overt act, though punishable in another shape, as an independent crime, is 4 dead letter upon this record, unless you believe, exercising your exclusive jurisdiction over the facts laid before you that it was committed in accomplishment of the treason against THE NATURAL LIFE OF TaL Kine. 
ERSKINE 8649 Gentlemen, this particular crime of compassing the king’s death, is so complete an anomaly, being wholly seated in unconsummated intention, that the law cannot depart from describing it according to its real es sence, even when it is followed by his death: —a man cannot be indicted for kiliing the king, as was settled in the case of the resicides of Charles ist, after long consultation among all the judges : it was held that tie very words of the stutute must be pursued, and that although the king was actually mudered, the prisoners who destroyed him could not be charged with the act itself, as hich treason, but with the compassing of his death; the very act of the exccutioner m beheading him, being only laid as the over act upon the record
MR_EVANS 8650 There, though tne overt act was so connected with, as to becren inseparable from the traitorous intention, yet they were not contounded, because of the effect of the precedent in dissimilar cases: and although the regicides came to be tried immediately on the restoration of the king. in the day-spring of his authority, and before high prerogative judges, and under circumstances when, in any country but Englsnd, their trial would have been a mockery, their execution have becn awarded withoot even the forms of trial; yet in England, thst sacred liberty, which has for ever adorned the constitution, refused to sacrifice to zeal or et thusiasm, cither the substance or the forms of justice, Hear what the chicf baron prNounced upon that occasion : These posons are to be proceeded with according to the laws of the land, and I shull speak wothing 0 you but what are THE worns of the law. Bi the statute of Edward 3rd, it is made high treason to compass and imagine the death the king ; in no case else, imagination or com passing, without an actual effect, is punishable K4 law. He then speaks of the sacred life o! the king, and speaking of the treason, 95! — The treason consists in the wicked imetr nation which is not apparent ; but when this poison swells out of the heart, and breaks forth into action, in that case tt is high tres. THEN WHAT IS AN OVERT ACT OF AN 1MAGIS‘TION, OR COMPASSING OF THE K1No’s DBATHTRULY, IT IS ANY THING WHICH SHOWS WAIT THE IMAGINATION OF THE HEART I5. 
ERSKINE 8651 Indeed, gentlemen, the proposition is clear, that one gets confounded in therzvment from the very simplicity of it; but stl ! stand in a situation which I am determined at all events to fulfil to the utmost; and I shall therefore not leave the matter upon these authorities, but will bring it down to our own times, repeating my challenge to have produced one single authority m contradiction Lord Coke, in his third Institute, page 11, and 12, says : “ The indictment must charge that the prisoner traitorously compussed and imagined the death and destruction of the king. He says too,— There must be a compassing or imagination ; for an act without compassing, intent, or imagination, ts not within the act, as appeareth by the express letter thereof. Et actus non faci reum nisi mens sit rea. Nothing in language can more clearly illustrate my proposition. The indictment, like every ibe indictment, must charge distinctly and specifically the crime: that charge must therefore be in the very words of the statute which creates crime; the crime created by the statute not being the perpetration of any act, but being, in the rigorous severity of the law, the very contemplation, intention, and contrivance of a purpose directed to an act: that contemplation, purpose, and contrivance, must be found to exist, without which, says lord Coke, there can be no compassing : and as the intention of the mind cannot be investigated without the investigation of conduct, the overt act is required by the statute, and must be laid in the indictment and proved.— It follows from this deduction, that upon the clear principles of the English law, every act may be laid as an overt act of compassing the king’s death, which may be reasonably considered to be relevant and competent to manifest that intention; for, were rt otherwise, it would be shutting out from the view of the jury, certain conduct of the prisoner, which might, according to circumstances, lead to manifest the criminal intention of his mind; and as more than one overt act may be laid, and even overt acts of different kinds, though not in themselves substantively treason, the judges aj to be justified in law, when they ruled them to be overt acts of compassing the death of the king; because they are such acts as before the statute of king William which required that the indictment should charge all overt acts, would have been held to be relevant proof; of which relevancy of Bang the poilees ate to judge as matter of tw’; and therefore being relevant proof, must also be relevant matter of charge, because nothing can be relevantly charged which may not also he relevantly admitted to proof. These observations explain to the meanest capacity,’ in what sense lord Coke must be understood, when he says, in the very same page, that, “ 4 preparation to depose the king, and to take the king by force and strong hand, wntil he has yielded to certain demands, is a preg overt act to PRovE the compassing of the king’s death. He does not say as a PROPesrrion oF Law, that he who prepares to seize the king, compasseth his death, but thatapreparation to seize him is a sufficient overt act to Prove the compassing; and he directly gives the reason, “because of the strong, tendency it has to that end. This latter sentence destroys all ambiguity.—I agree perpa with lord Coke, and I think every judge. would so decide, upon the general principles of law and evidence, without any resort to. his authority for it; and for this plain and obvious reason : The judges who are by law to decide upon the relevancy or competencyof the proof, in every matter criminal, an civil, have immemorially sanctioned the indispensable necessity of charging the traitorous, intention as the crime, before it was required by the statute of king William.—As the crime is in its nature invisible and inscrutable, not manifested by such conduct as in the eve o! reason is indicative of the intention, which’ constitutes the crime; no overt act is there-, fore held to be sufficient to give jurisdiction, even to a jury to draw the inference in fact, of the traitorous purpose, but such acts from, whence it may be reasonably inferred; and. therefore as the restraint and imprisonment, of a prince has a greater tendency to his de-, struction than in the case of a private man,, such conspiracies are admitted to be laid ag ovett acts, upon this principle, that ifa man does air act front whence either an inevitable or a mainly probable consequence may be ex pected to follow, much more if he persists deliberately in a course of conduct, leading certainly or probably to any given conse uence, it is reasonable to believe that he foresaw such consequence, and by pursuing his purpose with that foreknowledge, the intention to produce the consequence may be. fairly imputed— But then all this is matter of Sact for the jury from the evidence, NOT MATTER OF Law For THE Court; farther than it is the privilege and duty of the judge to direct the attention of the jury to the evidence, and tg state the law as it may result from the dif ferent views the jury may entertain of the facts; and if such acts could not be laid ag overt acts, they could not be offered in evidence; and if they could not be offered ip evidence, the mind of the prisoner, which it was the object of the trial to lay open 99 a elue to his intention, would be shut up and concealed from the jury, whenever the death of the sovereign was sought by circuitous but obvious means, instead of by a direct and murderous machination.— But when they are thus submitted, as matter of charge and evidence to prove the traitorous purpose which is the erime, the security of the king and the subject is equally provided for: all the matter which has a relevancy to the crime, ig chargeable and proveable, not substantively to raise from their establishment a egae inference, but to raise a presumption in fact, capable of being weighed by the jury with alt the circumstances of the transaction, ag offered by the Crown and the Prisoner; their province being finally to say, not what was the possible or the probable consequence of the overt act laid in the Indictment, but whether it has brought them to a safe and conscientious judgment of the guilt of the Prisoner; i. e. of his guilt in compassing the death of the king, which is the treason charged in the Indictment. Lord Hale is, if possible, more direct and explicit upon the subject. He says, page 107, “ The words compass or imagine, ure of a great latitude ; they refcr to the purpose or design of the MIND oR wILt, though the purpose or design takes not effect: but compassing or imagining, singly of itself, is an INTERN aL act, and, without something to mantrest it, could not possibly fall under any judicial cognizance but of God alone; and therefore this statute requires such AW OVERT acT as may render the compassing or imagining capable of a trial and sentence by Auman jidicatures. Now can any nan possibly derive from such a writing (proceedin| too from an author of the character of Lor Hale), that an overt act of compassing, might in his judgment be an act committed inadvertently without the intention? Can any man gather from it, that a man, by falling into bad company, can be drawn in to be ilty of this species of treason by rash confier while the love of his Sovereign was glowing in his bosom
MR_EVANS 8652 Can there any Particular acts which can entitle a Judge or unsel to pronounce as a matter of law, what another man intends? or that what man intends is not a matter of fact? Is there any man that will meet the matter fairly, and advance and support that naked proposition ? At all events, it is certainly not a proposition to be dealt with publicly ; because the man whose mind is capable even of conceiving it, should be treasured up in a museum, and exhibited there as a curiosity, fur money. 
ERSKINE 8653 Gentlemen, all I am asking, however, from my argument (and I defy any power of reason upon earth to move me from it), is this: that the Prisoner being charged with intending the King’s death, you are to find whether this charge be founded or unfounded: and that therefore, put upon the record what else you will,—prove what you will,—read these books over and over again,—and let us stand here a year and a day in discoursing concerning them, —still the question must return at last to what you and you on y can resolve—Is he guilty of that base detestable intention to destroy the King? Nort whether you incline to believe that he is guilty; nor whether you suspect, nor whether it be probable ; xor whether he may be Guitty; no, but that pRoveaBLy HE Is Gurity. If you can say this upon the evidence, it is your duty to say 0, and you may, with a tranquil conscience, return to your families ; though by yonr judgment the unhappy object of it must return no more to his
MR_EVANS 8654 Alas! gentlemen, what doI say? us has no family to return to; the affectionate partner of his life has already fallen a victim to the surprise and horror which atteuded the scene now transacting—But let that melancholy reflexion pass—it should not, perhaps, have been introduced—it certainly ought to have no effect upon you who are to judge upon, your oaths.—I do not stand here to desire you to commit perjury from compassion; but at the same time my earnestness may. be forgiven, since it proceeds from a weakness common to us all. I clain:no merit with the Prisoner for my zeal; it proceeds from a selfish principle inherent in the human heart—I am Counsel, gentlemen, for myself. In ev word I utter, I feel-that I am pleading for the safety of my own life, for the lives of my children atter me, for the happiness of my country, and for the universal condition of civil society throughoyt the world. 
ERSKINE 8655 But let us return to the subject, and pursue the doctrine of lord Hale upon the true interpretation of the term overt act, as applicable to this branch of treason. Lord Hale says,. and I do beseech most. earnestly the attention of the Court and Jury to this passage—“ If men conspire the death of the king,.and thereupon provide weapons, or send letters,. this is an overt act within the statute.’ Take this to picces, and what does it amount to
MR_EVANS 8656 “ If men conspire the death of the king, that is the first thing, viz. the intention, “ and thereupon, that is, in pursuance of that wicked intention “ provide weapons, or send letters for the execution thereof, i. e. for the execution of that destruction of the Ki which they have meditated, “ this is anovert act within the statute. Surely the meaning of all this is self evident.—If the intention be against the king’s life, though theconspiracy does not immediately and direc! int to his death, yet still the overt act will te sufhcient if it be something which has so direct a tendency to that end, as to be competent rational evidence of the intention to obtain it. But the instances given by Lord Hale himself furnish the best illustration—‘ If mes. conspire to imprison the King by Force anp A STRONG HAND, until he has yielded to certain demands, and FOR THAT PURPOSE GATHER COMPANY OR WRITE LETTERS, that ts an overt act TO PROVE the compassing the King’s death, as it was held in lord Cobham’s case by oll the Judges. In this sentence lord Hale does not depart from that precision which sa eminently distinguishes all his writings; he does not say that if men conspire to imprison the king until he yields to certain demands, and for that purpose to do so and so, This is high Treason—no, nor even an overt act of high treason, though he might in legal correctly have said so; but to prevent possibility of coufounding the treason with matter which may be legally charged as relevant to the proof of it, he follows lord Coke’s expression in the third Institute, and says, This is an overt act to prove the compassing. of the king’s death :and as if by this mode expression he had not done enough to the ideas asunder, and from ab it for the rights aud liberties of the subject, he immediately adds, “ But then there must be an overt act 10 PROVE that conspiracy; and then that overt act to PROVE such design, is an overt act To PRovE the compassing of the death of the king. The language of this sentence labours in the ear from the excessive caution of the writer; afraid that his reader should jump ‘oo fast to his conclusion upona subject of such awful moment, he pulls him back, after he has read that a conspiracy to imprison the ine is an overt act to prove the compassing of his death, and says to him, but recollect that there must be an overt act to Prove, in the first Place, that conspiracy to imprison the king, and even then that intention to imprison him so manifested by the overt act, is but in its turn an overt act to prove the compassing or intentiun to destroy the king.—Nor does the great and benevolent Hale rest even here, but after this almost tedious perspicuity, he begins the next sentence with this fresh caution and limitation, “ But then this must be intended of a conspiracy ForciBLY to detain end imprison the king. What then is a conspiracy lorcibly to imrprison the king ?—surely it can require no explanation: it can only be a direct machination to seize and detain his person by rebellious torce.—Will this expression be satisfied by a conspiracy to seize speculatively upon his authority by the publication of pumphlets, which, by the inculcation of republican principles, may in the eventual circulation of a course of years, perhaps in a course of centuries, in this king's time, or in the time of a remote successor, dehauch men’s minds from the English constitution, and, by the destructivn of monarchy, involve the life of the monarch?—Will any man say that this is what the law means by a conspiracy against the King’s government, supposing even that a conspiracy against his government were synonimous with a design upon his life? Can any case be produced where a person has been found guilty of high treason under this branch of the statute, where no war has been actually levied, unless where the conspiracy has been a forcible invasion of the king’s personal liberty or security?do not mean to say that conspiracy to levy war may not, in many instances, be laid as an overt act of compassing the king’s death, because the war may be medittely or immediately pointed distinctly to his destruction or captivity ; and as lord Hale truly says, “small is the distance between the prisons and graves of Princes.— But multiply the instances as you will, still the principle presents itself. The truth of this very maxim, built upon experience, renders an overt act of this description rational and competent evidence to be left to a jury of a design against the king’s life; but it does not, therefore, change the nature of the crime, nor warrant any court to declare the overt act to be legally and conclusively indicative of the traitorous intention; because, if this be once admitted to be law, and-the jury are bound to find: the-treason upon their belicf of the existence of the overt act, the trial by the coyntry is atan end, and the judges are armed with an arbitrary uncontrollable dominion over the lives and liberties of the nation. Gentlemen, I will now proceed to show ou that the doctrines which I am insisting on ave been held by all the great judges of this country, in even the worst of times, and that they are, besides, not at all peculiar to the case of high treason, but pervade the whole system of the criminal law. Mr. Justice Foster, so justly celebrated for his writings, lays down the rule thus : It may be laid down as a general rule, that “ indictments founded UPON PENAL sTaTUTES, ESPECIALLY THE MOST PENAL, must pursue the statute so as to bring the party within tt. And this general rule is so expressly allowed to have place in high treason, that it is admitted on all hands, that an irdictment would be radically and incurably bad, unless it charged the compassing of the king’s death, as the leading and fundamental averment, and unless it formally charged the overt act to be committed in order to effectuate the traitorous purpose. Nobody ever denied this proposition ; and the present indictment is framed accordingly. Now it is needless to say that if the benignity of the general law requires this precision in the indictment, the proof must be correspondingly precise, for otherwise the subject would te rive no benefit from the strictness of the indictment; the strictness of whichcan have no other meaning in law or common sense, than the protection af the prisoner ; for if, though the indictment must directly charge a breach of the very Letter of the statute, the prisoner could, nevertheless, be convicted by evidence not amounting to a breach of the Lerren, then the strictness of the indictment would not only be no protection to the prisoner, but a direct violation of the first principles of justice criminal and civil, which call universally for the proof of all material averments in every legal proceeding. But Mr. Justice Foster expressly adverts to the necessary severity of proof, as well as of charge—for he says, that “although a case is brought within the reason of 2 penal statute, and within the mischief to be prevented, yet, if it does not come within the unequivocal etter, the benignity of the law interposeth. If the law then be thus severe in the interpretation of every penal proceeding, even down to an action for the itay of a hare or a partridge, are its constructions only to be enlarged and extended as to the statute of high treason, athough the single object of passing it was tu guard inst constructions? ; 
ERSKINE 8657 Gentlemen, the reason of the thing is so pably and invincibly in favour of this analogy, that it never met with a direct opposition. The attorney general himself distinctly admits it in one part of his address to you, though he seems to deny it in another
MR_EVANS 8658 I hope that when I state one part of his speech to be in diametrical opposition to another, he wyill not suppose that I attribute the inconsisfency to any defect, either in his understanding or his heart ; far from it—it arises, I ayn Convinced, from some of the authorities not being sufficiently understood. In the beginning of his speech he admits that the evidence must be satisfactory and convincing asto the intention; but in the latter part he seems, as it were, to take off the effect of that admission. I wish to give you the very words. I took them down at'the ime; and ifI do not state them correctly, f desire to be corrected. “I most dis tinctly disavow, said my honourable friend, “ every case of construgtion. I most distinctly disavow any like case of treason not within the letter of the statute. I most distinctly disavow cumulative treason. I most distinctly disavow enhancing guilt by parity of reason. The question umdubeedly is, whether the proof be full and satisfactory to your Teasons and consciences that the prisoner is ilty of the treason of compassing the king’s leath. gentlemen, J hope that this will always with equal honour be admitted. Now Tet us see how the rest of the learned gentle. man’s speech falls in with this—For he goes on to say, that it is by no means necessary that the distinct, specific intention should preexist the overt act. “If the overt act, says he, “be deliberately committed, it isa compassing. But how so, if the intention be adtitted to be the treason ? What benefit is obtained by the rigorous demand of the statute, that the compassing of the king’s death shall be charged by the indictment as the crime if a crime different, or short of it, can be subStituted for it in the proof: and how can the statute cf itichard and be said to be repealed, which made it Ligh treason to compass to depose the king, independently of intention upon his life, if the law shall declare, notwithstanding the repeal, that they are synonimous terms, and that the one conciustvery involves the other? Gentlemen, if we examine the most promipent cases, which have geome in judgment before judges of the most unquestionable authanity and after the constitution had become fixed, you will find every thing that I have been saying to you justitied and confirmed. The first great Stite rial, after the revolution, was the case of sir John breind, acongpirator in the assassination plot. Sir John Freind was indicted for compassing and imagining the death of king William; and the overt acts charged, and principally relied on, were, first, the sending Mr. Charnock into France to king James, to desire him to persuade the French king to send forces over to Great Britain, to levy war against, and the depose the King, and that Mr. Charnock was actually sent; and, secondly, the preparing men to be levied to form a corps to assist in the restoartion to the Pretender, and the expulsion of king William, of which sir John Freind was to:be colonel.—In this case, if the proofs were not to be wholly discredited, and the overt acts were c uently established, they went rationally to convince tbe mind of every man of the fre esisting intention tp destroy the king.—The conspiracy was not to do an act which, though it might lead eves. tually and speculatively to the xin death, might not be forescen or designed by thos who conspired together : the conspiracy was not directed to an event, probably leading to another, and a different one, and from th happening of which second, a third still diffe. rent might be engendered, which third might again lead in its consequences to a fourth slate of things, which might, in the revolution of events, bring on the death of the king, though never assed ar imagined : Freind’s conspiracy, en the contrary, for its direct and immediate object the restoration of the Pretender to the throne, by the junction of foreign and rebellious force. In my opinion (and I am not more disposed than others to push things beyond their mark in the adninistration of criminal justice), sir John Freind, if the evidence against him found credit with the jury, could have no possible defence; since the evidence went directly to prove the despatch of Charnock to France, under hi direction, to invite the French kin to bring ever the Pretender into England, to place him on the throne,—The intention, therefore, of sir John Freind to cut off king Willian, was a clear inference from the overt actia luestion; not an inference of daw for ue ourt, but of fact for the jury, under the guidance of plain common sense; because the Consequence of the Pretender's r: ng the throne must have been, the attainder o z William by act of parliament.—Some gentlemen seem to look as if they thought sot—but I should be glad to hear the positian contra dicted.—I repeat, that if the Pretender had been restored, as king of England, the legal consequence would have been, that king William would baye been a traitor and a usurper, and subject as sych to be tried at the Old Bailey, or wherever else the ki who fouk his place, thought fit to wig 4 bo Jjudgment.—From these premises, erefore, there could be go difficulty of inferring the intention; and, therefore, if ever a case ex! where, from the clearness of the inference, the province of the jury might have been overlooked, and the overt act confounded with the treason, it was in the instance of Freind; but so far was this from being the case, thet ou will find, on the contrary, every thing I lave been saying to you, since I beganaaddress you, summed up and confirmed by that most eminent istrate lord, justice Holt, who presided dipen that trial. He hegins thus : “ Gentlemen of the jury look ye, the ireuson that 1 mentioned im tht indictinent is conspiring, cumpassing, ond ime Bining the death of the king. To Prove TH CONAPIRACY AND DESIGN of she King’s DEATH, 
ERSKINE 8659 taco principal overt acts are insisted on. He does not consider the overt act of conspiracy and consultation to bethe treason, but evidence (as it undoubtedly was in that case) to prove the compassing thedeath. ‘The chief justice then states the two overt acts above mentioned, and sums up the evidence for and against the prisoner, and leaves the intention to the jury as matter of fuct
MR_EVANS 8660 For it is not till atterwards that he comes to answer the prisoner's objection in point of law, as the chief justice in terme puts it—“ there is another thing, said lord chief justice Holt, “ he did insist upon, AND THAT 18 MATTER OF Law. The statute 25th Edward III. was read, which is the great statute about treasons, and that does contain divers species of treason, and declares what shall be treason: one treason is the com‘passing and imagining the death of the king ; another is the levying war. Now says he (i. e. Freinp), “here is no war actually levied ; and a bare conspiracy to levy war, does not come within the law against treason. To pause here a little: Freind’s argument was this—whatever my iatentions might whatever my object of levying war might shave been—whatever might have been my design to levy it—however the destruction of athe king might have been effected by my conspiracy, if it had gone on—and however it might have been my intention that it should, —it is not treason within the 25th of Edward III.—To which Holt replied, a little incorrectly in language, but right in substance— “Now for that I must tell you, if there be only a conspiracy to levy war, it is Not treason ; i. e. it is not a substantive treason: it is not a treason in the abstract. “ But if the design and conspiracy be either to kill the king, or to depose him, or imprison him, or put any force or restraint upon him, i. e. personal restraint by force, “and the way of ehecting these purposes 1S BY LEVYING A waR; there the conspirucy and consultation, to leoy war for that purpose, is high treason, though no war be levied: for such consultation and conspiracy is AN OVERT aur PROVING the compassing the death of the ing. conspiracy to levy which, is an overt act to prove a design against the king’s life, though no war be actually levied? gentlemen, lord Holt himself illustrates this matter so clearly, that if I bad any thing at stake short of the honour and lite of the prisoner, I might sit down as soon as I had read it : for if one did not know it to be an extract from an ancient trial, one wouid say it was admirably and accurately written for the present purpose.—It is a sort of prophetic bird’s eye view of what we are engaged in at this moment : “ there y be war levied (continues lord Holt in Freind’s case) without any design upon the a pA nll ery pf ARaVAREN SEYEED is high treason, thoug: rposing ai igni: such a levying of war Ly pi spel ‘As for aie if persons do assemble themselves, and act with force, in opposition to some law, and hope thereby 
ERSKINE 8661 Ju 
ERSKINE 8662 But what sort of war is it, the bare to get it repealed; this is a levying war, and treason, THOUGH THE PURPOSING AND DESIGNING OF IT 1s Not so. So when they endeavour, m great numbers, witH FoRcE, tomake reformation of their own heads, without pursuing the methods of the law, that is a leoying war, BUT THE PUBPOSE AND DESIGNING iS NoT 80. But if there be, as I told you, a purpose and design To pESTroy THE Kino, aNnb (not or to depose him, but and to depose him) “ to depose him from his throne, which is proposed and designed to be effected by war thut is to be levied ; such a conspiracy and consultation to levy war FoR THE BRINGING THIS TO Pass (i. e. for bringing the king’s death to pass) “ ts an overt act of high treason. So that, gentlemen, as to that objection which he makes, IN POINT OF LAW, it ts of no force, if there be evidence sufficient to convince you that he did conspire to levy war FOR SUCH AN END. And he concludes by again leaving the intention expressly to the 
ERSKINE 8663 Itis rue END THEREFORE FOR WHIcH the war is to be levied, and not the conspiracy to do any act which the law considers as a levying of war, that constitutes an overt act uf treason against the king's life
MR_EVANS 8664 The most rebellious movements towards a reform in goverument, not directed against the king’s person, will not, according to lord Holt, support the charge before you.—I might surround the House of Commons with fifty thousand men, for the express purpose of forcing them, by duress, to repeal any law that is oifensive to me, or to pass a bill for altering elections, without being a possible object of this prosecution.—Under the other branch of the statute, I might indeed be convicted of levying war, but not of compassing the king’s death; and if I only conspired and meditated this rising to repeal laws by rebellion, I could be convicted of nothing but a high misdemeanor.—I would give my friends the case upon a special verdict, and let them hang me if they could. How much more might I give it them if the conspiracy imputed was not to effect a reform by violence, but, as in the case before us, by pamphlets and speeches, which might produce universal suffrage, which universal aucune might eat out and destroy aristocracy, which destruction might lead to the fall of monarchy, and, in the end, to the death of the king.—Gentlemen, if the cause were not too serious, I should liken it to the play with which we amuse our children. “ This is the cow with the crumpledy horn, which gored the dog, that worried the cat, that ate the rat, &c. ending in the “ house which Jack built. Ido therefore maintain, upon the express authority of lord Holt, that, to convict a prisoner, charged with this treason, it is absolutely necessary that you should be satisfied of his intention against the king's life, as charged in the indictment, and that no design against the king’s government will even bea Jegal overt act to be left to a jury as the evidence of such am intention (much less the substantive and consummate treason), unless the conspiracy be directly pointed against the person of the king. The case of lord George Gordon is opposed to this as a high and modern decision; and the attorney gencral descended indeed to a very humble and lowly authority, when he sought to maintain his argument by my own specch, as counsel for that unfortunate person. The passage of it alluded to lies at this moment before me; and I shall repeat it, and re-maintain it today.—But let it first be recollected, that lord George Gordon was not indicted for compassing or imagining the king’s death, under the first branch of the statute, but for levying war under the second. It never indecd entered into the conception of any man living, that such an indictment could have been maintained, or attempted against him: I appeal to one of your lordships now present, for whose learning and capacity I have the greatest and highest respect, and who sat upon that trial, that it was not insinuated from the bar, much less adjudged by the Court, that the evidence had any bearing upon the first branch of treason.—I know that I may safely appeal to Mr. Justice Buller for the truth of this assertion; and nothing surely in the passage from my address to the jury, has the remotest allusion to assimilate a conspiracy against the king’s government (collateral to his person) with a treason against his life— My words were, “ To compass or imagine the death of the king ; such imagination, or purpose of the mind, visible only to its great Author, being manifested by some open act ; an institution obviously directed, not only to the security of his natural person, but to the stability of the government; the lite of the prince being so interwoven with the constitution of the state, that an stent to destroy the one, is justly held to be a rebellious conSpiracy against the other. 
ERSKINE 8665 What is this but to say that the king’s sacred life is guarded by higher sanctions than the ordinary laws, because of its more inseparable connexion with the public security, and that an atlempt to destroy it is therefore made treason against the state? But the attorney general is, I am sure, too correct in his logic to say, . that the converse of the proposition is therefore maintained, and that an attack upon the king’s authority, without design upon his rson, is affirmed by the same expression to treason against his life. His correct and enlarged mind is incapable of such confusion of ideas. 
ERSKINE 8666 But it is time to quit what fell from me upon this occasion, in order to examine the ; iement of the Court; and to clothe mysel with the authority of that great and venerable magistrate, whose memory will always be dear to me, not only from the eminent services he rendered to his country in the administration of her justice, but on account of the personal peed and reverence I had for him wheo iving. 
ERSKINE 8667 Lord Mansfield, in delivering the law to the jury upon lord George lon’s trial (I areal to the trial itself, and to Mr. Justice Buller, now present, who agreed in the judgment), expressly distinguished between the safety provided for the king’s natural persoz, by the first branch of the statute, and the security of his executive power under tbe second. That great judge never had an idea that the natural person of the king, and the majesty of the king, were the same thing, nor that the treasons against them were syponimous: he knew, on the contrary, for he knew all that was to be known, that assubstantive crimes they never had been blended. I will read his own words : “ There are two kinds of levying war: one against the person of the king: to imprison, to dethrone, or to kil him ; or to make him change measures, of Temove counsellors : the other, which issaid to be levied against the majesty of the king, or, in other words, against him in his regal capacity: as when a muttitude rise and assemble to attain by force and violence apy object of a general public nature; that 1 levying war against the majesty of the king; aud inost reasonably so held, because it to dissolve all the bonds of society, to dest prepay and to overturn government; 
ERSKINE 8668 yy force of atlas, to restrain the king from reigning according to law. But then observe, gentlemen, the war must be actuelly levied ; and here again I appeal to Mr. Justice Buller, for the words of lord Mansfield, expressly referring for what he said to the authority of Lord Holt, in sir John Freind’s case, already cited: “ Lord chief justice Holt, in sir John Freind’s case, says : “ If persons do assemble themselves and act with force, in opposition to some law which they think in‘convenient, and hope thereby to get it re pealed, this is a levying war and treason.’ In the present caset it does not rest upon a0 implication that they hoped by opposition to a law to get it repealed; but the prosecution proceeds upon the direct ground, that the object was, by force and violence, to com legislature to repeal alaw; andtherefo without any doubt, I tell you the joint opinion of us all, that, if this multitude assembled, with intent by acts of force and violence, t0 compel the legislature to repeal a law, it 1s high treason. Let these words of Mansfield be taken down, and then show me the man, let his rank and capacity be they may, who can remove me from the foun dation on which I stand, when I maintain that a conspiracy to levy war for the objects of reformation, is not only not the high treason charged by this indictment, when not directly pointed against the king’s person, but that even the actual: levying it would not amount to the constitution of the crime. But this is the least material part of lord Mansfield's judgment, as applicable to the present question ; for he expressly considers THE 1NTextTIon of the prisoner, whatever be the act of treason alleged against him, to be all in all. —So far from holding the probable or even inevitable consequence of the thing done as constituting the quality of the act, he pie: nounces them to be nothing as separated from the criminal-design to produce them
MR_EVANS 8669 Lord George Gordon assembled an immense multitude around the House of Commons, a system so opposite to that of the persons accused before this commission, that it appears from the evidence they would not even allow a man to come amongst them, because he had been lord George's attorney.—The Lords and Commons were absolutely blockaded in the chambers of Parliament; and if control was the intention of the prisoner, it must be wholly immaterial what were the deliberations that were to be controlled ; whether it was the continuance of Roman Catholics under penal laws, the repeal of the septennial act, or a total change of the structure of the House ofCommons, that was the object of violence,— the attack upon the legislature of the country would have been the same. That the tultitude were actually assembled round the Houses, and brought there by the prisoner, it was impossible for me as his counsel even to think of denying, nor that their tumultuous ; proceedings were not in effect productive of great intimidation, and even danger, to the rds and Commons, in the exercise of their authority : neither did I venture to question the law, that the assembling the multitude Sor that purpose, was levying war within the gtatute.—Upon these facts, therefore, applied to the doctrines we have heard upon this trial, there would have been nothing in lord George Gordon's case to try; he must have been instantly without controversy, convicted. But lord Mansfield did not say to the jury (according to the doctrines that have been broached here), that if they found the multitude assembled by the prisoner, were in fact palpably intimidating and controlling the parliament in the exercise of their functions, he was guilty of high treason, whatever his intentions might have been.—Le did not tell them that the inevitable consequence of assembling a hundred thousand people round the legislature, being a control on their proceedings, was Lhsrefors a levying war, though collected from folly and rashness, without the intention of violence or control.—If this had been the doctrine of lord Mansfield, there would (as I paid before) have been nothing to try; for I admitted in terms, that his conduct was the gxtremity of rashness, and totally inconsistent with his rank in the country, and his station asa member of the House of Commons.— But the venerable magistrate never for a moment lost sight of the grand ruling principle of criminal justice, that crimes can have no seat but in the mind; and upon the pris ner’s intention, and ypon his intention alone, he expressly left the whole matter to the jury, with the following directions, which I shall read verbatim from the trial : 
ERSKINE 8670 “Having premised these several propositions. and principles, the subject matter for your consideration naturally resolves itself into two points : 
ERSKINE 8671 “ First, Whether this multitude did assemble and commit acts of violence, witn intent to terrify and compel the legislature to repeal the act called sirGeorge Savile’s
MR_EVANS 8672 If upon this point your opinion should he in the negative, that makes an end of the whole, and the prisoner ought to be acquitted ; but if your opi nion should be, that the intent of this multitude, and the violence they committed, was to force a repeal, there arises a second point
ERSKINE 8673 “ Whether the prisoner at the bar incited, encouraged, promoted, or assisted in raisin; this insurrection, and the terror they carri with them, wiTH THE INTENT of forcing a repeal of this law. 
ERSKINE 8674 “ Upon these two points, which you will call your attention to, depends the fate of this trial; for if either the multitude had no such intent, or supposing they had, if the prisoner was no cause, did not excite, and took no part in conducting, counselling, or fomenting the insurrection, the prisoner ought to be-ac quitted : and there is no pretence that he personally concurred in any act of violence. 
ERSKINE 8675 I therefore consider the case of lord Gordon, as a direct authority in my favour. 
ERSKINE 8676 To show that a conspiracy to depose the king, independently of ulterior intention against his life, is high treason within the statute, the attorney general next supposes that traitors had conspired to depose king William, but still to preserve him as stadtholder in Holland, and asks whether that conspiracy would not be a compassing his death: to that question I answer, that it would not have been a sunt ating the death of ine William, provided the conspirators coul have convinced the jury that their firm and bond fide intention was, to proceed no farther, and that, under that belief and impression, the jury (as they lawfully might) had negaead by their finding, the fact of the intention against the king’s natural existence
MR_EVANS 8677 I have no doubt at all, that, eee that budling, no judgment of treason could be pronounced : but the difficulty would be, to meet with a jury, who, upon the bare evidence of such a conspiracy, would find such a verdict. There might be possible cireumstances to justify such a negative of the intention, but they must come from the prisoner. -In that case the Crown would rest upon the conspiracy to depose, which would be prime facie and cogent evidence of the compassing, and leave the hard task of rebutting it, on the defendants—I say the hard task, because the case put is ofa direct rebellious force, acting against the king; not only abrogating his authority, but‘imprisoning and expelling his person from the kingdom. I am not seeking to abuse the reasots and consciences of juries in the examination of facts, but am only resisting the confounding them with arbitrary propositions of law. 
ERSKINE 8678 Gentlemen, I hope I have now a right to consider that the existence of the high treason charged against the unfortunate man before 
ERSKINE 8679 18 a matter of fact for your consideration upon the evidence
MR_EVANS 8680 To establish this point, has been the scope of all that you have been listening to, with so much indulgence and patience. It was my intention to have farther supported myself, by a great many authorities, which I have been Saborigusty extractin; from the different books of the law; but find I must pause here, lest I consume my strength in this preliminary part of the case, and leave the rest defective. 
ERSKINE 8681 Gentlemen, the persons named in the iniment, are charged with a conspiracy to subvert the rale, order, and government of this country; and it is material that you should observe most particularly the means by which it alleges this purpose was to be aecomplished
MR_EVANS 8682 The charge is not of a con spiracy to hold the convention in Scotland, which was actually held there; nor of the part they took in its actual proceedings; but the overt act, to which all the others are sabsidiary and subordinate, is, a supposed conpiracy to hold a convention in England, which never in fact was held; and consequently all the vast load of matter which it has been decided you should hear, that does not immediately connect itself with the charge in question, 1s ad laid mes you (as Court has repeatedly expressed it) to prove that in point of fact as nroceeding aes had, the ality of which is for your j ent; and as far, and as far only, 23 they can be connected with the prisoner, and the act which be stands charged with, to be left to you, as evidence of the intention with which the holding of the second convention was projected, 
ERSKINE 8683 Turs rnrention is therefore the whole cause—for the charge is notthe agreement to hold a convention, which it is notorious, self evident, and even admitted that they intended to hold; but the agreement to hold it for the purpose alleged, of assuming all the authority the state, and in fulfilment of the main intention against the life of the king, Unless, therefore, you can collect this double intention from the evidence before you, the indietment is not med. 
ERSKINE 8684 Gentlemen, the charge being of a conspiracy, which, if made out in point of fact, o&the government, and subversive of its involved’ beyorid‘all controversy, and within the certain knowledge of the conspirators, the lives of every soul that was nee in it; the first observation which I shall make to you (hecause in reason it ought to ptecede all others) is, that every act ore by the prsoners, and every sentence written by them, in the remotest degree connected with the 
ERSKINE 8685 ‘charge, or offered in evidence to it, were done and written in the public face of the world: the transactions wirich const tute the whole body of the proof, were not those of a day, but in regular series for tro years together; they were not the peculiar transaction of the prisoners, but of immense bodies of the king’s subjects, in various of the kingdom, assembled without the smallest reserve, and giving to the public, through the channel of the daily newspapers a minute and regular journal of their whole proceedings. Not a syllable have we heard read, in the week’s imprisonment we hare suffered, that we had not all of us read for months and months before the prosecution was heard of; and which, if we are not suffciently satiated, we may read again upon the file of every coffee-house in the Fingdomtt is admitted distinetly by the crown, that arform in the House of Commons is the ostensible purpose of all the proceedings laid before you; and that the attzinment of that object only, is the grammatical sense of the great body of the written evidence
MR_EVANS 8686 It rests therefore with the crown, to show by reat PRoor that this osrexsiste pu , and the whole mass of correspondence upon the table, was only a cloak to conceal a hidden machination, to subvert by force the entire authorities of the kingdom, and to assume them to themselves. Whether a reform of parliament be a wise 0 an murine expedient; whether, if it were atcomplished, it would ultimately be with benefits, er dangers, to the country, I will not undertake to investigate, and for this plain reason ; because it is wholly foreign ta the’ subject before us.—But when we ar trying the integrity of men’s intentions, and are examining whether their complaints of defects in the representation of the House of Commons, be bond fide, or uty scere stalking-horse for treason and rebelfion, it becomes a most essential inquiry, whether they be the first who have uttered these complaints; whether they have taken up notions for the first time, which never occurred to others; and whether, in seeking to interfere practt cally in an alteration of the constitution, the? have manifested, by the novelty of their com duct, a spirit inconsistent with for rity. gentlemen, I, for one, confess (for! think the safest way of defendin ol ger for his life before-an enlightened tribunsl, 5 defend him ingeenuouwsly), I, for one. co that if the defects in the constitution of pet liament, which ate the subject of the and the foundation of all the proceedings’ 
ERSKINE 8687 fore you, had never occurred to other persons at times, or, if not new, they had only existed in the history of former conspiracies, I should be afraid you would suspect, at least, that the authors of them were plotters of misehief
MR_EVANS 8688 In such a case I should naturally exthat you would ask yourselves this question—Why should it occur to the prisoner at the bar, and to a few others in the year 1794, immediately after an important revolution in another country, to find fault, on a sudden, with a constitution which had endured for si without the imputation of defect, and which no good subject had evet thought of touching with the busy hand of reformation 2 I candidly admit that such a9 qiestion would octur to the mind of every reasonable man, 4nd could admit no favourable answer—But surely this admission entitles me, on the other hand, to the concession, that if, in comparing their writings, and examining their conduct with the writings and conduct of the best and most unsuspected persons in the best and most unsuspected times, we find them treading in the paths which have distinguished their highest superiors; if we find them only exposing the same defects, and pursuing the asme or similar courses for their removal,—it would be the height of wickedness and injustice to torture expressions, and pervert conduct into treason aud rebellion, which had recently lifted up others to the love of the mation, to the confidence of the sovereign, and to all the honours of the state. The natural justness of this reasoning is so obvious, that we have only to examine the fact; and, considering under what auspices the prisoners are brought before you, it may be fit that I should set out with reminding you, that the great earl of Chatham began and established the fame and glory of his life upon the very cause in which my unfortunate clients were engaged, and that he left it as an inheritance to the present minister of the crown, as the foundation of his fame and glory after him ; apd his fame and glory were accordingly raised upon it; and if the crown’s evidence bad been carried as far back as it might have been (for the institution of only one of the two Tshdon Societies is befote us), you would have found that the Constitutional Society ewed its earliest credit with the country, if Rot its. very birth, to the Iabour of the present winister, and its ptofessed principles to hisrace the duke of Richmond, high also in his majesty’s present councils, whose plan of reform has) been clearly established by the whele of the written evidence, and by every withess examined for the crown, to have: been the type and model of all the soeeties in the supposed conspiracy, and uniacted upon in form and in substance 
ERSKINE 8689 Bey isonet before you, up to the very od of his confinement. 
ERSKINE 8690  Gemlemen, the duke of Richmond’s plan wis dalversal suffrage ad annual parlia
ERSKINE 8691 mats; and urged too with a boldness, which, when the comparison comes to be made, wilt leave in the back ground the strongest figures in the writings on the table—I do not say this sarcastically ; I mean to speak with the greatest respect of his Grace, both with regard to the wisdom and integrity of his conduct 3 for although I have always thought in politics with the illustrious person whose letter wag read to you; although I think, with Mr. Fox, that annual parliaments and universal suffrage would be nothing like an improvement in the constitution ; yet I confess that I find it easier to say so than to answer the duke of Rich. mond’s arguments on the subject; and I must say besides, speaking of his grace from a long personal knowledge, which began when I was counsel for his relation lord Keppel, that, ine dependently of his illustrious rank, which secures hin against the imputation of trifling with its existence, he is a person of an enlarged understanding, of extensive readin and of much reflection; and that his boo cannot therefore be considered as the effusion of rashnessand folly, but as the well-weighed, though perhaps erroneous, conclusions drawn from the actual condition of our affairs, viz. that without a speedy and essential reform in parliament (and there my opinion goes along with him) the very being of the country, as a reat nation, would be last. This plan of the uke of Richmond was the grand main spring of every proceeding we have to deal with; you, have fea a great number of loose conversations reported from societies, on which no reliance can be had; sometimes they have been gare bled by spies, sometimes misrepresented by ignorance ; and even, if correct, have fres quently been the extravagances of unknown individuals, not even uttered in the presencd of the prisoner, and totally unconnected with any design; for whenever their proceeds’ are appealed to, and their real object examined; by living members of them, brought beford you by the crown, to testify them under thd most solemn obligations of truth, they appear tohave been following, in form and in subs stance, the plans adopted within our memories, not only by the duke of Richmond, but by hans reds of the most eminent men in the. kingdom, The duke of Richmond formally published his lan of reform in the year 1780, in a letter to ieutenant colonel Sharman, who was at that time practically employed upon the same object in Ireland; and this 1s a most material of the case ; because yoware desired to behevd that the terms Conventson, and Deteeares, and the holding the one, and sending the other; were all collected from what had recently Ws ned. in France, and. were meant as the ormal introduction of her republican constis tution: but they who desire you to believd all this, do not believe it themselves; because they know certainly, and it has indeed already been proved by-their own witnesses, that conventions of reformers were held in Ireland, and delegates regularly sent to them, while? France was under the dominion of ber ancien 
ERSKINE 8692 ‘F 
ERSKINE 8693 government.—They knew full well that colonel Sharman, to whom the duke’s letter was addressed, was at that very moment supperting a convention in Ireland, at the head of ten thousand men inarms, for the defence of their country, without any commission from the king, any more than poor Franklow had, who is now in Newgate, for rcgimenting sixty.—These volunteers asserted and saved the liberties of Ireland; and the king would, at this day, have had no more subjects iu Ireland than he now has in America, if they had been treated as traitors to the government.—It was never imputed to colonel Sharmar and the volunteers, that they were in rebellion ,—yet they had arms in their hands, which the prisoners never dreamed of having; whilst a grand general convention was actually sitting under their auspices at the royal Exchange of Dublin, attanted by regular delegates from all the counties in Ireland.—And who were these dclegates iI will presently tear off their names from this paper, and hand it to you.—They were the greatest, the best, and proudest names in Ireland; men who had the wisdom to reflect (before it was too late for reflection) that greatness is not to be supported by tilting at interiors, till, by the separation of the higher from the lower orders of mankind, every distinction is swept away in the tempest of revolution; but in the happy harmonization of the whole community ; by conferring upon the people their rights ; sure of receiving the auspicious return of affection, and of ensusing the stability of the government, which is erected upon that just and natural basis. Gentlemen, they who put this tortured construction on conventions and deTogas, know also that repeated meetings of reforming societies, both in England and Scotland, had assumed about the same time the style of conventions, and had been attended by regular delegates, long before the phrase or could have, any existence in France; and that upon the very model of these former associations, a formal convention was actually sitting at Edinburgh, with the lord chief baron of Scotland in the chair, for promoting areform in parliament, at the very moment the Scotch Convention, following its example, assumed that title. Toreturn to this letter of the duke of Richmond : It was written to colonel Sharman, in answer to a letter to his grace, desiring to know his plan of reform, which he accordingly communicated by the letter which is in evidence ; and which plan was neither more nor less than that adopted by the prisoners, of surrounding parliament (unwilling to reform its own corruptians), yor by armed men, or by importunate multitudes, but by the still and universal voice of a whole people crarm1NG THEIR KNOWN AND UNALIENABLE RIGHTS. —Thisis so precisely the plan of the dake of Richmond, that I have almost borrowed his expressions. Lis grace says, “ The lesser reform has been attempted with every possible advantage in its favour; not enly from the zealous support of the advocates for a more effectual one, but from the assistance of men of great weight, both in and out of power. But with all these temperaments and helps it has failed. Not one proselyte has been gained from corruption, nor has the least ray of hope been held out from any quarter that the House of Commons was inclined to any other mode of reform. The weight of corruption has crushed this more gentle, as it would have defeated any more effieacious plan in the same circumstances. From that quarter, therefore, I have nothing to hope. Ir 1s rrow THE PEOPLE AT LARGE THAT I EXPECT anY Goop: and I am convinced, that the only way to make them feel that they are really porated in jhe business, eth contend for their full, clear, and indisputable rights nivel venetachetion Now how ra this doctrine apply to the defence of the pre soner
MR_EVANS 8694 TI maintain that it has the most decisive applieation ; because this book has beea put into the hands of the: crown witnesses, who have one and all of them recognised it, and declared it to have been, bona fide, the plan which they pursued. 
ERSKINE 8695 But are the crown’s witnesses worthy of credit
MR_EVANS 8696 If they are not, let us return home, since there is no evidence at all, and the cause is over—All the guilt, if any there be, proceeds from their testimony ; if they are not to be believed, they have proved nothing; since the crown cannot force upon you that part of the evidence which suits its purpose, and ask you to reject the other which does not, The witnesses are either entirely credible, or undeserving ofall credit, and Ihaveno mterest in the alternative. This is precisely the state of the cause.—For, with regard to all the evidence that is written, let it never be forgotten, that itis not upon me to defend my clients against it, but for the crown to extract from it the materials of accusation.—They do not contend that the treason is upon the surface of it, but im the datent intention ; which intention must, therefore, be supported by exe trinsic proof; but which is nevertheless directly negatived and beat down by every witmess they have called, leaviag them nothing but commentaries and criticisras against both feet and language, to which, for the present, I shall content myself with replying in the authoritative lancuage of the Court, in the earliest stage of the proceedings : 
ERSKINE 8697 fthere be ground to consider the professed purpose of any of these associations, reform in parliament, as mere colour, and as & pretext held out in order to cover deeper designs—designs against the whole constitution and government of the country; the case of those embarked in such designs is that which T have already considered. Whether this be so, Ae not, is mere matter os fact; as to which I shall only remind you, that an inquiry into acharge of this nature, which undertakes to make out that the ostensible purpose is a mere veil, under which is concealed a traitorous conspiracy, requires cool and deliberate examination, and the most attentive consideration; gnd that the result should be perfectly clear and satisfactory. In the affairs of common life, no man is justified in imputing to another a meaning contrary to what he himself exbut upon the fullest evidence
MR_EVANS 8698  i this (though it requires nothing to support it, either in reason or authority) I desire to add thedirection of lord chief justice Holt to the jury, on the trial of sir John Parkyns: tlenren; it is not fit that there should be any strained or forced construction put upon a man’s actions when he is tried for his life. You ought to have a full and satisfactory evidence that he is guilty, before you pronounce him so. In this assimilation of the writings of the societies to the writings of the duke of Richmond and others, I do not forget that it has been truly said by the lord chief justice, in the course of this very cause, that ten or twenty men’s committing crimes, furnishes no defence for other men in committing them. Certainly it does not; and I fly to no such sanctuary ; but in trying the prisoner’s intentions, and the intentions of those with whom he associated and acted, if I can show them to be only insisting upon the same principles that have distinguished the men most eminent for wisdom and virtue in the country, it will not be very easy to declaim or argue them into the pains of death, whilst our Bosoms are glowing with admiration at the works of those very persons who would condemn them. 
ERSKINE 8699 Gentlemen, it has been too much the fashion of late to overlook the genuine source of all human authority, but more especially totally to forget the character of the British House of Commons as a representative of the people; whether this has arisen trom that assembly’s having itself forgotten it, would be indecent for me to inquire into or to insinuate; but I shall preface the authorities which I-mean to collect in support of the prisoner, with the opinion on that subject of & truly celebrated writer, of whom I wish to speak with great respect: I should, indeed, be ashamed, particularly at this moment, to name him invidiously, while he is bending the pressure of a domestic misfortune, which no man out of his own family laments more sincerely than I do
MR_EVANS 8700 No difference of opinion can ever make me forget to acknowledge the sublimity. of his genius, the vast reach of his understanding, and his universal acquaintance with the histories and constitution of nations ; I also disavow the introduction of the writings, with the view of involving the author in any a parent . inconsistencies, which would tend, Indeed, to defeat rather than to advance my purpose.—I stand here to-day to claim at your hands, a fair and charitable interpretation of human conduct, and I shall not set out with giving an example of uncharitableness.—A man may have reason to change his opinions, or perhaps the defect may be in myself, who collect that they are changed ; I leave it to God to judge of the heart—my wish is, that christian charity may prevail, that the public harmony, which has been lost, may be restored; that all England may reunite in the bonds of love and affection, and that when the court is broken up by the sequel of the prisoners, all heart-burnings and animosities may cease; that, whilst yet we work in the light, we may try how we can save our country by a common effort; and that, instead of shamelessly setting one half of society against the other by the force of armed associations, and the terrors of courts of justice, our spirits and our strength may be combined in the glorious cause of our country.—By this, I do not mean in the cause of the present, war, which I protest against as unjust, calamitous, and destructive; but this is not the place for such a subject, I only advert to it to prevent mistake or misrepresentation. 
ERSKINE 8701 The history and character of the English House of Commons was formerly thus described by Mr. Burke: “‘ The House of Commons was supposed originally to be no part of the standing government of this country, but was considered asa control issuing immediately from the people, and speedily to be resolved iato the mass from whence it arose: in this respect it was in the higher part of govern: ment what juries are in the lower. The capacity of a magisteate being transitory, and that of a citizen permanent, the latter capa city, it was hoped, would of course preponderate in all discussions, not only between the people and the standing authority of the Crown, but between the people and the fleeting authority of the House of Commons itself. It was hoped, that, being of a middle nature, Letween subject and government, they would feel with a more tender and a nearer interest, every thing that concerned the people, than the other remoter and more permanent parts of legislature. 
ERSKINE 8702 ‘“ Whatever alterations time and the necessary accommodation of business may have introduced, this character can never be sustained, unless the House of Commons shall be made to bear some stamp of the actual disposition of the ple at large: it would (among public misfortunes) ‘be an evil. more natural and tolerable, that the House of Commons should be infected witb every epidemical frenay of the people, as this would indicate some consanguinity, some sympathy of nature with their constituents, than that they should, in all cases, be wholly untouched by the opinions and feelings of the’ people out of dovrs. By this want of sympathy, they would cease to be a House of Commons. 
ERSKINE 8703 “ The virtue, spirit, and essence of a House of Cummons, consists in its being the express imige of the feelings of the nation. It was Not instituted to be a control zpon the people, as of late it has been taught, by a doctrine of the most pernicious tendency, but as a control for the people. ; 
ERSKINE 8704 He then goes on to say, that to give a technical shape, a colour, dress, and duration o popular opinion, is the true office of a House of Cummons.—Mr. Burke is unquestionably correct; the control upon the people is the King’s majesty, and the hereditary privileges of the peers; the balance of the state is the control ror the people upon both, in the existence of the House of Commons; but how can that control exist ror the people, unless they have the actual electiun of the House of Commons, which, it is most notorious, they have not
MR_EVANS 8705 I hold in my hand a state of the Yepresentation which, if the thing were not otherwise notorious, I would prove to have been lately offered in proof to the House of : 
ERSKINE 8706 Commons, by an honourable friend of mine Dow present, whuse motion J had the honour to second, where it appeared that 12,000 people return near a majority of the House of Commons, and thuse again, under the control of about 200. But though these facts were admitted, all redress, and even discussion, was tefused
MR_EVANS 8707 What ought to be said of a House : 
ERSKINE 8708 of Commons that so conducts itself, it is not for me to pronounce ; J will appeal, therefore, to Mr. Burke, who says, “ that a House of Commons, which in all disputes between the people and administration presumes against the people, which punishes their disorders, but refuses even to inquire into their provocations, is an unnatural, monstrous state of things in the constitution. : 
ERSKINE 8709 But this is nothing: Mr. Burke goes on afterwards to give a more full description of Parliament, and in stronger language (let the Solicitor General take it down for his reply), than any that has been employed by those who are to be tried at present as conspirators against its existence
MR_EVANS 8710 I read the passage, to warn you against considering hard words against the House of Commons as decisive evidence of treason against the King.—The assage is in a well-known work, called, houghts on the Causes of the present Discontents; and such discontents will always be present, whilst their causes continue.— The word present will apply just as well now, and much better then tothe times when the honourable gentleman wrote his book ; fs we are new in the heart and bawels of ana ther war, and groaning under its additional burdens.—I shail therefare leaye it to the learned gentleman, who is to reply, ta show us what has happened since qur author wrote which renders the parliament less liable the same observations now. 
ERSKINE 8711 “ Tt must be always the wish of ap uncon stitutional statesman, that a House of Com mons, who are entirely dependent upon him should have every right ofthe people entirely dependent upon their pleasure. For it was soon discovered that the forms of a free, and the ends of an arbitrary government, wer things not altogether incompatible. 
ERSKINE 8712 “ The power of the Crown, almast dead and rotten as prerogative, has oe Up anew, with much more strength and far less odium, under the name of influence
MR_EVANS 8713 An influence which operated without noise and violence; which converted the very antagonist into the instrument of power; which contained init self a perpetual principle of growth and renovation; and which the distresses and the prosperity of the country equally tended to augment, was an admirable substitute fora prerogative, that, being only the offspring of antiquated prejudices, had moulded in its ¢nginal stamina irresistible principles of decay and dissolution. 
ERSKINE 8714 What is this but saying that the House of Commons is a settled and scandalous abase fastened upon the people, instead of being an antagonist power for their protection; an odious instrument of power in the hands of the Crown, instead of a popular balance against it?’ Did Mr. Burke mean that the prerogative of the crown, properly b and exercised, was an antiquated prejudice? Certainly not; because his attachment toa properly balauced monarchy is notorious, why then is it to be fastened upon the Bas soners, that they stigmatize monarchy, they also exclaim ma ainst its corruptions? In the same manner, aloe he speaks of the abuses of parliament, would it be fair in Mr. Burke to argue, from the strict legal meaning of the expression, that he included, in the censure on parliament, the king's person, of majesty, which is part of the parliament? Ia examining the work of an author you mast collect the sense of his expressions from ths subject he is discussing ; and if he is wns of the House of Commons as it affects structure and efficacy of the government, you ought to understand. the word parliament s2 as to meet the sense and obvious roeaning of the writer—Why then is this common ju tice refused to others
MR_EVANS 8715 W hy is the wo ment to be taken in its strictest and least obvious sense against a poor shoemaker or any plain tradesman at a Sheffield club, while it is interpreted in its papular, though less correct acceptation, in the works of the most distinis] scholar of .the age?—Add to this, that the cases are nat atall similar: for Mr. Burke uses the ward parliament throughaut, when he is speaking af the House of Commans, without any cancamitant words which conyey an explanation, but the sense of his subject; whereas parliament is fastened upon the prisoner ag meaning something be, yond the House of Commons, when it can have na possible meaning beyond jt; since from the beginning to the ead it is joined with the words representugion of the people : the representation af the people in parliament!—Does not this most palpably. mean the House of Commons, when we know that the people have no representation in either of the other branches of the government ? 
ERSKINE 8716 A letter has been read in evidence from Mr. Hardy to Mr. Fos, where he says their object was universal representation. Did Mr. Fox suppose, when he received this letter, that it was from a nest of republicans, clamouring publicly for an universal representative constitution like that of France 
MR_EVANS 8717 If he had, would he have sent the answer he did, and agreed to present their petition ?—They wrote also to the Society of the Friends of the People, and invited them to send delegates to the Convention : the attorney general, who has made honourable and candid mention of that body, will not suppose that it would have contented itself with’ refusing the invitation in terms of cordiality and r , if, with all the knowledge they had of their transactions, they had conceived themselves to have been invited to the formation of a body, which was to over-rule and extinguish all the authorities of the state; yet upon the perversion of these two terms, parliament and convention, against their natural interpretation, against a similar use of them by others, and against the solemn explanation of them by the Crown’s own witnesses, this whole fabric of terror and accusation stands for its support: letters, it seems, written to other people, are to be better understood by the gentlemen round this table, who never saw them till months after they were written, than by those to whom, they were addressed and sent; and no rightinterpretation, forsooth, is. to ie. expected m writings when pursued: in their regular series, but they are to he made distinct by: binding them up. in a large volume, alongside. of others totally unconnected with them, and) the very existence of: whose authors was. unknown to one another. , 
ERSKINE 8718 I will now, gentlemen, resume the reading of another. part. of Mc. Burke, and a pretty. account. it is of this same parliament: “ They. who will not conform their conduct. to the public good, and. cannot support it by. the. Prerogative of the. crown, have adopted a new. 
ERSKINE 8719 They have totally abandoned the shattered and old-fashioned fortress of prerogalve, and made a lodgment in the strong-hold of parliament itself, If they have any evil design to which there is no ordinary legal wer cdmmensurate, they bring it into pariament.. There the whole is executed trom the beginning to the end: and the power of obtaining their object absolute, and the safety in the proceeding perfect ; no rules to confine, nor after-reckonings to terrify. For parliament cannot, with any great propriety, punieh atherg, far things in which they themselves have been accomplices. Thus its control upon the executive power is lost. 
ERSKINE 8720 This is a proposition universal. It is not that the popular contral was lost under this or that administration, but, GenERaLty, that the people have no control in the House of Commons. Let any map stand up and say that he disbelieves this to be the case; I believe he would fiad nobody. to believe him, Mr. Burke pursues the subject thus: he distempers of monarchy. were the great subjects Cf appreension and redress ip the dust century—in this, the distempess of parliament. Here the word parliament, and the abuses belonging to it, are put in express oposition to the monarchy, and cannot there ore comprehend it: the distempers of parliament then are objects of setious apprehension and redress. What distempers? Not of this or that year, but tbe habitual distempers of parliament; and then follows the nature of the remedy, which shows that the prisoners are not singular in thinking that it is by rae VOICE OF THE PEOPLE ONLY that parliament can be corrected. “It is not in parliament alone, says Mr. Burke, “ that the remedy for parliamentary disorders can be completed; and hardly indeed can it begin there. Until a confidence in government is re-established, the people ought to be excited to a more strict and detailed attention to the conduct of their representatives. Standards for judging more systematically upon their conduct ought to be settled in the meetings of counties. and corporations, and yent and correct lists of. the voters in all important questions, ought to be procured. By such means something may be done.’ 
ERSKINE 8721 It was the same sense of the impossibility of a reform in parliament, without a general expression of the wishes of the people, that dic tated: the duke of Richmond’s ‘Letter : all the petitions in 1780 had been rejected: by parliament; this made the duke of Richmond exclaim, that from that qnarter no redress was to be expected, and that from. the people alone he expected any good ; and he, therefore, expressly invited them to claim and to assert an’ equal representation as their indubitable and unalienable birth-right: how to assert their rights, when parliament had already refused them without even the hope, as the duke expressed it, of: listening to them gny more? 
ERSKINE 8722 Could the people’s rights, under such circumstances, be asserted without rebellion? Certainly they might: for rebellion is, when bands of men within a state oppose themselves, by violence, to the general will, as exressed or implied by the public authority ; 
ERSKINE 8723 ut the sense of a whole people, peaceably collected, and operating by its natural and certain effect upon the public councils, is not rebellion, but is paramount to, and the parent of, authority itself. 
ERSKINE 8724 Gentlemen, I am neither vindicating, nor speaking, the language of inflammation or discontent; I shall speak nothing that can disturb the order of the state; I am full of devo‘tion to its dignity and tranquillity, and would not for worlds let fall an expression in this or in any other place that could lead to disturbance or disorder: but for that very reason, I speak with firmness of THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE, and am anxious for the redress of their complaints ; because J believe a system of attention to them to be a far better security and establishment of every part of the government, than those that are employed to preserve them.—The state and government of a country rest, for their sappart, on the great body of the people, and I hope never to hear it repeated, in any court of justice, that peaceably to convene the people upon the subject of their own potaleges can lead to the destruction of the king: they are the king’s worst enemies who hold this language.—It is a most dangerous principle, that the crown is in jeopardy, if the people are acquainted with their rights, and that the collecting them together to consider of them, leads inevitably to the destruction of the sovereign.— Do these gentlemen mean to say that the king sits upon his throne without the consent, and in defiance of the wishes of the great body of his people, and that he is kept upon it by a few individuals who call themselves his friends, in exclusion of the rest of his subjects 
MR_EVANS 8725 Las the king’s inheritance no deeper or wider roots than this? Yes, sratiemen, it has—it sands upon the love of the people, who consiler their own inheritance tobe supported by the king’s constitutional authority: this is men. It is from the revered work of Mr. Locke, and not from the revolution in France, that one of the papers in the evidence, the: most stigmatized, most obviously flowed ; for it is proved that Mr. Yorke held in his hand Mr. Locke upon government, when he delivered his speech on the Castle-hill at Sheffield, and that he expatiated largely upon it; —well, indeed, might the witness say he exatiated largely, for there are many well-selected passages taken verbatim from the book; and here, in justice to Mr. White, let me notice the fair and honourable manner in which, in the absence of the clerk, he read this extraordi performance. He delivered it not merely with distinctness, but in a manner s impressive, that, I believe, every man in court was affected by it. 
ERSKINE 8726 Gentlemen, I am not driven to defend every expression; some of them are undoubtedly improper, rash, and inflammatory ; but I see nothing in the whole taken together, even if it were connected with the prisoner, that goes atallto an evil purpose in the writer. But Mr. Attorney General has remarked upon this proceeding at Sheffield (and whatever falls from a person of his rank and just estimation, deserves great attention), he has remarked that it is quite apparent they had resolved not to petition.—They bad certainly resolved not at thut season to petition, and that seems the utmost which can be maintained from the evidence.—But supposing they bad negatived the measure altogether ; is there no way by which the people may actively asso ciate for the purposes of a retorm in parlisment, but to consider ofa petition to the House of Commons? Might they not legally as semble to consider the state of their liberties, and the conduct of their representatives 
MR_EVANS 8727 Might they not legally form conventions or meetings (for the name is just nothing) toad just a plan of rational union for a wise choice of representatives when parliament should be dissolved?—May not the people meet to consider their interests preparatory to, and independently of, a petition for any specific object?—My friend seems to consider the House of Commons as a substantive and permanent the true prop of the throne; and the love ofpart of the constitution; he seems to forget every people upon earth will for ever uphold a government, founded, as ours is, upon reason and consent, as long as government shall be itself attentive to the general interests which are the foundations and the ends of all human authority.—Let us banish then these unworthy and impolitic fears of an unrestrainedand an enlightened people; let us not tremble at the rights of man, but, by giving to men their rights, secure their affections, and, through their affections, their obedience ; —let us not broach the dangerous doctrine that the rights of kings and of men are incomseal ur government at the Revolution ye an upon their harmonious incorporation ; and Mr. Locke defended king William's title that the parliament dies a natural death; that the people then re-enter into their rights, and that the exercise of them is the most imrtant duty that can belong to social man — ow are such duties to be exercised with effect, on momentous occasions but by concert and communion?—May not the peopleassembledin their elective districts, resolve to trust no longer those by whom they have been betrayed? May they not resolve to vote for no map who contributed by his voice to this calamitous war, which has thrown such grievous and u necessary burthens upon them? May not say, “We will not vote for those who pdt 1 aaa “ At the time of this trial solicitor to tbe upon no other principle than the rights oftreasury. 
ERSKINE 8728 deny we are their constituents; not for those who question our clear and natural right to be equally represented ?"—Since it is illegal to carry up petitions, and unwise to transact any public business attended by multitudes, because it tends to tumult and disorder, may they not, for that very reason, depute, as they have done, the most trusty of their societies to meet with one another to consider, without the specific object of petitions, how they ma: 
ERSKINE 8729 claim, by means which are constitutional, their imprescriptible rights? And here I must advert to an argument employed by the attorney general, that the views of the societies towards universal suffrage, carried in themselves (however sought to be effected) animplied force upon parliament : for that, supposing by invading It with the vast pressure, not of the fips arm, but of the public sentiment of the nation, the influence of which upon that assembly is admitted ought to be weighty, it could have prevailed upon the Commons to carry up a bill to the king for universal representation and annual parliaments, his majesty was bound to reject it; and could not, without a breach of his coronation oath, consent to pass it into an act; I cannot conceive where my friend met with this law, or what he can possibly mean by asserting that the king cannot, consistently with his: coronation cath, consent to any law thatcan be stated orimagined, presented to him 4s the act of the two Houses of parliament: he could not, indeed, consent to abill sent up to him framed bya convention of delegates assuming legislative functions; and if my friend could have proved that the societies, sitting as a parliament, had sent up such a bill to his majesty, I should have thought the prisoner, as a member of such a parliament, was at least in a different situation from that in which he stands at present: but as this is not one of the chimeras whose existence is contended for, I return back to ask, .upon what authority it is maintained, that universal representation and annual parliaments could not be consented to by the king, in conformity to the wishes of theother branches of the Jegislature : on the contrary, one of the greatest men that this country ever saw considered universal representation to be such an inherent part of the constitution as that the king himself might grant it by his prerogative, even without the Lords and Commons; and I have never heard the position denied upon any other footing than the union with Scotland
MR_EVANS 8730 But be that as it may, it is enough for my purpose that the maxim, that the king might grant universal representation, as a right betore inherent in the whole people to be represented, stands upon the authority of Mr. Locke, the man, next to sir Isaae Newton, of the greatest strength of understanding that England, perhaps, ever had; high too in the favourof king William, and enjoying one of the most axalied offices in the state.—Dr. Locke says, book 2d, ch, 13, sect. 
ERSKINE 8731 157 and 158—“ Things of this world are in so’ constant a flux, that nothing remains long im the same state. Thus people, riches, trade, power, change their stations, flourishing mighty cities come to ruin, and prove, in time, neglected, desolate corners, whilst other unfrequented places grow into populous countries, hlled with wealth and inhabitants. But things not always changing equally, and private interest often keeping up customs and privileges, when the reasons of them are ceased, it often comes to pass, that in governments, where part of the legislative consists of representatives chosen by the people, that in tract of time this representation becomes very unequal and igpreorrisuate to the reasons it was at first established upon. To what gross absurdities the following of custom, when reason has left it, may lead, we may be satisfied, when we see the bare name of a town, of which there remains not so muchas the ruins, where scarce so much housing as a sheepcote, or more inhabitants than a shepherd is to be found, sends as many representatives to the grand assembly of law-makers, as a whole county, numerous in people, and powerful in Tiches. This strangers stand amazed at, and’ every one must confess needs a remedy. 
ERSKINE 8732 “ Salus populi suprema lex, is certainly so just and fundamental a rule, that he who sincerely follows it, cannot dangerously err. If, therefore, the executive, who has the power of convoking the legislative, observin: rather the true proportion, than fashion of} representation, regulates, not by old custom, but true reason, the number of members in all places that have a right to be distinctly represented, which no part of the people, however incorporated, can pretend to, but in proportion to the assistance which it affords to the public, it cannot be judged to have set up a new legislative, but to have restored the old and true one, and to have rectified the disorders which succession of time had insensibly, as well as inevitably introduced ; for it being the interest as well as intention of the people to have a fair and equal representative; whoever brings it nearest to that, is an undoubted fricnd to, and establisher of the government, and cannot miss the consent and approbation of the community; preraative lang nothing but a power, in the ands of the prince, to provide for the public good, in such cases, which depending upon’ unforeseen and uncertain occurrences, certain and unalterable laws could not safely direct ; whatsoever shall be done manifestly for the good of the people, and the establishing the government upon its true foundations, is, and always will be, just prerogative. Whatsoever cannot but be acknowledged to be of advantage to the society, and people in general, upon just and lasting measures, will always, when done, justify itself; and whenever the ople shall choose their representatives upon just and undeniably equal measures, suitable to the original frame of the government, it cannot be doubted to be the will and act ofwhole public, and of which, to avoid the very the society, whoever permitted or caused them so to do. But as the very idea of universal suffrage seems now to be considered not only to be figeiraes to, but absolutely destructive of monarchy, you certainly ought to be reminded that the book which I have been reading, and which my friend kindly gives me a note to remind you of, was written by its immortal author in defence of king WilTiam’s title to the crown; and when Dr. Sacheverel ventured to broach those doctrines of power and non-resistance, which, under the same establishments, have now become so unaccountably popular; he was impeached by the pecple’s representatives for denying their rights, which had been asserted and established at the glorious era of the Revolution. 
ERSKINE 8733 Gentlemen, if I were to go through all the matter which I have collected upon this subject, or which obtrudes it upon my mind from common reading, in a thousand direce tions, my strength would fail long before my duty was fulfilled; I had very little when E came into court, and I have abundantly less already; I must, therefore, manage what Temains to the best advantage; and shall proceed, now, to take a view of such parts of the evidence as appear to me to be the most material for the proper understanding of the case; I have had no opportunity of considering it, but in the interval which the indulgence of the Court, and your own, has afforded me, and that has been but for a very few hours this sbe p but it occurred to me, that the best use I could make of the time iven to me was, if possible, to disembroil is chaos ; to throw out of view every thing irrelevant, which only tended to bring chaos back again—to take what remained in order of time—to select certain stages and resting places—to review the effect of the transactions, ds brought before us, and then to see how the written evidence is explained by the testimony of the witnesses who have been examined 
ERSKINE 8734 The origin of the Constitutional Society not Roving bod laid im evidence before you, the chief thing both in point of date, and as applying to show the objects of the different bodies is the original address and resolution of the Corresponding: Society on its institution, and when it first to correspond with the vther, which formerly ranked amongst its members so many illustrious persons ; and before we look to the matter of this institution, let us: recollect that the objects of it were given without reserve to the public, as containing the principles of the association ; and I may — with demanding, whether the-annals of this country, or indeed the uni versal history of mankind, afford an ‘instance of a plot-and conspiracy vo! ily given up in its very infancy to government, and the tn pied: that has happened, the arraignment of conduct at a future period, and the imputation of secrecy where no secret was intended, a Tegular notice by letter was left with the secretary of state, and a receipt taken at the public office, as a proof of the publicity of their (pee and the sense they entertained of their innocence. For the views and objects of the society, we must look to the institution itself, which you are, indecd, desired to look at by the crown; for their in tentions are not considercd as deceptions in this instance, but as plainly revealed by the very writing itself. 
ERSKINE 8735 Gentlemen, there was a sort of silence in the Court—I do not say an affected one, for E mean no possible offente to any one, but there seemed to be an effect expected from beginning, not with the address itself, but with the very bold motto to it, though in verse : 
ERSKINE 8736 “ Unblest by virtue, government a league 
ERSKINE 8737 “ Becomes, a circling junto of the great 
ERSKINE 8738 “ To rob by law; religion mild, a yoke o tame the stooping soul, a trick of state 
ERSKINE 8739 “ To mask their rapine, and to share the prey. ‘“‘ Without it, what are senates, but a face 
ERSKINE 8740 “ Of consultation deep and reason free, 
ERSKINE 8741 “ While the determin’d voice and heart are sold? “ What, boasted freedom, buta soundingname 2? “ And what election, but a market vile, 
ERSKINE 8742 SOf slaves self-barter’d ? 
ERSKINE 8743 I almost fancy L heard them say to me, What think you of that to set out with — Show me the parallel of that —Gentlemen, I am sorry, for ie credit of the age we live in, to answer, that it is difficult to find the parallel; becanse the age aflords no such poet as he who wrote it: these are the words of Thompson : and it is under the banners of his Peoverbial benevolence, that these men are supposed to be engaging in plams of anarchy: oe murder; Unie “the banners of that great and good man, whose you may still see in the venerable s of Hagley, placed there by the virtuous, accomplished, and public-spirited Lyttelton : the very poem too, written under the auspices of his majesty’s royal father, when heir- apparene to the crown of Great Britain, nay, withm the very walls of Carlton-house, which afforded am asylum to matchless worth and gennis in the person of this great poet; it was under the roof of a Prince or Wates that the poem of Lrserry was written; and what better returm could be given to a prince for his protection, than to blazon, in immortal numbers, the only sure title te the crown he was to wear—rsB FREEDOM OF THE Prope or Great Barrais? And it is to be assumed, forsooth, in the yeat 1794, that the unfettunate prisoner before you was plotting treasom and rebellion, because,’ with a taste and feeling beyond bis hatrbie station, his first proceeding was ushered imo view, under the hallowed sanction of this admirable person, the friend and the defender of the British constitution; whose countrymen ere prepering at this moment (may my name descend amongst them to the it posterity!) to do honour to his immortal memory. Pardon me, gentlemen, for this desultory digression
MR_EVANS 8744 I must express myself as the current of my mind will c: me. 
ERSKINE 8745 Tf wa look at the whole of the institution itself, it exactly corresponds with the plan of the duke of Richmond, as expressed in the letters to colonel Sharman, and to the high sheriff of Sussex: this plan they propose to follow, in a public address to the nation, and all their resolutions are framed for its accomplishment; and I desire to know in what they have departed from either, and what they have done which has not been done before, without blame or censure, in the pursuance of the same object. I am not speaking of the libels they may have written, which the law is open to punish, but what part of their conduct has, as applicable to the subject in uestion, been unprecedented. —I have, at this moment, in my eye, an honourable friend of mine, and a distinguished member of the House of Commons, who, in my own remembrance, I believe in 1780, sat publicly at Guildhall, with many others, some of them magistrates of the city, as a convention of delegates, for the same objects ; and what is etill more in point, just before the convention began to meet at Edinburgh, whose proceedings have been so much relied on, there was a convention regularly assembled, attended b the delegates from all the counties of Scotland, for the express and avowed purpose of alterang (be constitution of parlament; not by rebellion, but by the same means employed by the prisoner: the lord chief baron of Scotland sat in the chair, and was assisted b: some of the first men in that country, an amongst others, by an honourable person to whom I am nearly allied, who is at the very head of the bar in Scotland, and most avowedly attached to the law and the constitution. These gentlemen, whose good intentions never fell into suspicion, had presented a petition for the alteration of election laws, which the House of Commons had rejected, and on the spur of that very rejection they met ina Convention at Edinburgh in 1793 ; and the style of their first meeting was, “A Convention of D tes, chosen from the counties of Scotland, for Altering and Amending the Laws concerning Elections —not for considering how they might be best amended —not for petitioning parliament to amend them ; but for altering and amending the election laws.—These meetings were regularly published, andIwill prove, that their first resolution, as I have read it to you, was brought up to London, and delivered to the editor of the Morning Chronicle by sir Thomes Dundas, lately created a peer of Great Britain, and paid for by him as a public advertisement. Now, suppose any man had imputed treason or sedition:to these honorable persons, what would have been the consequence? They would have been considered as infamous libellers and traducers, and deservedly hooted out of civilized life : why then are different constructions to be put upon similar transactions 
MR_EVANS 8746 Why is every thing to be held up as bone fide when the example is set, and male Jide when it is followed ?—Why have I not as good a claim to take credit for honest purpose in the poor man I am defending, against whom not a contumelious expression has been proved, as when we find the same expressions in the mouths of the duke of Richmoond or Mr. Burke?—I ask nothing more from this observation, than that a sober judgment may be pronounced from the quality of the acts which can be fairly established; each individual standing responsible only for his own conduct, instead of having our imaginations tainted with cant phrases, and a farra; of writings and speeches, for which the prisoner is not responsible, and for which the authors, if they be criminal, are liable to be brought to justice. 
ERSKINE 8747 But it will be said, gentlemen, that all the constitutional privileges of the people are conceded; that their existence was never denied or invaded; and that their right to petition and to meet for the expression of their complaints, founded or unfounded, was never called in question; these, it will be said, are the rights of subjects ; but that the “ rights of man are what alarms them: every one is considered as a traitor who talks about the “rights of man; but this bugbear stands’ upon the same perversion with its fellows. 
ERSKINE 8748 The rights of man are the foundation of all government, and to secure them is the only reason of men’s submitting to be governed, it shall not be fastened upon the unfortunate prisoner at the bar, nor upon any other man, that because these natural rights were asserted in France, by the destruction of a government which oppressed and subverted them, a process happily effected here by slow and imperceptible improvements, that therefore they can only be so asserted in England, where the government, through a gradation of improvement, is well calculated to protect them. We are, fortunately, not driven in this country to the terrible alternatives which were the unhappy lot of France, because we have had a happier destiny in the forms of a frec constitution; this, indeed, is the express language of many of the papers before you, that have been complained of; particularly in one alluded to by the Attorney General, as javing been written by a gentleman with whom am particularly acquainted; and though in that spirited composition there are, perhaps, some expressions proceeding from warmth which he may not desire me critically to justify, yet I will venture to affirm, from my own personal knowledge, that there is nota man in Court more honestly public-spirited and zealously devoted to the constitution of King, Lords, and Commons, than the honourable gentleman I allude to (Felix Vaughan, esq. Tarcister at law). It is the phrase, therefore, and not the sentiment expressed by it, that can alone give justifiable offence ; it is, it seems, a new phrase commencing in revolutions, and never used before in discussing the rights of British subjects, and therefore can only be applied in the sense of those who framed it; but this is-so far from being the truth, that the very phrase sticks in my memory, from the repeated application of it to the rights of subjects, under this and every other establishment, by a gentleman whom you will not suspect of using it in any other sense. The rights of man were considered by “Mr. Burke, at the time that the great uproar was made upon a supposed invasion of the East India Company's charter, to be the foundation of, and paramount to all, the laws and ordinances of a state : the ministry, you may remember, were turned out for Mr. Fox’s India Bill, which their opponents termed an attack upon the chartered rights of man, or, in other words, upon the abuses supported by a monopoly in trade. Hear the sentiments of Mr. Burke, when the NATURAL and CHARTERED rights of men are brought into contest. Mr. Burke, in his speech in the House of Commons, expresscd himself thus : The first objection is, that the bill is an attack on the chartered rights of men. As to this objection, I must observe that the phrase of ‘the chartered rights of men,’ is full of affectation ; and very unusual in the discussion of privileges conferred by charters of the present description. But it is not difficult to discover what end that ambiguous mode of expression, so often reiterated, is meant to answer. 
ERSKINE 8749 he rights of men, that is to say, the natural rights of mankind, are indeed sacred things; and if any public measure is proved mischievously to affect them, the objection ought to be fatal to that measure, even if no charter at all could be set up against it
MR_EVANS 8750 And if these natural rights are farther affirmed and declared by express convenants, clearly defined and secured against chicane,, power, and authority, by written instruments and positive engagements, they are in a still better condition; they then partake not only of the sanctity of the object so secured, but of that solemn public faith itself, which secures an object of such importance. Indeed, this formal recognition, by the sovereign power, of an original right in the subject, can never be subverted, but by rooting up the holding radical principles of government, and even of society itself. 
ERSKINE 8751 The Duke of Richmond also, in his publie letter to the High Sheriff of Sussex, rests the rights of the people of England upon the same horrible and damnable principle of the rights of man.—Let gentlemen, therefore, take care they do not pull down the very authority which they come here to support; let them remember, that his Majesty’s family was called to the Throne upon the very principle, that the ancient Kings of this country had violated those sacred trusts; let them recollect too in what the violation was ch: to exist; it was charged by the Bill of Rights to exist in cruel] ant infamous trials; m the packing of juries; and in disarming the people, whose arms are their unalienable retuge against oppression.—But did the people of England assemble to make this decleration
MR_EVANS 8752 No!—because it was uonecessary. The sense of the people, sent a corrupt and scandalous government, dissolved it, by almost the ordinary forms by which the old government itself was administered. K img William sent his writs to those who had sat in the former Parliament: but will any man, therefore, tell me, that that Parliament reorgani the government without the will of the le? and that it was not their consent which entailed on King William a particular inheritance, to be enlaved under the dominion of the law? Gentlemen, it was the denial of these princi ples, asserted at the revolution in En; that brought forward the author of the Ri of Man, and stirred up this controversy which has given such alarm to Government : but for this the literary labours of Mr. Paine hsd closed.—He asserts it himself in his book, and every body knows it—It was not the French revolution, but Mr. Burke's Reflec tions upon it, followed up by another work o1 the same subject, as it regarded things in England, which brought forward Mr. Paine, and which rendered his works so much the object of attention in this country—Mr. Burke denied positively the very foundation upon which the revolution of 1688 must stand for its support, viz. the right of the people to change their government ; and he asserted, m the teeth of His Majesty’s title to the Crown, that no such right in the people existed, this is the true history of the Second Part of the Rights of Man.—The First Part had little more aspect to this country than to Japan, it asserted the right of the people of France to act as they had acted, but there was litte which pointed to it as an example for England.—There had been a despotic authority in France which the people liad thrown down, and Mr. Burke seemed to question their right to do so: Mr. Paine maintained the contrary in his answer ; and having imbibed the princtples of republican government, during the «merican revolution, he mixed with the controversy many coarse and harsh remarks upon monarchy as established, even in England, or in any possible form.— But this was collateral to the great object of his work, whiclt was to maintain the right of the people to choose their government; this was the right which was questioned, and the assertion of it was most interesting to many who were most strenuously attached to the English government; since men may assert the right of every people to choose their government without seeking to destroy their own. ‘This accounts for mapy expressions imputed to the unfortunate prisoners, which I have often uttered myself, and shall continue to utter every day of my life, and call upon the spies of government to record them : I witt say ANY WHERE, WITHOUT FEAR, NAY, I WILL say HERE, WHERE I STAND, THAT AN ATTEMPT TO INTERFERE, BY DESPOTIC COMBINATION AND VIOLENCE, WITH ANY GOVERNMENT WHICH A PEOPLE CHOOSE TO GIVE TO THEMSELVES, WHETHER IT BE GOOD OR EVIL, IS AN OPPRESSION AND SUBVERSION OF THE NATURAL AND UNALIENABLE RIGHTS OF MAN; AND THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT OF THI3 COUNTRY SHOULD COUNTENANCE SUCH A SYSTEM, IT WOULD NOT ONLY BE STILL LEGAL FOR ME TO EXPRESS MY DETESTATION OF 17, a3HERE DELIBERATELY EXPRESS 1T, RUT IT WOULD BECOME MY INTEREST AND My DuTY. For, IF COMBINATIONS OF DESPOTISM CAN ACCOMPLISH SUCH A PURPOSE, WHO SHALL TELL ME, WHAT OTHER NATION SHALL NOT BE THE PREY OF THEIR AMBITION?—Upon the very principle of denying to a people the right uf governing themselves, how are we toresist the I'rench, should they attempt by violence to fasten their government upon us? Or, what inducement would there be for resistance to preserve laws, which are not, it seems, our own, but which are unalterably imposed upon us?—The very argument strikes, as with a palsy, the arm and vigour of the nation.—I Pold dear the privileges I am contending for, not as privileges hostile to the constitution, but as necessary for its preservation; and if the French were to intrude by force upon the government of our own free choice, t should leave these papers, and return toa potemior that, perhaps, I better understand. 
ERSKINE 8753 The next evidence relied on, after the institution of the Corresponding Society, isa letter written to them from Norwich, dated the 11th of November 1792, with the answer, dated the 26th of the same month : It is asserted, that this correspondence shows, they aimed at nothing less than the total destruction of the monarchy, and that they, therefore veil their intention under covert and ambiguous language. I think, on the other hand, and I shall continue to think so, as long as I am capable of thought, that it was impossible for words to convey more clearly the explicit avowal of their original plan for a constitutional reform in the House of Commons. This letter from Norwich, after congratulating the Corresponding Society. on its institution, asks several questions arising out of the proceedings of other societies in different parts of the kingdom, which they profess not thoroughly to understand. 
ERSKINE 8754 The Sheffield people (they observe) seemed at first determined to support the Duke of Richmond's plan only, but that they had afterwards observed a disposition in them to a more moderate plan of reform proposed by the Friends of the People in London; whilst the Manchester people, by addressing Mr. Paine (whom the Norwich people had not addressed) seemed to be intent on republican principles only; they thercfore-put a question, not at all of distrust, or suspicion, but bone Jide, if ever there was good faith between men, whether the Corresponding Society meant to be satisfied with the plan of the Duke of Richmond? or, whether it was their private design to rip up monarchy by the roots, and place democracy in its stead? Now hear the answer, from whence it is inferred that this last is their intention: they begin their answer with recapitulating the demand of their correspondent, as regularly as a tradesinan, who has had an order for goods, recapitulates the, order that there may be no ambiguity in the refcrence or application of the repl. , and then they say as to the objects they have in view they refer them to their addresses. “ You will thereby see that they mean to disseminate political knowledge, and thereby engage the judicious part of the nation to demand the RecovERY of their tost rights in ANNUAL Parliaments; the members of these Parliaments owing their election to unbought suffrages." They then desire them to be careful to avoid all dispute, and say to them, Put monarchy, democracy, and even religion, quite aside; and “ Let your endeavours go te increase the numbers of those who desire a full and equal representation of the people, and leave to a Parliament, so chosen, to reform all existing abuses; and if they don’t answer, atthe year’s end you may choose others in their stead. The Attorney General says, this is lamely expressed, I, on the other hand, say, that it is not only not lamely expressed, but anxiously worded to put an end to dangerous spcculations.—Leave all theories undiscussed; do not perplex yourselves with abstract questions of government; endeavour practically to get honest representatives, —and if they deceive you—then, what
MR_EVANS 8755  bring on a revolution ?—No !—Choose others in their stead. They refer also to their address, which lay before their correspondent, which address expresses itself thus: “ Laying aside all claim to originality, we claim no other merit than that of reconsidering and verifying what has already been urged in our common cause by the Duke of Richmond and Mr. Pitt, and their then honest party. 
ERSKINE 8756 When the language of the letter, which is: branded as ambiguous, thus stares them inthe face as an undeniable answer to the, charge, they then have recourse to the oldrefuge of mala fides ; all this they say is but a cover for hidden treason; but I ask you, Gentlemen, in the name of God, and as fair and honest men, what reason upon earth there is to suppose, that the writers of this letter did not mean what they expressed? Are you to pag in a Court of Justice, and n atrial for life, that men write with duplicity in their most confidential correspondence, even to those with whom they are confederated
MR_EVANS 8757 Let it be recollected also, that if this correspondence was calculated for deception, the deception must have been understood and agreed upon by all parties concerned; for otherwise you have a conspiracy amongst persons who are at cross purposes with one another: consequently the conspiracy, if’ this be a branch of it, is a conspiracy of thov-sands and ten thousands, from one end of the kingdom to the other, who are all guilty, if any uf the Prisoners are guilty : upwards of forty thousand persons, upon the lowest calculation, must alike be liable to the pains and penalties of the law, and hold their lives as tenants at will of the Ministers of the Crown.—In whatever aspect, therefore, this prosecution is regarded, new difficulties and new uncertainties and terrors surround it. 
ERSKINE 8758 The next thing in order which we have to Jook at, is the Convention at Edinburgh—It ir that a letter had been written by Mr. Skirving, who was connected with reformers in Scotland proceeding avowedly upon the duke of Richmond’s plan, proposing that there should be a convention from the societies assembled at Edinburgh : now you will recollect, in the apart that the attorney general considcred all the great original sin of this conspiracy and treason to have originated with the societies in London—that the country societies were only tools in their hands, and that the Edinburgh convention was the commencement of their projects ; and yet it plainly appears that this convention originated from neither of the London societies, but had its beginning at Edinburgh, where, just before, a convention had been sitting for the reform in parliament, attended by the principal persons in Scotland; and surely, without qirerting to the nationality so peculiar to the people of that country, it is not at all suspicious, that, since they were to hold a meeting for similar objects, they should make use of the same style for their association; and that their deputies should be called delegates, when delegates had attended the other convention from all the counties, and whom they were every day looking at in their streets, in the course of the very same year that Skirving wrote his letter on the subject. The views of the Corresponding Society, as they regarded this convention, and consequently the views of the prisoner, must be collected from the written instructions to the delegates, unless they can be falsified by matter which is collateral.—If I constitute an agent, I am bound by what he does, tut ways with this limitation, for what he does within the scope of his agency : If I constitute an agent to buy horses for me, and he commits high treason, it will not, I hope, be argued that Tam to be hanged.—If I constitute an agent for any business that can be stated, and he goes beyond his instructions, he must answer for himself beyond their Bmits; for beyond them he is not my representative.—The acts done, therefore, at the Scotch convention, whatever may be their quality, are evidence to show, that, in point of fact, a certain number of people got toether, and did any thing you choose to call illegal; but, as far as it concerns me, if I am Dot present, you are limited by my instructions and have not advanced a single step upon your journey to convict me: the instructions to Skirving have been read, and speak for themselves; they are strictly legal, and pursue the avowed object of the society; and it will be for the solicitor general to point oat, in his reply, any counter or secret instructions, or any collateral conduct, contradictory of the good faith with which they were written. ‘he instructions are in these words “ The delegates are instructed, on the part of this society, to assist in bringing forward and supporting any constitutional measure for procuring a real representation of the Commons of Great Britain. What do you say, gentlemen, to this language 
MR_EVANS 8759 how are men to sa por themselves who desire a constitotional reform? The object and the mode of effecting it were equally legal—this is most obvious from the conduct of the parliament of Ireland, acting under directions from England; they passed the convention bill, and made it only a misdemeanor, knowing that, by the law as it stood, it was no misdemeanor at all—Whether this statement may meet with the approbation of others, I care not; I know the fact to be so, and I maintain that you cannot prove upon the convention which met at Edinburgh, and which is c' today with high treason, one tho th part of what, at fass, worked up government in Ireland to the pitch of voting it a mi Gentl I ot vi icaliing kay iy Gentlemen, f am not vin that can promote disorder in the stro bat am maintaining that the worst possible di that can fall apenas country is, when subjects are deprived of the sanction of clear and usambiguous laws.—If wrong is committed, let punishment follow according to the messure of that wrong: if men are turbalent, let them be visited by the laws according to the measure of their turbulency : if they write libels upon government, let them be according to the quality of those libels: but roust not, and will not, because the staility of the monarchy is an important concern to the nation, confound the nature and distinctions of crimes, and pronounce that the life of the sovereign has been invaded, because the privileges of the people have been, perhaps, irregularly and hotly asserted : you will not, to give security to government, repeal the most sacred laws instituted for our protection, and which are, indeed, the only consideration for our submitting at all te government.—If the plain letter of the statute of Edward Srd applies to the conduct of the prieoners, let it in God’s name be apfed bet let neither their conduct, nor the aw that is to jutge it be tortured by constructon; nor transaction, from whence you are to form a dispassionate conclusion of intention, to be magnified by scandalous epithets, nor overwhelmed in an undistinguishable mass of matter, in which you may be lost and bewildered, having missed the only patts which could have furnished a elue to oo ePaper Sg Se Leesa’ lemen, this religious r the liberty of the subject, ies constructive treason, is well iltostra by Dr. Johnson, great author of our English Dictionary, a man remarkable for his love of order, and for high principles of government, but who had the wisdom to know that the great end of vernment, in all its forms, is the security of iberty and fife under the law.—This man, of Masculine mind, though disgusted at the disorder which ford George Gordon created, felt & triumph in his acquittal, and exclaimed, as we learn from Mr. Boswell, “I hate lord G. Gordon, but I am glad he was not convicted of this constructive treason ; for though I hate him, I love my country and myself"—This extraordinary man, no doubt, remembered with lord Hale, that when the law is broken injustice knows no bounds, but runs as asthe wit and invention of accusers, or the detestation of persons accused, will ca t—You will pardon this almost perpetual recurrence to these considerations; but the Present is a season when I have a right to call upon you by every thing sacred in humanity and justice; by every principle which ought 'o influence the heart of nan, to consider the Muation in which I stand before you.—I stand here for a poor, unknown, unprotected individual, charged withadesign to subvert ernment of the country, and the dearest nights of its inhabitants; a charge which col against him a force sufhcient to crush to de any private man; the whole weight of the crown presses upon him; parliament has been sitting uponex-parteevidence for Months together ; and rank and property are associated, from one end of the kingdom to the other, to avert the supposed consequences treason. I am making to complaint of this; but surely it is an awful summons to impartial attention; surely it excuses me for so often calling upon your integrity and firm. ness to do equal justice between the crown so supported, and an unhappy prisoner so unprotected. 
ERSKINE 8760 Gentlemen, I declare that I am utterly astonished, on looking at the clock, to find how long I have been speaking; and that; agitated and distressed as I am, I have yet strength enough left for the remainder of my duty; at every peril of my health it shall be exerted; for although, if this cause should es I know T shall have justice done me for the honesty of my intentions; yet what is that to the public and posterity 
MR_EVANS 8761 What is it to them, when, if upon this evidence there can stand a conviction for high treason, it is plain that n0 man can be said to have a life which is his own ?—For how can he posmbiy Roo by what engines it may be snared, or from what unknown sources it may be attacked and overpowered ?—Such a monstrous: precedent would be as ruinous to the king as tw his subjects.—We are in a crisis of our affairs; which putting justice out of the question, calls in sound policy for the greatest prudence and moderation.— At a time when Other nations are dis to subvert their establishments, let it be our wisdom to make the bad se fee) the practical benefits of our own: let us seek to bring good out of evil : the distracted inhabitants of the world will fly to us for sanctuary, driven out of their countries from the dreadful consequences of not attending to seasonable reforms in government; victims to the folly of suffering corruptions to continue, till the whole fabric of suciety is dissolved and tumbles into ruin. Landing upon our shores, they will feel the blessing of security, and they will discover in what it consists ; they will read this trial, and their hearts will palpitate at your decision : they will say to one another, and their voices will reach to the ends of the earth; may the constitution of England endure for ever !—the sacred and ios Temaining sanctuary for the oppressed : 
ERSKINE 8762 ere, and here only, the lot of man is cast in security : what though authority, established for the ends of justice, may lift itself up against it; what though the House of Commons itself should make an ex-parte declaration of guilt; what though every species of art should be employed to entangle the opi-
ERSKINE 8763 Nnions of the people, which in other countries would be inevitable destruction : yet in England, in enlightened England, all this will not pluck a hair from the head of innocence ; —the jury will still look steadfastly to the law, as the great polar star, 10 direct them in their course: as prudent men they will set no example of disorder, nor pronounce & vere dict of censure on authority, or of approbation or disapprobation beyond their judicial province: but, on the other hand, they will make no political sacrifice, but deliver a plain, honest man, from the toils of injustice—When your verdict is pronounced, this will be the judgment ofthe world; and if any amongst ourselves are alienated in their affections to government, nothing will be so likely to reclaim them : they will say—Whatever we have lost of our control in parliament, we have yet a sheetanchor remaining to hold the vessel of the state amidst contending storms: we have still, thank God, a sound administration of justice secured to us, in the independence of the judges, in the rights of enlightened juries, and in the integrity of the bar; ready at all times, and upon every possible occasion, whatever may bethe consequences to themselves, to stand forward in defence of the meanest man in England, when brought furjudgment before the laws of the country. 
ERSKINE 8764 To return to this Scotch Convention— Their papers were all seized hy government. — What their proceedings were they best know: we can only see what, parts they choose to show us: but, from what we have seen, does any man seriously believe, that this meeting at Edinburgh meant to assume and to maintain by force all the functions and authorities of the state 
MR_EVANS 8765 Is the thing within the compass of human belief?—If a man were offered 2 dukedom, ‘and twenty thousand a he for trying to believe it, he, ‘tt say be ieved it, as what will not man say for and honours? but he never in fact could lieve that this Edinburgh meeting was a patKamen ioe Great ce poe indeed mer e, from the proceedings of a few unarmed mee discusitag, in a constitutional manner, the means of obtaining a- reform in parliament; and who, to maintain the club, or whatever you choose to call it, collected a little money frony people who were well disposed to the cause ; a few shillings one day, and perhaps as many pence another?—I think as far as 1 could reckon it up, when the report from this great committee of supply was read to you, I counted that there had been raised, in the first session of this parliament, fifteen pounds, frum which indeed you must deduct two bad shillings, which are literally noticed in the ! 
ERSKINE 8766 account.—ts it to be endured, gentlemen, that men should gravely say, that this body assumed to itself the offices of parliament 
MR_EVANS 8767  that a few harmless people, who sat, as they profess, to obtain a full representation of the people, were themselves, even in their own Imaginations, the complete representation which they sought for ?—Why should they sit from day to day to consider how they might obtain what they had already got?—If their object was an universal representation of the whole people, how is it credible they could pepport that universal representation to exist in themselves—in the representatives of a few societies instituted to obtain it for the country at large ?—If they were themselves the nation, why should the language of every resolution be, that reason ought to be their grand engine for the accomplishment of their object, and should be directed to convince the nation to speak to parliament in a voice that must be heard? The proposition, there‘ore, is too to cram down the throats of the Engish people, and this is the prisoner’s security. 
ERSKINE 8768 ‘Here again he feels the advantage of our free administration of justice : this proposition on which so much depends, is not to be Teasoned upon on parchment, to be delivered Privately to magistrates for private judgment : ho—he has the privilege of appealing aloud, as he now appeals by me, to an enlightened assembly full of eyes, and ears, and intelli- ; gence where speaking to a jury is, ina manner, speaking tu a nation at large, and flying for sanctuary to its universal justice. Gentlemen, the very work of Mr. Paine, under the banners of which this supposed rebellion was set on foot, refutes the charge it is brought forward to support: for Mr. Paine, in his preface, and throughout his whole book, Teprobates the use of torce against the most evil governments; the contrary was never imputed to him.—If his book had becn written in pursuance of the design of force and rebelin, with which it is now sought to be connected, he would, like the prisoners, have been charged with an overt act of high treason; but such a proceeding was never thought of.— Mr. Pairie was indicted for a misdemeanor, and the misdemeanor was argued to consist not in the falsehood that a nation has no right to choose or alter its government, but in seditiously exciting the nation, without cause, to exercise that right.—A learned lord (lord chief baron Macdonald), now on this bench, addressed the jury as attorney general upon this principle: his language was this: The question is not, what the people have a right todo, for the people are, undoubtedly, the foundation and origin of all government ; but the charge is, for seditiously calling upon the people, without cause or reason, to exercise a right which would be sedition, supposing the right to be in them: for though the people might have a right to do the thing suggested, and though they are not excited to the doing it by force and rebellion, yet, as the suggestion goes to unsettle the state, the propagation of such doctrines is seditious. There is No other way, undoubtedly, of describing that charge. Iam not here entering into the application of it to Mr. Paine, whose counsel I was, and who has been tried already. ‘To say that the people have a right to change their perenne is indeed a truism; every body nows it, and they exercised the right, otherwise the king could not have had his establishment amongst us, If, therefore, I stir up individuals to oppose by force the general will, seated in the government, it may be treason; but to induce changes in a government, by exposing toa whole nation its errors and imperfections, can have no bearing upon such an offence : the utmost which can be made of it is a misdemeanor, and that too depending wholly upon the judgment which the jury may form of the intention of the writer, The Courts, for a long time, indeed, assumed to themselves the province of deciding upon this intention, as a matter of law, conclusively inferring it from the act of publication: “ I say the Courts assumed it, though it was not the doctrine of lord Mansfield, but handed down to him from the precedents of judges before his time: but even in that case, though the publication was the crime, not, as in this case the intention, and though the quality of the thing charged, when not rebutted by evidence for the detendant, had so long been considered to be a legal inference, yet the legislature, to support the province of the jury, and in tenderness for liberty, has lately altered the law upon this important subject. If, therefore, we were not assembled, as we are, to consider of the existence of high treason against the king’s life, but only of a misdemeanor for seditiously disturbing his title and establishment, by the proceedings for a reform in parliament, I should think the Crown, upon the very principle which, under the libel law, must now govern such a trial, quite as distant from its mark ; because, in my opinion, there is no way by which his majesty’s title can more firmly be secured, or by which (above all, in our times) its permanency can be better established, than by promoting a more full and equal representation of the people, by peaceSec the case of the Dean of St. Asaph, able means; and by what other means has itbeen sought, in this instance, to be promoted ? Gentlemen, when the members of this convention were seized, did they attempt resistance 
MR_EVANS 8769 Did they insist upon their privileges as subjects under the laws, or as a parliament enacting laws for others?—If they had said or done any thing to give colour to such an idea, there needed no spies to convict them ; the crown could have given ample indemnity for evidence from amongst themselves; the societies consisted of thousands and thousands of persons, some of whom, upon any calculation of human nature, might have been produced: the delegates, who attended the meetings, could not be supposed to have met, with adifferent intention from those who sent them; and, if the answer to that is, that the constituents are involved in the guilt of their representatives, we get back to the monstrous position from whick I observed you before to shrink back, with visible horror, when I stated a ; namely, the involving in the fate and consequence of this single trial every man, who corresponded with these societies, or who, as a member of societies in any pertof the kingdom, consented to the meeting which was assembled, or which was in prospect : but, I thank God, I have nothing to fear from those hydras, when I see before me such just and honourable men to hold the balance of justice. Gentlemen, the dissolution of this parliament speaksas strong a language asits conduct when sitting —How was it dissolved? When the magistrates entered, Mr. Skirving was in the chair, which he refused to leave : he considered and asserted his conduct to be legal, and therefore informed the magistrate be must ne his authority, — the itis; persion might appear to be involuntary, that the Subject, disturbed in his "Pealite, might be entitled to his remedy.—The magistrate on this took Mr. Skirving by the shoulder, who immediately obeyed ; the chair was quitted ina moment, and this great parliament broke up. What was the effect of all this poweeting at the time, when whatever beto it must have been best understood?—Were any of the parties indicted for high treason?—Were they indicted even for a breach of the peace in holding the Convention ?—None of these things.—The law of Scotland, arbitrary as it is, was to be disturbed to find a name for their offence, and the rules of trial to be violated to convict them: —They were denied their challenges to their Jurors, and other irregularities were. introduced, 80 as to be the subject of complaint in the House of Commons.— gentlemen, in what Tam saying, I am not standing up to vindicate all that they published during these proings, more especially those which were written in consequence of the trials I have just alluded to; but allowance must be made for a state of heat and irritation: they saw men whom they believed to be persecuted for what they conceived to be innocent; they saw them the victims of sentences which many would consider as equivalent to, if not wore than, judgment of treason: sentences which, at all events had never existed before, and such as, I believe, never will again with impunity. —But since I am on the subject of iatertion, I shall conduct myself with the same moderation which I have been prescribing ; I ; will cast no aspersions, but shall content myself with lamenting that these judgments were productive of cons Dees, which rarely follow from authority discreetly exercised. How easy is it then to di: of as much of the evidence as consu balfa day in the anathemas against the Scotch Judges! It appears that they came to variozs resolutions concerning them: seme good, some bad, and all of them irregular. Amongst others they compare them to Jeffries, and wish that they, who imitate his example, may meet his fate.—What then? — Irreverend expressions against Judges are not acts of high treason!—If they had assembled round the Court of Justiciary and hanged them in the execution of their offices, it would not have been treason within the statute— I am no advocate for disrespect to J 
ERSKINE 8770 | and think that it is dangerous to the publi order; but putting aside the insult upon the Judges now in authority, the reprobation of Jefiries is no libel, but an awful and useful tie Jelion denied the’ privdege of Bogie tice Jeffries deni privilege o! i law to an innocent man. Te rehwed ie to or Thomas Armstrong, who in vain pleaded, in bar of his outlawry, that he was out of the realm when he was exact ‘an objection so clear, that it was lately taken for to supplicate for her father the ciects 
ERSKINE 8771 Armstrong, said Jeffries, “ you may amuse yourselfmuch as you please with the ides of your innocence, but you are to be hanged next Friday ;’—and, upon the natural exclamation of a daughter at this horrible outrage against her parent, he said, “ Take that xprayers that, God Almighty’: jolgmend a prayer, that ‘y's ene light upon him. gentlemen, they did light upon him; and when, after husdeath, which speedily followed this transsction, the matter was brought before the House of Commons, under that glorious Revolution which is asserted throughout the proceedings before you, the judgment against Sir Thomas Armstrong was dec! to be a murder under colour of justice? Sir Robert Sawyer, the Attorney General, was expelled the House of Commons for his misdemeanour in refusing the writ of crror,—and the executors-of Jefferies were commanded to make compensation to the widow and the daughter of the deceased. These are great monuments of justice; and, although I by .no means approve of harsh expressions against authority, which tend to weaken the holdings of society, yet let us. not go beyond the mark in our Testraints nor suppose that men are dangerously disaffected to the government, because they feel a sort of pride and exultation in events, which constitute the dignity and glory of their country. 
ERSKINE 8772 Gentlemen, this resentment against the proceedings of the Courts in Scotland, was not donfined to those who were the objects of them ; it was not confined even to the friends of a Reform in Parliament—abenevolent public, in both parts of the island, joined them in the complaint; and a gentleman of great moderation, and a most inveterate enemy to parliamentary reform, as thinking it is not an improvement of the government, but nevertheless a lover of his country and its insulted justice, made the convictions of the delegates the subject of a public inquiry : I speak of my friend Mr. William Adam, who brought these judgments of the Scotch Judges before the House of Commons—arraigned them as contrary to law, and proposed to reverse them by the authority of Parliament. Let it not then be matter of wonder, that these poor men, who were the immediate victims of this injustice, and who saw their brethren expelled from their cuuntry by an unprecedented and questionable judgment, should feel like men on the subject, and express themselves as they felt. 
ERSKINE 8773 Gentlemen, amidst the various distresses and embarrassments which attend my present situation, it is a great consolation that I have marked from the beginning, your vigilant attention and your capacity to understand ; it is, therefore, with the utmost confidence that I ask you a few plain questions, arising out of the whole of these Scotch proceedings. In the first place, then, do you believe it to be possible, that, if these men had really projected the Convention as a traitorous usurpation of the authorities of Parliament, they would have invited the Friends of the People, im Frith-street, to assist them, when they knew that this Society was determined not to seek the reform of the constitution, but by means that were constitutional, and from whom they could neither hope for support nor concealment of evil purposes?I ask you next, if their objects had been traitorous, would they have given them, without disguise or colour, to the public and to the government, in every common newspaper? and yet it is so far from being a charge against them, that they concealed their objects by hypocrisy or guarded conduct, that I have been driven to admit the justice of the complaint against them, for unnecessary inflammation and exaggeration. I ask you rather, whether if the proceedings, thus published and exaggerated, had eppeared to Government, who knew every ing belonging to them, in the light they represent them to you today, they could possibly have slept over them with such complete indifference and silence? For itis note rious, that after this Convention had been held at Edinburgh; after, in short, every thing had been said, written, and transacted, on which I am now commenting, and after Mr. Paine’s book had been for above a year in universal circulation,—ay, up to the very day when Mr. Grey gave notice, in the House of Commons, of the intention of the Friends of the People for a reform in Parliament, there was not even a single indictment on the file. for a misdemeanor ; but, from that moment, when it was seen that the cause was not beat down or abandoned, the lamation made its appearance, and all the proceedings that followed had their birth. I ask you, lastly, Gentlemen, whether it be in human nature, that a few unprotected men, conscious in their own minds, that they had been engaged and detected ina detestable rebellion to cut off the king, to destroy the administration of justice, and to subvert the whole fabric of the government, should turn round upon their country, whose ruin they had projected, and whuse most obvious justice attached on them, complaining, forsooth, that their delegates, taken by magistrates, in the very act of high treason, had been harshly and illegally interrupted in a meritorious proceeding? The history of mankind never furnished an instance, nor ever will, of such extravagant, preposterous, and unnatural conduct! No, no, gentlemen ; all their hot blood was owing to their firm persuasion, dictated by conscious innocence, that the conduct of their delegates had been legal, and might be vindicated against the magistrates who obstructed them: in that they might be mistaken; I am not arguing that point at present: if they are hereafter indicted for a misdemeanor, and I am Counsel in that cause, I will then tell you what I think of it: sufficient for the day is thegood or evil of it, it is sufficient, for the present one, that the legality or illegality of the business has no relation to the crime that is imputed to the Prisoner. 
ERSKINE 8774 The next matter that is alleged against the authors of the Scotch Convention, and the societies which supported it, is, their having sent addresses of friendship to the conventiow of France. These addresses are considered to be a decisive proof of republican combination, verging closely ih themselves upon an syvert act of treason. Gentlemen, if the dates of these addresses are attended to, which come no lower down than November 1792, we have only to lament, that they are but the acts of private subjects, and that they were not sanctioned by the state itself—The French nation, about that period, under their new constitution, or under their new anarchy, call it which you will, were nevertheless most anxiously desirous of maintaining peace with this country.—But the king was advised to withdraw his ambassador from France, upon the approaching catastrophe of its most unfortunate prince; an event which, however to be deplored, was no justifiable cause of offence to Great Britain.—France desired nothing but the regeneration of her own government; and if she mistook the road to her prosperity, what was that to us
MR_EVANS 8775 But it was alleged against her in parliament, that she had introduced spies amongst us, and held correspondence with disaffected persons, for the destruction of our constitution; this was the charge of our minister, and it was, therefore, held to be just and necessary, for the safety of the country, to hold France at arm’s length, and to avoid the very contagion of contact with her at the risk of war.—But, gentlemen, this charge against France was thought b many, to be supported by no better proofs than those against the prisoner.—In the public correspondence of the ambassador from the French king, and upon his death, as minister from the convention, with his majesty’s sraapect of state, documents which lie upon the table of the House of Commons, and which may be made evidence in the cause, the executive council repelled with indignation all the imputations, which to this very hour are held out as the vindications of quarrel, “ If there be such persons in England, says monsieur Chauvelin—“ has not England Jaws tu punish them ?—France disavows them such men are not Frenchmen. The same Correspondence conveys the most solemn assurances of friendship down to the very end of the year 1792—a period subsequent to all the er sa and addresses complained of.—Whether these assurances were faithful orotherwise,— whether it would have been prudent to have depended on them or otherwise,— whether the war was advisable or unadvisable,—are questions over which we have no jurisdiction, I only desire to bring to your recollection, that a man may be a friend to the rights of humanity and to the imprescriptible rights of social man, which is now a term of derision and contempt, that he may feel to the very soul for a nation beset by the sword of despots, and yet be a lover of his own country and its constitution. 
ERSKINE 8776 Gentlemen, the same celebrated person, of whom I have had occasion to speak so frequently, is the best and brightest illustration of this truth. Mr. Burke, indeed, went a grat a farther than requires to be pressed into the present argument; for he maintained the cause of justice and of truth, a all the perverted authority and rash violence of his country, and expressed the feelings of a christian and a patriot in the very heat of the American war; boldly holding forth our victories as defeats ; and our successes as Calamities and disgraces. “ It is not instantly, said Mr. Burke, “ that I can be brought to rejoice, when I hear of the slaughter and eaptivity of long lists of those names which have been familiar to my ears from my infancy, and to rejoice that they have fallen under the sword of strangers, whose barbarous appellations I scarcely know how to 7 prone. The lory acquired at the Waite Plains by colonel} ille, has no charms for me; and I fairly acknowledge, that I have not yet learned to delight in finding Fort Kniphausen in the heart of the British dominions. If this had been said or written by Mr. Yorke at Sheffield, or by any other member of these societies, heated with wine at the Globe-tavern, it would have been trumpeted forth as decisive evidence of a rebellious spirit, rejoicing in the downfall of his saints yet the great author from whose writings I have borrowed, approved himself to be the friend of this nation at that calamitous crisis, and it pleased God to open the understand of our rulers, his wisdom might have averted the storms that are now thickening around us, We must not, therefore, be too severe in our strictures upon the opinions and feelings of men as they regard such mighty public ques tions
MR_EVANS 8777 The interests of a nation may often be one thing, and the interests of its government another; but the interest of those who hold government for the hour, is at all times different rom either. At the time many of the Papers before you were circulated on the subject of the war with France, many of the best and wisest men in this kingdom began to be driven by our situation to these melancholy reflections ; and thousands of persons, the most firmly attached to the principles of our constitution, and who never were members of any of these societies, considered, and still consider, Great Britain as the aggressor against France ; considered, and still consider, that she had a Tight to choose a government for herself, and that it was contrary to the first principles of justice, and, if possible, still more repugnant to the genius of uur own free constitution, to combine with despots for her destruction : who knows but that the external pressure upon France may have been the cause of that unheard-of state of society which we complain of? Who knows, but that, driven as she as been to exertions beyond the ordinary vigour of a nation, it has not been the parent of that unnatural and giant strength which threatens the authors of it with perdition? 
ERSKINE 8778 These are melancholy considerations, but they may reasonably, and at all events, be lawfully entertained? We owe obedience to government in our actions, but surely our opinions are free. 
ERSKINE 8779 Gentlemen, pursuing the order of time, we are arrived, at length, at the proposition to hold another convention, which, with the supposed support of it by force, are the only overt acts of high treason charged upon this record
MR_EVANS 8780  For, strange as it may appear, there is no charge whatever before you of any one of those acts or writings, the evidence of which consumed so many daysin reading, and which has already nearly consumed my strength in only passing them in review before you.—If every line and letter of all the writings I have een commenting upon were admitted to be traitorous machinations, and if the convention in Scotland was an open rebellion, it is cenceded to be foreign to the presen purpose, unless as such criminality in them might show the views and objects of the persons engaged in them : on that principle only the Court has over and over again decided the evidence of them to be admissible; and on the same feweipie I have illustrated them in their orler as they happened, thatImight lead the prisoner in your view up to the very point and moment when the treason is supposed to have burst forth into the overt act for which he is arraigned before you. 
ERSKINE 8781 The transaction respecting this second convention, which constitutes the principal, or more properly the only overt act in the indictment, lies in the narrowest compass, and is clouded with no ambiguity
MR_EVANS 8782 I admit freely evey act which is imputed to the prisoner, and listen not so much with fear as with curiosity and wonder, to the treason sought to be connected with it. 
ERSKINE 8783 You will recollect that the first motion towards the holding of a second convention, eriginated in a letter to the prisoner from a country correspondent, in which the legality of the former was vindicated, and its dispersion lamented : this letter was answered on the 27th of March 1794, and was read to you in the crown’s evidence in these words: “ March 27, 1794. Citizen, I am directed by the London Corresponding Society to transmit the following Resolutions to the Society for Constitutional Information, and to request the sentiments of that society respecting the important measures which the present juncture of affairs seems to require. 
ERSKINE 8784 “ The London Corresponding Society conceives that the moment is arrived, when a full and explicit declaration is necessary from all the friends of freedom—whether the late illegal and unheard-of prosecutions and sentences shall determine us to abandon our cause, or shall excite us to pursue a radical reform, with an ardour proportioned to the magnitude ef the object, and with a zeal as distinguished on our parts as the treachery of others in the same ious cause is notorious. The Society for Constitutional Information is therefore required to determine whether or no they will be ready, when called upon, to act in conjunction with this and other societies to obtain a fair representation of the PEOPLE— whether they concur with us in seeing the necessity of a speedy convention, for the purpose of obtaining, in a constitutional apd legal method, a redress of those grieoances: under which we at present labour, and which can only be effectually removed by a full and fair representation of, the people of Great Britain. The London Corresponding Society cannot but remind their friends that the present crisis demands all the prudence, unanimity, and vigour, that may or can be exerted by MEN and Britons; nor do they duubt but that manly firmness and consistency will finally, and they believe shortly, terminate in the full accomplishment of all their wishes
MR_EVANS 8785 I am, fellow citizen my humble measure), 3 friend to the rights of man. (Signed) “ T. Harpy, Secretary. 
ERSKINE 8786 They then resolve that there is no securit for the continuance of any right but in equality of daws ; not in equality of property, the ridiculous bugbear by which you are to be frightened into injustice; on the contrary throughout aver part of the proceedings, an most emphatically in Mr. Yorke’s speech, so much relied on, the bencficial subordinations of society, the seourtly of property, and the Prosperity of the landed and commercial interests, are held forth as the very objects to be attained by the reform in the representation which they sought for. 
ERSKINE 8787 In examining this first moving towards a second convention, the first thing to be considered is, what reason there is, from the letter I have just read to you, or from any thing that appears to have led to it, to suppose that a different sort of convention was projected from that which had been before assembled and dispersed
MR_EVANS 8788 The letter says another British Convention ; and it describes the same objects as the first—compare all the papers for the calling this second convention with those for assembling the first, and you will find no difference, except that they mixed with them extraneous and libellous matter, arising obviously from the irritation produced by the sailing of the transports with their brethren condemned to exile. These papers have already been considered, and separated, as they ought to be, from the charge. 
ERSKINE 8789 I will now lay before you all the remaining operations of this formidable conspiracy up to the prisoner’s imprisonment in the Tower. Mr. Hardy having received the letter just adverted to, regarding a second convention, the Corresponding Society wrote the letter of the 27th of March, and which was found in his hand-writing, and is published in the first Report, page 11. This, letter, enclosing the 
ERSKINE 8790 Resolutions they ject, was consi Society on the next day, the 28th of March, the ordinary day for their meeting, when they sent an answer to the Corresponding Society, informing them that they had received their communication, that they heartily concurred with them in the objects they had in view, and invited them to send a delegation of their members to confer with them on the subject. Now, what were the objects they concurred in, and what was to be the subject of conterence between the societies by their delegates? Look at the letter, which distinctly expresses its objects, and the means by which they sought to effect them: had these poor men (too numerous to meet all together, and therefore renewing the cause of Parliamentary Reform by delegation trom the societies) any reason to suppose, that they were involving themselves in the pains of treason, and that they were compassing the King’s death, when they were redeeming (as they thought) his authority from probable downfall and ruin? Had treason been imputed to the delegates before 
MR_EVANS 8791  Had the imagining the death of’ the King ever been suspected by any body ?—Or when they were prosecuted for misdemeanors, was the prosecution considered as an indulgence conferred upon men whose lives had been forfeited : And is it to be endured, then, in this free land, made free too by the virtue of our forefathers, who placed the King upon his throne to maintain this freedom, that forty or fifty thousand people, in the different parts of the kingdom, assembling in their little societies to spread useful knowledge, and to ditfuse the principles of liberty, which the more widely hey are spread, the surer is the condition of our free government, are iu a moment, without warning, without any law or principle to warrant it, and without precedent or example, to be branded as traitors, and to be decimated as victims for unishment! The Constitutional Society aving answered the letter of the 27th of March, in the mannerIstated to you; committees, from each of the two societies, were appointed to confer together.—The Constitutional Society appointed Mr. Joyce, Mr. Kydd, Mr. Wardle, and Mr. Holcroft, all indicted; and Mr. Sharpe, the celebrated engraver, not indicted, but examined as a witness by the Crown; five were appointed by the Correspanding Society to meet these entlemen, viz. Mr. Baxter, Mr. Moore, Mr. Thelwall, and Mr. Hodgson, all indicted, aud Mr. Lovett, against whom the bill was thrown out. These gentlemen met at the house of Mr. Thelwall on the 11th of April, and there published the resolutions already commented on, in conformity with the general objects of the two societies, cxmresecdl in the letter of the 27th of March, and agreed to continue to meet on Mondays and Thursdays for farther conference on the subject. The first Monday was the 14th of April, of which we have had come to upon the sub-heard so much, and no mecting was held oa lescd by the Constitutionalthat day; the first Thursday was the 17th of April, but there was no meeting; the 21st of April was the second Monday, but there was still no meeting ; —the 24th of April was the second Thursday when the five of the Corresponding Suciety attended, but nobody coming to meet them from the other, nuthing of course was transacted; on Monday, the 28th of April, three weeks after their frsx appointment, this blosdy and impatient band of conspirators, secing that a Convention Bill was in projection, and tbat Hessians were landing on our coasts, at last assembled them. selves; and now we come to the point of action. Gentlemen, they met; they shook hands with each other; they talked over the news and the pleasures of the day, they wished one another a good evening, and retired to their homes : it is in vain to hide it, they certainly did all these things —The same alurming scene was repeated on the three following days of meeting, and on Monday, May the 12th, would, but for the vigilance of Government, have probably again takea place: but on that day Mr. Hardy was arrested, his papers seized, and the conspiracy which pervaded this devoted country was dragged into the face of day. ‘To be ald a gentlemen, you have Literatry the whole it before you in the meetings I have just stated; in which you find ten gentlemen, appointed by two peaceable sucieties, conyersing upon the subject of a constitutional reform in parliament, publishing the result of theig deliberations, without any other arms than one supper-knife ; which, when I come to the subject of arms, I will, in form, lay before you. —Yet for this, and for this alone, you are asked to devote the prisoner before you, and his unfortunate associates, to the pains and penalties of death, and not to death alone, but to the eternal stigma and infamy of having conceived the detestable and horrible design of dissolving the government of their country, and of striking at the life of their Sovereign, who had never given offence to them, nor te any of his subjects. Gentlemen, as a conspiracy of this formidable extension, which had po less for its object than the sudden annihilation of all the existing authorities of the country, and of every thing that supported them, could not be even gravely stated to have an existence, without contemplation of force to give it effect; it was absolutely necessary to impreag upon the public mind, and to establish, hy formal evidence, upon the present occasion, that such a force was actually in preparation, —This most important and indispensable pert of the cause was attended with insurmoun able difficulties, not only from its being um founded in fact, but because it had been expressly negatived by the whole conduct of Government: for although the motions of all these societies had been watched for two years together; though their spies had regu larly attended, and collected regular journals of their proceedings ; yet when the first Report was finished, the Habeas Corpus Act suspended upon the foundation of the facts contained in it, there was not to be found, from one end of itto the other, even the insinuation of arms; I believe that this circumstance made a great impression upon all the thinking dispassionate part of the public, and that the materials of the first Report were thought to furnish but a slender argument to support such a total eclipse of liberty. No wonder, then, that the discovery of a pike in the interval hetween the two Reports, should have been highly estimated—I mean no reflections upon Government, and only state the matter, as a man of great wit very publicly reported it; he said that the discoverer, when he first bebeld the long-looked-for pike, was transported beyond himself with enthusiasm and delight, and that he hung over the rusty instrument with all the raptures of 2 fond mother, who embraces her first-born infant, “ and thanks her God for all her travail past. 
ERSKINE 8792 Tn consequence of this discovery, whoever might have the merit of it, and whatever the discoverer might have felt upon it, persons were sent by Government (and properly sent) into all corners of the kingdom to investigate the extent of the mischief; the fruit of this inquiry has been laid before you, and I pledge myself to sum up the evidence which you have had upon the subject, not by parts, or. by general observations, but in the same manner as the Court itself must sum it up tu you, when it lays the whole body of the proof with fidelity before you.—Notwithstandin: all the declamations upon French anarchy, think I may safely assert, that it has ieee distinctly proved, by the evidence, that the Sheffield people were for universal representation in a British House of Commons. This appears to have been the general sentiment, with the exception of one witness, whosoe testimony makes the truth and bona fides of the sentiments far more striking ; the witness Tallude to (George Widdison), whose evidence 1 shall state in its place, seems to bea plain, blunt, honest man, and by-the-by, which must never be forgotten of any of them, the Crown’s witness —I am not interested in the veracity of any of them, for (as I have frequently adverted to) the Crown must take them for better for worse; it must support each witness, and the whole body of its evidence throughout.—If you do not believe the whole of what is proved by a witness, what confidence can you have in part of it, or what Part can you select to confide in 
MR_EVANS 8793 If you are deceived in t, who shall measure the boundaries of the deception?—This man says he was at first for universal suffrage; Mr. Yorke had persuaded him, from all the books, that it was the best; but that be afterwards saw reason to think otherwise, and was not tor going the length of the Duke of Richmond: 
ERSKINE 8794 but that all the other Sheffield people were for the Duke’s plan; a fact soniye by the cross-examination of every one of the witnesses
MR_EVANS 8795 You have, therefore, positively and distinctly, upon the universal authority of the evidence of the Crown, the people of Sheffield, who are charged as at the head of a republican conspiracy, proved to be associated on the very principles which, at different times, have distinguished the most eminent persons in this kingdom; and the charge made upon them, with regard to arms, is cleared up by the same universal testimony. 
ERSKINE 8796 You recollect that, at a meeting held upon the Castle-hill, there were two parties in the country, and itis material to attend to what, these two parties were
MR_EVANS 8797 In consequence of the King's proclamation, a great number of honourable, zealous persons, who had been led by a thousand artifices to believe, that there was a just cause of alarm in the country, took very extraordinary steps for support of the magistracy.—The publicans were directed not to entertain persons who were friendly. to a reform of Parliament; and alarms of change and revolution pervaded the country, which became greater and greater, as our ears were hourly assailed with the successive calamities of France.—Others saw things in an opposite light, and considered that these calax mities were made the pretext for extinguishing British liberty; heart-burnings arose between the two parties; and some, I am afraid a great many, wickedly or ignorantly interposed in a quarrel which zeal had begun. —The societies were disturbed in their meetings, and even the private dwellings of many of their members were illegally violated.—It appears by the very evidence for the Crown, by which the cause must stand or fall, that many of the friends of reform were daily insulted,—their houses threatened to be pulled down, and their peaceable meetings beset by pretended magistrates, without the process of the law.—These proceedings naturally sugsted the propriety of having arms for selfHelence, the first and most unquestionable privilege of man, in or out of society, and expressly provided for by the very letter of English law.—It was ingeniously put by the learned Counsel, in the examination ef a witness, that it was complained of amongst them, that very little was sufficient to obtuin a warrant from some magistrates, and that therefore it was as well to be provided for those who might have warrants as for those who had none. gentlemen, I am too much exhausted to pursue or argue such u difference, even if it existed upon the evidence, because if the societies in question (however mistakenly) considered their mectings to be legal, and the warrants to disturb them to be beyond the authority of the magistrate to grant, they had a right, at the peril of the legal consequenees, to stand upon their defence; and it is no tranegression of the law, much less high treason against the King, to resist his officers when they Pa the bounds of their authority. So much for the general evidence of arms; and the first and last time that even the name of the prisoner is connected with the subject, is by aletter he received from a person of the name of Davison. I am anxious that this part of the case should be distinctly understood, and I will, therefore, bring back this letter to your attention’; the letter is as follows: 
ERSKINE 8798 “Fe itow-cit1zEN; —The barefaced aristocracy of the present administration has made it necessary that we should be prepared to act on the defensive, against any attack they may command their newly armed minions to make uponus. A plan has been hit upon, and, if encouraged sufficiently, will, no doubt, have the effect of furnishing a gaan of pikes to the patriots, great enough to make them formidable. The blades are made of steel, temred and polished after an approved form. hey may be fixed into any shafts ae Sir ones are recommended) of the girt of the accompanying hoops at the top end, and about an inch more at the bottom. 
ERSKINE 8799 he blades and hoops (more than which cannot properly be sent to any great distance) will be charged one shilling. Money to be sent with the orders. As the institution is in its infancy, immediate encouragement is necessary. 
ERSKINE 8800 “ Orders may be sent to the Secretary of the Sheffield Constitutional Society. “ Ricgarp Davison. Sheffield, April 24th, 1794. 
ERSKINE 8801 Gentlemen, you must recollect (for if it should escape you, it might make a great dif. ference) that Davison directs the answer to this letter to be sent to Robert Moody at Sheffield, to prevent post-office suspicion ; and that he also encloses in it a similar one, which Mr. Hardy was to forward to Norwich, in order that the society at that place might provide pikes for themselves, in the same manner that Davison was recommending, through Hardy, to the ple of London. Now what followed upon the prisoner’s receiving this letter
MR_EVANS 8802 It is in evidence, by this very Moody, to whom the answer was to be sent, and who was examined as a witness by the crown, that he never received any answer tothe letter ; and, although there was an uniseizure of papers, no such letter, nor any other, appeared to have been written; and, what is more, the letter to Norwich, from Davison, enclosed in his letter to Hardy, was never forwarded, but was found in his custody when he was arrested, three weeks afterwards, folded up in the other, and unopened, as he received it, Good God! what is become of the humane sanc of Englisheae is the sense meanin of the term proveably in the statute of kin, Edward, if such evidence can be receiv: penne an English subject, on a trial for his life?—If a man writes a letter to me about pikes, or about any thing else, can I help it? 
ERSKINE 8803 —And is it evidence (except to acquit me of suspicion) when it appears that nothing is done upon it? Mr. Hardy never before corresponded with Davison, he never desired him to write to him.—How indeed could he desire him when his very existence was unknown to him
MR_EVANS 8804 He never returned an answer; he never forwarded the enclosed to Norwich; —he never even communicated the letter itself to his own society, although he was its secretary, which showed he considered it as the unauthorized, officious co! dence of a private man; he never upon it st all, nor appears to have regarded it as dangerous or important, since he neither nor concealed it. gentlemen, I declare I hardly know in what language to e: my astonishment, that the crown can ask you shed the blood of the man at the bar upea such foundations.—Yet this is the whole of the written evidence concerning arms: forthe remainder of the plot rests, for its foundation, upon the parole evidence, the whole of which I shall pursue with precision, and not suffer 3 link of the chain to pass unexamined. 
ERSKINE 8805 ili: was the firstwitness: he swore that the Sheffield societies were fre quently insulted, and threatened to be diy persed ; so that the people in peneral oa it necessary to defend themselves against ile gal attacks : that the justices having offi: ously intruded themselves into their able and legal meetings, they thought they had a right to: be armed; but they did not claim this right under the law of nature, ot by theories of government, but as Enciiss svssects, under the government of Encraxp; for they say in their paper, which has been read by the crown that would condemn them, that they were entitled by the Brix or Ricats to be’ armed. gentlemen, they state their title truly.. The preamble of that statute enamerates the offences of king James 2d; amongst the chief of which was, his causing his subjects to be disarmed, and then our aDcestors claim this violated right as their inde feasible inheritance.—Let us therefore be ca tious ast we rush to the one men are plotting treason against the king, cause they are asserting a right, the en of which has been adjudged against a kingto be treason against the people ; and let ustot suppose that English subjects are a bandit, for preparing to defend their legal liberties with pikes, because pikes may have been accideotally employed in another country to destroy both liberty and law.—Camage says he was spoken to by this Davison about three of pikes—What then
MR_EVANS 8806 He is raz Csows’s WITNESS, WHOM THEY OFFER TO YOU AS THE WITNESS OF TRUTH, and he started with hort at the idea of violence, and spoke with visible reverence for the king; saying, God fortid that he should touch him ; but he, neverthe less, had a pike for himself. Indeed, be manliness with which he avowed it, gave is evidence —“ No additional strength to his e doubt. says he, “I had a pike, but I would not have remained an hour a member of the society, if I had heard a syllable, that it was in the contemplation of any body to employ pikes or any other arms against the king or the government.—We meant to petition parliament, through the means of the convention of Edinburgh, thinking that the House of Commons would listen to this expression of the general sentiments of the people; for it bad been thrown out, he said, in parliament, that the people did not desire it themselves. Mr. Broonthead, whose evidence I have already commented upvon, a sedate, plain, sensible man, spoke also of his affection to the government, and of the insults and threats which had been offered to the people of Sheffield: he says, “ I heard of arms on the Castle-hill, but it is fit this should be distinctly explained: a wicked hand-bill, to provoke and terrify the multitude, had been thrown about the town in the night, which caused agitation in the minds of the people; and it was then spoken of, as being the right of every individual, to have arms for defence ; but there was no idea ever started of resisting, much Jess of attaching, the government. I never heard of such athing. I fear God, said the witness, “ and honour the king; and would Not have consented to send a delegate to Edinburgh, but for peaceable and legal pur
ERSKINE 8807 The next evidence, upon the sybject of arms, is what is proved by Widdison, to which beg your particular attention, because, if there be any reliance upon his testimony, it puts an endto every criminal imputation upon Davison, through whom, in the strange manneralready observed upon, Hardy could alone be criminated. 
ERSKINE 8808 This man, Widdison, who was both a turner and hair-dresser, and who dressed Davison's hair, and was his most intimate acquaintance, gives you an account of their most confidential conversations upon the subject of the pikes, when it is impossible that they could imposing upon one another; and he decares, upon his solemn oath, that Davison, without even the knowledge or authority of the Sheffield Society, thinking that the same insults might be offered to the London Societics, wrote the letter to Hardy, of his own head, as the witness expressed it, and that he, Widdison, made the pike-shafts, to the number of a dozen and a halt
MR_EVANS 8809 Davison, he said, was his customer ; he told him that people began to think themselves in danger, and he therefore made the handles of the pikes for sale, to the number of a dozen and a half, and one likewise for himself, without conceiving that he offended against any law. “I love the King, said Widdison, “as much as any man, and all the people I associated with did the same; I would not have stayed with them if they had not : Mr. Yorke often told me privately, that he was for universal representaUon, and so were we all—THE DUKE oF RicHMOND’S PLAN WAS OUR ONLY OBJECT. 
ERSKINE 8810 This was the witness who was shown the duke’s letter, and spoke to it as being circulated, and as the very creed of the societies. —This evidence shows, beyond all doubt, the genuine sentiments of these people, because It consists of their most confidential communications with one another ; and the only answer, therefore, that can possibly be given to it is, that the witnesses, who deliver it, are. imposing upon the Court —But this (as I have wearied you with reiterating) the crown cannot smyself for, in that case, their whole proof falls to the ground together, since it is only from the same witnesses that the very existence of these pikes and their handles comes before us; and, if you suspect their evidence in part, for the reasons already given, it must be in toto rejected
MR_EVANS 8811 My friend is so good as to furnish me with this farther observation, that Widdison said he had often. heard those who called themselves aristocrats say, that if an invasion of the country should take place, they would begin with destroying their enemies at home, that they might be unanimous inthe defence of their country. — 
ERSKINE 8812 John Hill was next called: he is a cutler,. and was employed by Davison to make the’ blades for the pikes; he saw the letter which was sent to Hardy, and knew that it was sent lest there should be the same call for defence in London against illegal attacks upon the societies ; for that at Sheffield they were daily insulted, and that the opposite party came to his own house, fired muskets under the door, and threatened to pull it down; he swears that they were, to a man, faithful to the king, and that the reform proposed was in the Commons House of Parliament. 
ERSKINE 8813 John Edwards was called, farther to connect the prisoner with this combination of force: but so far from establishing it, he swore, upon his cross-examination, that his only reason for going to Hardy’s was, that he wanted a ike for his own defence, without connexion with Davison, or with Sheffield, and without concert or correspondence with any body. He had heard, he said, of the violences at Sheffield, and of the pikes that had been made there for defence ; that Hardy, on his application, showed him the letter which, as has appeared, he never showed to any other person
MR_EVANS 8814 This is the whole sum and substance of the evidence which applies to the charge of pikes, after the closest investigation, under the sanction, and by the aid of parliament itself; evidence which, s0 far from estay blishing the fact, would have been a satisfactory answer to almost any testimony b’ which such a fact could have been supported : for in this unparalleled proceeding, the prisoner’s counsel is driven by his duty to dwell upon the detail of the crown’s proofs; because the whole body ofit is the completest answer to the indictment which even a free choice itself could have selected.—It is farther worthy of your attention, that, as far as the evidence proceeds from these plain, natural sources, which the crown was driven te, for the necessary foundation of the proceedings before you, it has been simple,—uniform,— natural, and consistent ; and that whenever a different complexion was to be given to it, it was only through the medium of spies and informers, and of men, independently of their infamous trade, of the most abandoned and profligate characters. 
ERSKINE 8815 Before I advertto what has been sworn by this description of persons, I will give you a wholesome caution concerning them, and, having no eloquence of my own to enforce it, I will give it to you in the language of the same gentleman whose works are always seasonable, when moral or political lessons are to be rendered delightful. Look then at the picture of society, as Mr. Burke has drawn it, under the dominion of spies and informers: I say under their dominson, for a resort to ies may, on occasions, be justifiable, and their evidence, when confirmed, may deserve implicit credit: but I say under the dominion of spies and informers, because the case of the crown must stand alone upon their evidence, gud wpon their evidence, not only unconfirmed, but in direct contradiction to every witness, not an informer or a spy, and in a case too where the truth, whatever it zs, lies within the knowledge of forty or fifty thousand people. Mr. Burke says—I believe I can remember it without reference to the book. 
ERSKINE 8816 “ A mercenary informer knows no distincton. Under such a system, the obnoxious rere are slaves, not only to the goverament, t they live at the mercy of every individual ; they are at once the slaves of the whole community, and of every part of it; and the worst and most unmerciful men are those on whose goodness they most depend. 
ERSKINE 8817 “In this situation men not only shrink from the frowns of a stern magistrate, but are obliged to fly from their very species. The seeds of destruction are sown in civil intercourse and in social habitudes
MR_EVANS 8818 The blood of wholesome kindred is infected.—The tables and beds are surrounded with snares. All the means given by Providence to make life safe and comfortable, are perverted into instruments of terror and torment.—This species of universal subserviency that makes the very servant who waits behind your chair, the arbiter of your life and fortune, has such a tenaency to degrade and abase mankind, and to deprive them of that assured and liberal state ef mind which alone can make us what we ought to be, that I vow to God, I would sooner bring myself to put a man to immediate death for opinions I disliked, and so to get rid of the nan and his opinions at once, than to frethim witha feverish being, tainted with the gaol distemper of a contagious servitude, te keep him above ground, an animated mass of putrefaction, corrupted himself, and corvoptimg all about him. 
ERSKINE 8819 Gentlemen, let me bring to your recollection the deportment of the first of this tribe, 
ERSKINE 8820 Mr. Alexander,—who could not in halfan hour even tell where he had lived, or why be had left his master—Does any man i that he had forgotten these most recent transactions of his life? Certainly not—but bis history would have undone his credit, aod must therefore be concealed.— He had lived with a linen draper, whose address we could scarcely get from him, and they had parted because they had words: What were the words? We were not to be told that—He then went to a Mr. Kellerby’s, who agreed with him at twenty-five guineas a year.—Why did he not stay there
MR_EVANS 8821 He was obliged, it seems, to give up his lucrative agreement, be cause he was obliged to attend here as a wit ness. Gentlemen, Mr. Kellerby lives only ia Holborn, and was he obliged to give up a per manent engagement with a tradesman ip born, because he was obliged to be absent st the Old Bailey for five minutes in one sia day? I asked him ifhe had told Mr. White, solicitor for the Treasury, who would not bave been so cruel as to deprive a man of bis breed by keeping him upon attendance which night have been avoided by a particular notice.— The thing spoke for itself—he had never tod Mr. White: but had he ever told Mr. Kelerby ? for how else could he know that his place was inconsistent with his engagement upon this trial? No, he had never told him! —tHow then did he collect that his place was inconsistent with hisduty here? This question never received nal answer.—You a how he dealt with it, and how he stood stammering, not daring to lift ap his countenance in any direction,—confused,—disconcerted,— and confounded. 
ERSKINE 8822 Driven from the accusation wpon the subject of pikes, and even from the very colour of accusation, and knowing that nothing was to be done without the proof of arms, we have got this miserable, solitary knife, held up to us as the engine which was to destroy the constitution of this country; and Mr. Groves, an Old Bailey solicitor, employed 33 a spy upon the occasion, has been selected ive probability to this monstrous absurdity, yy his respectuble evidence
MR_EVANS 8823 I understs that this same gentleman has carried his sv tem of spying to sucha pitch as to practic & since this unfortunate man has beca standing a prisoner before you, proffering himself, a 2 friend, to the committee preparing his defeore that he might discover to the crown the me terials by which he meant to defend his life. —I state this only from report, and 1 hope God I am mistaken ; for humen natare star's back appalled from such atrocity, and shrinks and trembles at the very statement of it— But as to the pesiury of this miscreant, it will appear palpable beyond all question, and he shall answer for it in due seayen. He tell you he attended at Chalk Farm; and that there, forsooth, amongst about seven of e thousand pcople, he saw two or pe et with knives : he might, I should have seen many more, 28 hardly any man goes witbout a knife of some sort in his pocket.— He asked, however, it seems, where they got these knives, and was directed to Green, a hair-dresser, who deals besides in cutlery; 
ERSKINE 8824 they were enrolled under public articles, and though Franklow himself, as appears from the evidence, attended publicly at the Globe tavern in his uniform, whilst the cartouch boxes and the other accoutre uents of and accordingly this notable Mr. Groves wentthese secret cunspiraters lay publicly upon 
ERSKINE 8825 (as he told us) to Green’s, and asked to purebase a knife ; when Greenin answer to him said, “ speak low, for my wife is a damn’d aristocrat
MR_EVANS 8826 This answer was sworn to by the wretch, to give you the idea that Green, who had the knives to sell, was conscious that he kept them for an illegal and wicked purpose, that they were not to be sold in public. The door, he says, being a-jar, the man de sired him to speak low, from whence he would have you understand that it was because this aristocratic wife was within hearing.—This, gentlemen, is the testimony of Groves, and reen himself is called as the next witness ; and called by whom? Not by me—I know nothing of him, he is the crown’s own witness. —He is called to confirm Grove’s evidence ; but xot being a spy, he declared solemnly upon his oath, and I can confirm his evidence by several respectable people, that the knives in question lie constantly, and lay then, in his open shop-window, in what is called the show where cutlers, like other tradesmen, exes their ware to publ view; and that the ives differ in nothing from others publicly sold in the Strand, ant every other street in London; that he bespoke them from a rider, who came round for orders in the usual way ; 
ERSKINE 8827 that he sold only fourteen in all, and that the: 
ERSKINE 8828 were made up in little packets, one of whic Mr. Hardy had, who was to choose one for himself, but four more were found in bis possession, because he was arrested before Green had an opportunity of sending for them. Gentlemen, I think the pikes and knives ase now completely disposed of; butsomething was said also about guns; let us, therefore, see what that amounts to.—It appears that Mr. Hardy was applied to by Samuel Williams, a gun-engraver, who was not even a member of any society, and who asked him if he knew any body who wanted a gun— Hardy said he did not; and undoubtedly upon the crown’s own showing, it must be taken for granted that if at that time he had been sega! with any planof arming, he would ave given a different answer, and would have jumped at the offer : about a fortnight ards, however (Hardy in the interval having become acquainted with Franklow), Wiliams called to buy a pair of shoes, and then Hardy, recollecting his former application referred him to Franklow, who had in the most public manuer raised the forty men, who were called the Loyal Lambeth Association : so that, in order to give this transaction any bearing upon the charge, it became necessary to consicer Franklow’s associationas an armed comepiracy against the government; though the forty people who composed it were colby public advertisement; though his shop-board, exposed to the open view of all his customers and neighbours. This story, therefore, is not less contemptible than that which you ‘must have all heard concerning Mr. Walker, whom 1 went to detend at Lancaster, where that respectable gentleman was brought to trial upon such a trumped-up charge, supported by the solitary evidence of one Dunn, a most infamous witness: but what was the end of that prosecution 
MR_EVANS 8829 I ree collect it to the boneur of my friend, Mr. Law, who conducted it for the crewn, who, knowing that there were persons whose passions were agitated upon these subjects at that moment, and that many persons had enrolled themselves in societies to resist conspiracies against the government, behaved in a Most manly and honourable manner, ina manner, indeed, which the public ought te know, and which I hope it never will forget : he would not even put me upon my challenges to such persons, but withdrew them from the panel ; and when he saw the complexion of the affair, from the contradiction of the infamous witness whose testimony supported it, he honourably gave up the cause. Gentlemen, the evidence of Lynam does not require the same contradiction which fell upon Me. Groves, because it destroys itself by its own intrinsic inconsistency, I could not, indeed, if it were to save my life, undertake to state it to you.—It lasted, I think, about six or seven hours, but I have marked under different parts of it, passages so grossly contradictory, matter so impossible, so inconsistent with any course of conduct, that it will be sufficient to bring these parts to your view, to destroy all the rest. But let us first examine in what manner this matter, such as it is, was recorded.—He professed to speak from Notes, yet I observed him frequently looking up to the ceiling whilst he was speaking, when I said to him, Are you now speaking from a note? Have you got any note of what you are now saying? he answered; Ob no, this is from recullection—Good God Almighty! recollection mixing itself with notes in a case of high treason : He did not even take down the words —nay. to do the magn i justice, he did not even affect to have taken the words, but only the substance, as he himself expressed it—O EXCELLENT EVIDENCE !— THE SUBSTANCE OF WORDS TAKEN DOWN BY & SPY, AND SUPPLIED, WHEN DEFECTIVE, BY HIS memory. But I must not call hima spy for it seems he took them bond fide as a delegate, and yet bond fide as an informer; what a happy combination of fidelity ! faithful to serve, and faithful to betray, correct to record for the business of the society, and cor-to expect that a great city might be drownel rect to dissolve and to punish it !—What after all do the notes amount'to? I will advert to the parts I alluded to—they were, it seems, to go to Frith-street, to sign the Declaration of the Friends of the Liberty of the Press, which lay. there already signed by between twenty and thirty members of the House of Commons, and many other respectable and opulent men, and then they were to begin civil confasion, and the king’s head and Mr. Pitt's were to be placed on Temple- bar.—Immediately after whieh we find them resolving unanimously to thank Mr. Wharton: for his speech to support the glorious Revolution of 1688, which supports the very throne that was to be destroyed! which same speech they were to circulate in thousands for the use of the societies throughout the kingdom. —Such incoherent, impossible matter, proceeding from such a source, is unworthy of all farther concern. 5 Thus driven out of every thing which re lates to arms, and from every other matter which can possibly attach upon life, they “have recourse to an expedient, which, I declare, fills my mind with horror and terror: it is this—The Corresponding Society had (you recollect), two years before, sent delegates to Scotland, with specific instructions, peaceably to pursue a parliamentary reform; when the convention: which they were sent to was dis‘persed, they sent no others—for they were arrested when only considering of the propriety of another convention. It happened that Mr. Hardy was the secretary during the riod of these Scotch proceedings, and the letters consequently written by tim, during that period, were all official letters froma -’ body circulated by him in pointofform. When the proposition took place for calling a second convention, Mr. Hardy continued to be secretary, and in that character, signed the circular letter read in the evidence for the crown, ‘which sprees to have found its way, in the course of circulation, into Scortanp. This single circumstance has been admitted as the foundation of receiving in evidence against the prisoner, a long transaction imputed to one Watt, at Edinburgh, whose very existence was unknown to Hardy.—This Watt had been employed by government as a spy, but at last caught a Tartar in his spyship; for, in endeavouring to urge innocent men to 8 project, which never entered into their imaginations, he was obliged to show himself ready to do what he recommended to others ; “and the tables being turned upon him, he “was hanged by his employers. —This man Watt read from a paper designs to be accomplished, but which he never intended to attempt, and the success of which he knew to be visionary.—To suppose that Great Britain could have been destreyed by such arebel as Watt, would be, as Dr. Johnson says, to expect that a great city might be drowned by the overflowing of its kennels. But whatever might be the peril of Watt’s conspiracy, what had Hardy to do with it? The peopk with Watt were five or six persons, w unknown to Hardy, and not members of sny society of which Mr. Hardy was a member; I vow to God, therefore, that I cannot expres what I feel, when I'am: obliged to state the evidence by which he is zpuget to be affected. —A letter, viz. the circular letter signed by Hardy for calling another convention, & shown to George Ross, who says he received it fromr one Stock, who belonged to 2 society which met in Nicholson-street, in Edinburg, and that he sent it to Perth, Strathaves, Paisley, and other places im Scotland; st the single unconnected evidence of iii es lic letter, finding its way into Scotland, is made the foundation of letting in the whok evidence, which hanged Watt, against Hardy. who never knew bim.—Government h: 
ERSKINE 8830 its own spy in Scottand upon that evidence, and it may be sufficient evidence for tht purpose: I will not argue the case of a dead man, and, above all, of such a man; bet! will say, that too much money was spent upen this performance, as I think it cost govemment about fifty thousand pounds
MR_EVANS 8831  M‘Ewsa says, that Watt read from a paper to 8 cea mittee of six or seven people, of whith be, the witness, was a member, that gentlemen, residing in the country, were not to leave their habitations, under pain of death; tht an attack was to be made in the manner you remember, and that the lord: justice Clert, and the judges, were to be cut off by thee men in bos ram; and then an address wat to be sent to the king, desiring him to dw miss his ministers and to put an end to the war, or that he might expect bad consequences. Wuar 18 atu tars To M2. Harpy? How is it possible to affect mm with any part of this? Hear the sequel, then judge for yourselves.—Mr. Watt sit (i. e. the man who is Benge, said), after reading the paper, that he, Watt, wishedcorrespond with Mr. Hardy in a sate manne, —so that because a ruffian and a whom I never saw or heard of, chooses, athe distance of four hundred miles, to sy, that he wishes to correspond with me, 1 am to be involved in the guilt of his actions! It's not proved, or insinuated, that Mr. Hardy ever saw, or heard of, or knew, that sub men were in being as Watt or Downie: oe is it proved, or asserted, that any letter was in fact, written by either of them to Hardy, or to any other person No such letter bs

ERSKINE 8834  warded. gentlemen, I desire to be stood to be making no attacks upon gover ment, I have wished, throughout the whole cause, that good intentions may be imputed to it, but I really confess, that it requires some ingenuity for government to account for the original existence of all this history, and its subsequent application to They went down to Scotland, after the arrest of the prisoners, in order, I suppose, that we might be taught the law of high treason by the lord justice Clerk of Edinburgh, and that there should be a sort of rehearsal to teach the pore of England to administer English ws; for, after all this expense and prepavation, no man was put upon his trial, nor even arraigned under the special commission in Scotland, but these two men; one for the present trial. 
ERSKINE 8835 reading this paper, and the other for not dissenting from it when it was read; and, with regard to this last unfortunate person, the crown thought it indecent, as-it would indeed have been indecent and scandalous, to execute the law upon him; as a gentleman upon his jury said he would die, rather than convict Downie without a recommendation of mercy, and he was only brought over to join in the werdict, under the idca that he would not be executed, and accordingly he has not suffered execution. If Downie, then, was an object of mercy, or rather of justice, though he was the very reom with Watt, and heard disio tinetly the proposition, ground can they demand soner at the bar, on account of a connexion ig what possible with the very same individual, though he never corresponded with him, nor saw him, nor 
ERSKINE 8836 Acard of him,—to whose very being he was an utter stranger ? Gentlemen, it is impossible for me to know what impression this observation makes upon you, or upon the Court; but I 
ERSKINE 8837 acclare Iam deeply impressed with the application of it—How is a man to defend himself against such implications of guilt? — Which of us all would be safe, standing at the bar of God or man, if he were even to answer for all his own expressions, without taking upon him the crimes or rashnesses of others? This poor man has, indeed, none of his own to answer for: yet how can he stand safely in judgment before you, if, in a season ofalarm and agitation, with the whole pressure of government upon him, your minds are to be distracted with criminatiag materials brought from so many quarters, and of an extent which mocks all power of discrimination 
MR_EVANS 8838 I am conscious that I have not adverted to the thousandth part of them; yet I am sinking under fatigue and weakness. I am st this moment scarcely able to stand up whilst I am speaking to you, deprived as I have “been, for nights together, of every thing that deserves the name of rest, repose, or comfort. I, therefore, hasten, whilst yet I may be able, to remind you once again of the great principle into which all I have been saying Sesolves itself. Gentlemen, my whole argument then amounts to no more than this, that before the crime of compassing THe KING's DEATH can be found by you, the jury, whose provinte it is to judge of its existence, it must be believed by you to have existed in point of ‘fact. —Before you can adjudge a Fact, you must believe it—not suspect it—or imagine it, or fancy it,—BUT BELIEVE IT; and it is impossible to impress the human mind with such a reasonable and certain belief, as is necessary to be impressed, before a christian man can adjudge his neighbour to the smallest penalty, much less to the pains of death, without having such evidence as a reasonable mind will accept of, as the infallible test of truth. And what is that evidence ?—Neither more nor less than that which the constitution has established in the courts for the general administration of justice; namely, t the evidence convinces the jury, beyond atl reasonable doubt, that the criminal intention, constituting the crime, existed in the mind of the man upon trial, and was the main spring of his conduct. The rules of evidence, as they are settled by law, and adopted in its general administration, are not to be overruled or tampered with.—They are founded in the charities of religion—in the philosophy of nature—in the truths of history, and in the experience of common life; and whoever ventures rashly to depart from them, let him remember that it will be meted tu him in the same measure, and that both God and man will judge him accurdingly.—These are arguments addressed to your reasons and consciences, not to be shaken in upright minds by any precedent, for no precedents can sanctify injustice; if they could, every human right would long ago have been extinct upon the earth.—If the state trials in bad times are to be searched for precedents, what murders may you not commit; what law of humanity may you not trample upon; what tule of justice may you not violate; and what maxim of wise policy may you not abrogate and confound? If precedents in bad times are to be implicitly followed, why should we have heard any evidence st all? You might have convi without any evibe followed, why should the Lords and Commons have investigated these charges, and the crown have put them into this course of judicial trial? since, without such a trial, and even afler an rieey upon one, they might have attainted all the prisoners by act of parliament; they did so in the case of lord Strafford. There are precedents, therefore, for all such things : but such precedents as could not for a moment survive the times of madness and distraction, which gave them birth, but which, as soon as the spurs of the ae a ee sccasions were blunted, were repealed and| Gentlernen, what we tead of in books makes execrated even by parliaments, which, littlebut a faint impression upon us, coinpared to as I may think of the present, ought not to} what weseepassing under our eyes in the be compared with it: parliaments sitting in| living world.—I remember the people of the darkness of former times,—in the nightanother country, in like manner, contending of freedum,—before the principles of govern-for a renovation of their constitution, somement were developed, and before the consti-timesillegally and Hacslenily but stilldevoted tution became fixed.—The last of these pre-toan honest end; I myse! f saw the people cedents, and all the proceedings uponit, wereof Brabant so contending for the ancient conordered to be taken off the filand burnt, tostitution of the good Duke of Burgundy, the intent that the same might no longer behow was this people dealt by ?—All, who were visible in after ages; an order dictated, noonly contending for their own rights and pridoubt, by a pious tenderness for national ho-vileges, were supposed to be of course disaf nour, and meant as a charitable covering forfected to the Emperor: they were handed the crimes of our fathers.—But it was a sinover to courts constituted for the emergency, against posterity; it was a treason againstas this is, and the Emperor marched his army society,—tor, instead of commanding them tothrough the country till all was peace; but be burnt they should rather have directedsuch peace as there is in Vesuvius, or tna, them to be blazoned in large letters upon thethe very moment before they vomit forth their walls of our courts of justice, that, like thelava, and roll theit conflagrations over the characters decyphered by the prophet of God, devoted habitations of mankind : when the to the Fastern tyrant, they might enlargeFrench approached, the fatal etfects were and blacken in your sights, to terrify yousuddenly seen of a government of constraint from acts of injustice. e and terror; the well-affected were dispirited, In times, when the whole habitable earthand the disaffected inflamed into fury.—At is in a state of change and fluctuation—whenthat thoment the Archduchess fled from Brusdeserts are starting up into civilized empiressels, and the Duke of Saxe-Teschen was sent around you,—and when men, no longer slavesexpress to offer the joyeuse entree so long peto the prejudices of particular countries, muchtitioned for in vain: but the season of concesTess to the abuses of particular governments,Sion was past; the storm blew from ev enlist themselves, like the citizens of an en-quarter, and the throne of Brabant departed lightened world, into whatever communitiesfor ever from the House of Burgundy.

Byitish con tion. My hold of the colonies is in the close affection which grows from common names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges, and equal protection. These are ties which, though light: as air, ate as strong as links of iron. Let the colonies always keep the idea of: their civil rights associated with your government, they will cling and grapple to you, and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them trom their allegiance. But let it be once understood, that your government may be one thing, and their privileges another; that these two things may exist without any mutual relation; the cement is gone; the cohesion is loosened; and every thing hastens to decay and dissolution. As long as you have the wisdom to keep the sovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty, the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith, wherever the chosen race and sons of England worship freedom, they will turn their faces toward you. The more they multiply, the more friends you will have; the more ardently they love liberty, the more perfect will be their obedience. Slavery they can have any where. It is a weed that grows in every soil. They may have it from Spain, they may have it from Prussia. But until you become lost to all feeling of your true interest and your natural dignity, freedom they can have from none but you. This is the commodity of price, of which you have the monopoly. This is the true act of navigation, which binds to you the commerce of the colonies, and through them secures to you the wealth of the warld. Is it not the same virtue which does every thing for us here in England? Do you imagine then, that it is the land-tax act which raises your revenue? that it is the annual vote in the Committee of Supply, which gives you your army? or that it is the Mutiny Bill which inspires it with bravery and discipline? Neo! surely no! It is the love of the people; it is their attachment to their government, from the sense of the deep stake they have in such a: glorious institution, which gives you our army and your navy, and infuses into h that liberal obedience, without which your army would be a base rabble, and your navy nothing but rotten timber. Gentlemen, to conchude. My fervent wish is, that we may not conjure up a spirit to destroy ourselves, nor set the Gemnle here of what in another country we deplore. Let us cherish the old and venerable laws of our forefathers. Let our judicial administration be strict and pure; and let the Jury of the land preserve the life of a fellow-subject, who only asks it from them upon the same terms under which they hold their own lives, and all that is dear to them and their posterity for ever. Let me repeat the wish with whichbegan my address to you, and which proceeds from: the very bottom of my heart ; may it please God, who is the Author of all mercies to mankind, whose providence, I am persuaded, guides and superintends the transactions of the world, and whose guardian spirit has for ever hovered over this prosperous island, to direct and fortify your Pe at I am aware I have not acquitted myself to the unfortunate man, who has put his trust in me, in the manner I could have wished ; yet I am unable to proceed any farther; exhausted in spirit and in strength, but confident in the expectation of justice.—There is one thing more, however, that (if I can) I must state to you, namely, that I will show, by as many witnesses, as it may be found necessary or convenient fur you to hear upon the subject, that the views of the societies were what I have alleged them to be; that whatever irregularities or indiscretions they might have committed, their purposes were honest ; and that Mr. Hardy’s, above all other men, can: be established to have been so. I have, ine deed, an Hunourable Gentleman (Mr. Francis) in my eye, at this moment, to be called hereafter as a witness, who being desirous in his place, as a member of Parliament, to promote an inquiry into the seditious practices complained of, Mr. Hardy offered himself voluntarily to come turward, proffered a sight of all the papers, which were afterwards seized in his custody, and tendered every possible assistance to give satisfaction to the laws of his country, if found to be offended. I will show likewise his character to be religious, temerate, humane, and moderate, and his univ form conduct all that can belong to a good subject, and an honest man.—When you have heard this evidence, it will, beyond all doubt, confirm you in coming to the conclusion which, at such great length (for which I entreat your pardon), I have been eadeavouring to support. 
GIBBS 8839  You were a member, I belicve, of the London Corresponding Society 
MR_EVANS 8840 I was. 
GIBBS 8841 Were you of the same division with the prisoner, Mr. Hardy 
MR_EVANS 8842 Yes; No. 2. 
GIBBS 8843 Did you attend the divisions much 
MR_EVANS 8844 Very regularly. Ido not know that I missed one night ing near two years; itis nearly two years since I belonged to it. 
GIBBS 8845 Is it two years that you have ceased to belong to it
MR_EVANS 8846 No; two years since I first belonged to it, to the presenttime. I ceased to be a member of it when Mr. Hardy was taken up 
GIBBS 8847 You saw Mr. Hardy frequently
MR_EVANS 8848 It was very rarely that he was absent. 
GIBBS 8849 Were youacquainted with him 
MR_EVANS 8850 Perfectly well; Ihave seen bim four, five, or six times a week. I hardly ever missed a Sunday, but I called upon him, either in the course of the day, or in theevening. 
GIBBS 8851 What was his character—a man of a peaceable disposition, or at all inclined to riot or tumult
MR_EVANS 8852 A remarkably peaceable disposition. 
GIBBS 8853 Was he a friend to order 
MR_EVANS 8854 Very much 80; there was an instance of it in the society, at the time we were dispersed from the publichouses ; he desired particularly, when we got to a private house, that no member would even bring a stick with him. 
GIBBS 8855 Then he was a great friend to peace and order 
MR_EVANS 8856 Remarkably so. 
GIBBS 8857 What were the objects of your society 
MR_EVANS 8858 A parliamentary reform; nothing else that I ever heard. 
GIBBS 8859 In what House of parliament did you wish that reform to take place 
MR_EVANS 8860 In’ the House of Commons. 
EYRE 8861 The witness should be told, that there is a question touching the conduct of the society, whether it is highly criminal, or whether it is innocent; the witness understanding that, and being willing to answer, may answer ; but he must understand that, in consequence of his answering the questions, on the part of the prisoner, he will also be liable to be examined on the same points, on the part of the prosecution; and that I cannot then protect him, if any question is put to him that he would wish not to answer, 
GIBBS 8862 I understand so. 
EYRE 8863 Every witness should understand that when he is called. 
GIBBS 8864 We think that every witness that we shall call, will submit to'any crose-examination the crown may choose. 
EYRE 8865 It is right he should be told. 
GIBBS 8866 You will understand, that it will not be an excuse to you, with respect to any question that the attorney general may ask, that an answer will accuse yourself
MR_EVANS 8867 I am not afraid of answering to any thing that I know. 
EYRE 8868 The witness has had a fair notice of the situation he isin ; if oe pioones to subject himself to answer, very weil. 
GIBBS 8869 Youhave said, that the only object of your society was a reform in the House of Commons 
MR_EVANS 8870 Nothing else. 
GIBBS 8871 Was it any part of your views to make any alteration in the House of Lords 
MR_EVANS 8872 None. 
GIBBS 8873 Had you ever any design to make any attack, or to trench at all upon the authority of the crown 
MR_EVANS 8874 No; God forbid. 
GIBBS 8875 You had not 
MR_EVANS 8876 No. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8877 I object to that question ; you should ask him what his object as. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8878 was, 
GIBBS 8879 I understand, and I take the rule from the Court, that a counsel must not putea answer into the mouth of a witness, ie ay laa him to the subject. a asked if they any views loa changein House of Lords. 
EYRE 8880 I apprehend the more correct question would be, what were the views of the society with respect to the House of Lords. 
GIBBS 8881 I will putit so. You said you did wish that there should be a reform in the House of Commons; what were the views of the society with respect to the House of Lords
MR_EVANS 8882 None. Z 
GIBBS 8883 What were the views of the society with respect to the authority of the Crown 
MR_EVANS 8884 None. 
GIBBS 8885 You told me you were intimately acquainted with Mr. Hardy, did he converse with you often upon political subjects 
MR_EVANS 8886 Frequently. 
GIBBS 8887 If he had had any views different from a do you think you should have known 
MR_EVANS 8888 I think I should, for curiosity often led me to ask him a number of questions. 
GIBBS 8889 Had you any reason, from any conversation that you ever had with him, to think that his views were different from yours; that be had any views either upon the House of Lords er the King 
MR_EVANS 8890 No; certainly not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8891 I object to that question. 
ERSKINE 8892 Are you afraid of the question. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8893 I will not have the question put in that form; I am afraid of questions that ought not to be put. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8894 I am afraid of pe pete that ought to be put, but of questions ought not to be put. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8895  ‘saan 
ERSKINE 8896 I don't understand you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8897 I think you would not have made the observation if you did. 
ERSKINE 8898 I still less understand you now, and am surprised, I own. 
EYRE 8899 What is the question that ae think there is any doubt about ; letus know what the question is, and the Court will give their assistance towards mediating. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 8900 The attorney general objected, because the question was not put ia the proper style. 
EYRE 8901 I do not exactly, at this moment, know to what it pointed ; it escaped me. 
GIBBS 8902 I believe I had better go on with the examination. You tell me you never collected, from Mr. Hardy, that he had any different views from those that you had 
MR_EVANS 8903 No. 
GIBBS 8904 Did Mr. Hardy ever produce, at the division meeting of your society, any letter, that he received from Sheffield, about pikes
MR_EVANS 8905 No; never. 
GIBBS 8906 Did he ever communicate it to you
MR_EVANS 8907 Never. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8908 That Gentleman asked you whether Mr. Hardy had ever communicated to you that letter from Sheffield, you immediately said no. Now I should be glad to ask you how you knew what letter it was that that gentleman alluded to—what is the letter that you mean to speak of, when you say Hardy never comsnunicated it to you 
GODDARD 8909 The Stiefheld letter. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8910 I should be glad to know what Sheffield letter you mean 
GODDARD 8911 I do not know. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8912 The witness overheard that. ‘ 
GIBBS 8913 I asked, in the examination in chief, whether the letter, relating to pikes, had been read; I putin those terms; I do aver, upon my veracity, that did; and I will not have that contradicted. 
EYRE 8914 It is time for me to interpose, and not to suffer these things to pass at. the table. I agree that you did ask the question in that manner, because I have taken itso; but I also agree, that you ought not to interrupt the cross-examination ; they will put their questions in such manner as they please, and you will setit right, if they 
EYRE 8915 ‘ put it wrong, when you come to re-examine the witness ; there ought not to be any breaking in upon one another, because one gentlethinks that another gentleman did not put the question in the manner he put it; he 
EYRE 8916 “puts the question in the manner he understands the gentleman put it. 
GIBBS 8917 Because there was a direct contradiction to the fact. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8918 I must entreat your lordships to ms and I hold it to be m duty to do it. There is a gentleman who is not counsel in the cause, who sits next Mr. Gibbs, and when I asked the witness the queetion, what letter it was, I heard him in this part of the Court, asI believe some other gentlemen did, say, “ The letter about pikes. Now Ido not mean to say, and I desire in justice to that gentleman to observe, that I do not mean to say, by any means that he intended the witness should hear that explanation given to Mr. Gibbs; I do not believe it; I therefore disavow that; but I must desire that no gentleman should sit next the counsel for the defendant, or the counsel for the crown, who under, not the colour, I will not. use that word, but under the fact of commuNicating and conversing with the defendant’s counsel, should, in point of fact, lead, I do not mean to say in point of intention—the witness to giving an answer which he could not have given. 
VAUGHAN 8919 I presume, my lord, as I have been personally alluded to, may be permitted to speak. I assure the attorney general, and the whole court, upon my honour, that [had none of the intentions, nor would have been guilty of the fact which he imputes to me; and the only circumstance which induced me to make one single observation is this—that Mr. Erskine and Mr. Gibbs did me the honour to desire that I would sit next them, because some months ago I was consulted upon the subject of this trial ; that being the case, many circumstances might occur to my recollection with which they might not be acquainted. 
EYRE 8920 There can be no objection at all; the Court will certainly not interpose to prevent your sitting next the Counsel who are assigned for the prisoner, and giving them .any assistance that your partiticular knowledge may enable you to give them; at the same time that situation is a delicate one, and you will undoubtedly take particular care to avoid any thing that may give any ground to any man alive to suppose you donot make a correct useof it. I do not suppose you do otherwise, I have not taken any notice of your conduct that authorizes me to make any objection to it; but if you said any thing loud enough to be taken notice of by the witness, you were not so correct as you should have been. 
VAUGHAN 8921 I certainly would not, my lord. If the Attorney general desires, I will remove to any other part of the court. 
EYRE 8922 I do not desire you should, for if you can, though not assigned counsel for the prisoner, by your particular knowledge, be of any use to his 
EYRE 8923 Counsel, the Court have no objection to your giving any sort of communication you can possibly give. 
EYRE 8924 Mr. Attorney General.I heard said as distinctly as I bear myself, when I put the question, “ the letter about the pikes, 
EYRE 8925 I had really taken down the answer of the witness before any part of this conversation arose—“ that de had never heard of any letter from Sheftield about pikes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8926 tow long have you been a member of this society 
GODDARD 8927 Nearly two years. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8928 — are of the division No. 2, I understand
GODDARD 8929 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8930 Who introduced you into this society 
GODDARD 8931 A brother of mine. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8932 Where does he live?i—He did live at No. 27, in Pall-Mall? he is removed to Horsedown. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8933 Were you at the Globe-tavern on the 20th of January 1794 
GODDARD 8934 I was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8935 Were you at Chalk Farm upon the 14th of April 
GODDARD 8936 I was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8937 Being at the Globe tavern upon the 20th of January, 1794, am I to understand you to say, that nothing passed there but what was quite peaceable and right, according to your notion 
GODDARD 8938 Every thing was very peaceable, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8939 Did you ever see a printed account of what passed there
GODDARD 8940 Yes; there were some resolutions. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8941 Which were afterwards printed 
GODDARD 8942 I was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8943 Were the resolutions that you saw in print a correct account of what really did pass there
GODDARD 8944 I think they were. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8945 Then that being a correct account of what did pass upon the 20th of January 1794, you mean to state to the Court and the Jury that the proceedings, as contained in that printed paper, were according to your ideas correct und poate and according 1o the law of the Jand, as you understand 
GODDARD 8946 I understood 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8947 Tt so, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8948 You said you were at Chalk Farm 
GODDARD 8949 I was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8950 And you also mean to state as far as your opinion goes, that the proccedings at ChalkFarm were exactly what they really ought to be
GODDARD 8951 I thought so. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8952 Perhaps you were at the meeting in Breillat'’s yard when delegates were chosen to be sent to Scotland 
GODDARD 8953 I was not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8954 Not being there, perhaps you did not know the fact that a delegate was sent to the convention in Scotland 
GODDARD 8955 Yes, I did. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8956 Knowing the fact, you approved of that measure, I suppose 
GODDARD 8957 Yes—I never was in office, but I used regularly to attend. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8958 Did you ever hoar of the Secret Committee in your society 
GODDARD 8959 Yes, I have heard of it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8960 ‘ ‘Then having -heard of the Secret Com:mittec, do you happen to know who the Secret Committee were composed of 
GODDARD 8961 That I never did. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8962 ‘Bless me! you were a member of the Corresponding Society, which had a Secret Com:mittee; all their transactions were peaceable, and yet you do not know who the Secret Committee were 
GODDARD 8963 No, I do not—I will say every thing I know. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8964 Every answer that you have given to me yet proves to me that you are an honest man. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8965 This society, whose proceedings wer feqeobl, had a Secret Committee 
GODDARD 8966 The at 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8967 Was it known among the body in genen! who the Secret Committee were 
GODDARD 8968 I do mn think it was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8969 ‘Then youmean to say, giving this characte of the proceedings of this society, that ya remained in the society; there being a secret committee of persons whose names you dd not know, of course you did not know whit were the proceedings of any committee, the names of which committee you did ma know 
GODDARD 8970 I did not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8971 When the prisoner and some ether peopk were apprehended, do not you know thst there was another Secret Committee formec
GODDARD 8972 I never attended afterwards, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8973 Do not you know that there was anothe: Secret Comunittee formed 
GODDARD 8974 I do sot knowit 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8975 You have heard it in your divisions
GODDARD 8976 I never attended a division afterwards. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8977 You left the society afterwards 
GODDARD 8978 I left th society. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8979 Of course, when there was that suspicaco about the society, you did nos choose tw ca tinue any longer 
GODDARD 8980 I did nat. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8981 Who were your delegates to the Scotch Seavennots 
GODDARD 8982 Mr. Margarot and Mr. Ge
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8983 Were you in the society, think you, before the 6th of August 1792
GODDARD 8984 No; I was int society two years within a month. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8985 I hope you bave seen the address of the 6th of August, 1792
GODDARD 8986 I have, may be, bet 1 cannot recollect it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8987 You do pot know any thing of the contest: of it
GODDARD 8988 I do not; it is not in my memory now, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8989 You say you know nothing at all about th Sheffield letter 
GODDARD 8990 No. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8991 Did you ever hear of a circular Jetter that wey sent into Scotland to call a conventian
GODDARD 8992 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8993 Who carried it into Scotland 
GODDARD 8994 I do not know. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8995 Do you know a person of the name of Stock 
GODDARD 8996 I do not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8997 Hecollent yourself
GODDARD 8998 I do pot upon my oath. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8999 How did the printed circular letter, with the name of T. Hardy at the bottom of it, get into Scotland upon your oath 
GODDARD 9000 It was seat I presume. 
EYRE 9001 How 
GODDARD 9002 I do not know. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9003 How do you kaow that it was sent there
GODDARD 9004 I do not know. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9005 In point of fact, did you ever hear whether that circular letter went or not
GODDARD 9006 It might or might not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9007 hat is no answer, so might 1; 1 might or might not, but, in point of tact, did you ever hear whether that circular letter ever went
GODDARD 9008 It might or might not. 
EYRE 9009 But the question is, have you heard it or not
GODDARD 9010 I might have heard it, but I cannot recollect the circumstance. 
EYRE 9011 I have taken it down, that you heard ot a circular letter which went into Scotland 
GODDARD 9012 I heard it went down into Scotland. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9013 Where did you hear that 
GODDARD 9014 At the division. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9015 Did you hear any thing what this circular letier was about, what were the contents of it
GODDARD 9016 To call a convention; I cannot repeat any thing of it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9017 You consider all the proceedings at the Globe-tavern on the 20th of January, and also the proceedings at Chalk Farm, as in your opinion, quite peaceable and constitutional proceedings 
GODDARD 9018 I thought so. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9019 That is your notion of the matter
GODDARD 9020 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9021 You sing some songs now and then in your society do not you 
GODDARD 9022 Never in the society, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9023 How came you never te sing them in the socicty 
GODDARD 9024 I know not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9025 Is it done on purpose, or how happens that
GODDARD 9026 I know not, we were a very peaceable suciety, songs were not in general introduced atall. ‘ 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9027 I hope you do not mean to say that there were no songs sung at your dinner
GODDARD 9028 There were songs then. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9029 Did you never hear of a very good song, called “ God save the Rights of Man 
GODDARD 9030 I have heard of such a sung. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9031 Perhaps you sung it sometimes yourself
GODDARD 9032 Never. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9033 Can you tell us what the contents of itare 
GODDARD 9034 I cannot repeat a verse, or a line, or a syllable. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9035 Perhaps you could inform me if you were to see it
GODDARD 9036 I could read it if I saw it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9037 Did you ever heat of a song that has this chorus : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9038  Plant, plant the tree, fair freedom’s tree, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9039 “ "Midst dangers, wounds, and slaughter, Fach Patriot’s breast its soil shall be, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9040 “ And Tyrant’s bluod its water. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9041 Do you recollect that song
GODDARD 9042 You know more of it than I do—I have heard of such a song. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9043 You have heard this song sung, you say, “Plant, plant the tree?’ —I cannot say, upon my recollection, that I ever have heard it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9044 Then how came you to tell me you had heard something about “ Plant, plant the tree 
GODDARD 9045 I have heard there were a number of songs; I do not know that I ever heard it sung, but I may. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9046 When I asked you, and I appeal to the Court and the Jury, if ever you heard a song, the chorus of which was “ Plant, plant the tree—you said yes
GODDARD 9047 I have heard there were such songs. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9048 Did not you tell me you had heard that particular sung
GODDARD 9049 I beg your pardon, I did not tell you su. 
EYRE 9050 You certainly gaid you had heard the song, “ Plant, plant the tree."
GODDARD 9051  I have heard there was such a song, but I never heard it. 
EYRE 9052 You are quite at liberty to explain, but you did say that you had heard the song, “ Plant, plant the tree
GODDARD 9053 I have; but I have said I never heard the gong in the society, and there were a number of songs sung, there was a man that did attend the society with songs, a pack of idle songs, and we would not sutfer him tu attend the place. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9054 How many songs of Mr. Thelwall’s have you ever seen, or had in your possession 
GODDARD 9055 ] have had them all, but I thought there was no harm in Mr. Thelwall’s songs. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9056 Then you mean to swear you think there was no harm in Mr. Thelwall’s songs
GODDARD 9057 I thought there was no harm in them when they were sold in public shops. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9058 Do you mean to swear that you thought there was no harm in Mr. Thelwall’s songs
GODDARD 9059 Yes, 1 do not think there was in those’ that I saw, J do not know what songs he may have wrote. , 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9060 Be so good as tell us the names of some of Mr. Thelwall’s songs, as you have all of them 
GODDARD 9061 I do not know what all of them is. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9062 Tell us the name of some of them 
GODDARD 9063 There’ was one very long one, I cannot recollect the title of it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9064 You have all of Mr. Thelwall’s songs, but you cannot tell the title of one of them 
GODDARD 9065 I do not know how many songs he wrote, there were threc of Mr. Thclwall’s songs ; I do not koow what you mean by all. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9066 They were printed all upon one sheet of paper, I believe 
GODDARD 9067 They were sold publicly. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9068 And dispersed all over the country, were they not 
GODDARD 9069 I cannot tell; upon my oath I do not know that they were dispersed any where. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9070 Tfave you those songs in your possession
GODDARD 9071 I have. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9072 What were the titles of them
GODDARD 9073 I cannot recollect the titles. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9074 Look at this paper, read a part of that song, and tell me whether thatis one? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9075 Goddard
GODDARD 9076 Which song do you mean? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9077 “ God save the Rights of Man
GODDARD 9078 Jt might or might not, E cannot say. 
ERSKINE 9079 Is your lordship’s time to be’ consumed about this gentleman’s opinion upon asong? ; 
EYRE 9080 If the song is proved to have been sung in the society, then itis competent to ask whether that song is peaceable; but unless the song is proved to have been sung there 
EYRE 9081 Goddard
GODDARD 9082 I never heard this song sung there. 
EYRE 9083 He has said that all the proceedings there were peaceable and orderly ; then if this song is proved to have been sung there, there certainly can be no. impropriety in asking him whether, according to his judgment, that proceeding was peaceable and orderly, but it is not proved that it was sung there. 
ERSKINE 9084 But it is not proved that it was either sung or said there. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9085  Look at that and tell me whether that was printed by order of the Corresponding Society, or not
GODDARD 9086 Not as I know of. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9087 Had you ever a paper of that sort in your jhand
GODDARD 9088 Not as I can recollect, and I would recoltect if 1 conld; as I told you, I never was-in office, but F regularly attended. 
GIBBS 9089  Were you a member of the London Corresponding Society
GODDARD 9090 Yes. 
GIBBS 9091 Of that division of which Mr. Hardy was a member
GODDARD 9092 Yes. 
GIBBS 9093 What was the object of the society 
GODDARD 9094 To obtain a parliamentary reform. 
GIBBS 9095 In what part of parliament 
GODDARD 9096 In the House of Commons. 
GIBBS 9097 ue you sny other object but that
GODDARD 9098 No -other. 
GIBBS 9099 What did you mean with-respect to the King, or the House of Lords 
GODDARD 9100 We had no thoughts of them ; a reform in parliament was all that we wanted. 
GIBBS 9101 And im have said, by parliament you Meant the House of Commons 
GODDARD 9102 The House of Commons. 
GIBBS 9103 Did you: entertain any other idea yourself but that ofa reform in the House of Commons 
GODDARD 9104 No other. 
GIBBS 9105 Had you any idea of opposing the government by force 
GODDARD 9106 No. 
GIBBS 9107 Had you any intention of doing that? — 
GIBBS 9108 “None. 
GIBBS 9109 Have you seen the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Hardy, there often 
GODDARD 9110 Yes. 
GIBBS 9111 ‘ Did you ever find, from conversation with hin, that be had any such intention
GODDARD 9112 Quite the contrary. 
GIBBS 9113 What was his character—that of a peaceable, orderly man, or the contrary
GODDARD 9114 A peaceable, orderly, and a pious man. 
GIBBS 9115 Were you one of the London Correspond

GODDARD 9117 Yes. 
GIBBS 9118 What was your object in calling that con
GIBBS 9119 ‘vention ; what was it to de
GODDARD 9120 To appoint a number of delegates to take the sense of different divisions, as to obtaining, by the best means, 3 reform in the House of Commons. 
GIBBS 9121 Was it any part of your intention that this convention should proceed by force
GODDARD 9122 No, nor do I believe it was the intention of any man. 
GIBBS 9123 Francis Dowling cross-examined by Mr. Attorney General. How long have you been a member of this society 
DOWLING 9124 About two years and a half. What division did you belong to?—No. 2. 
GIBBS 9125 Did Mr. Hardy ever produce at the division, when you were there, a letter from Sheffield about pikes
DOWLING 9126 I never saw it in my life.

ATTORNEYGENERAL 9262 Do you mean to say that sticking these bills up at night, and the proceedings, such as they were at Chalk Farm, are peaceable and orderly proceedings
DOWLING 9263 I do not know that there is ay thing criminal in sticking up a' 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9264 pends upon the contents of the, bill; and as to the proceedings at Chalk Farm, 1 do not know every word that was said there. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9265 You mean to say that the proceedings were orderly and peaceable
DOWLING 9266 The geueral conduct of the people was very orderly and peaceable. 
EYRE 9267 Did you say you were at Chalk Farm 
DOWLING 9268 Yes. 
EYRE 9269 Were the resolutions there put to the question
DOWLING 9270 I believe they were. 
EYRE 9271 Did you vote for them 
DOWLING 9272 There are only a few peuple, probably, who attend tu the business; out of the great number that attend, it depends, probably, upon those who have abilities, and attend more to those things than a person of my capacity probably dues. 
EYRE 9273 Did you vote for them
DOWLING 9274 I dare say I did among the rest. 
EYRE 9275 Do you vote for things without knowing what they are 
DOWLING 9276 There 1s po man but what is fallible in that respect; 1 might have done 50. 
EYRE 9277 Do not you see what difficulties you might bring yourself into, by concurring in things without knowing what they are? were you ear enough to hear what they were 
DOWLING 9278 I was ata considerable distance. 
EYRE 9279 How did you vote

GIBBS 9289 What were the objccts of the society
DOWLING 9290 Parliamentary retorm. 
GIBBS 9291 A reform in what part of parliament 
DOWLING 9292 In the House of Commons. 
GIBBS 9293 What were your intentions as to any other part of parliament, as to the King, or the Lords
DOWLING 9294 Full of respect, and honour, and fidelity. 
GIBBS 9295 Then your intention was only to work a reformation in the House of Commons 
DOWLING 9296 Solely. 
GIBBS 9297 Had you any reason to think that any other members of the society intended any thing else
DOWLING 9298 Never. 
GIBBS 9299 Was it the intention of any member of the society to bring this about by force
DOWLING 9300 Never to my knowledge. 
GIBBS 9301 Would you have continued in the society, if you had found they had any such intentions 
DOWLING 9302 Not fora moment. 
GIBBS 9303 Were yuu at the socicty when the resolutions concerning a convention passed 
DOWLING 9304 No; I have not been at the society for more than a year and a half. 
GIBBS 9305 “Was there any reason for your absenting yoursell
DOWLING 9306 No; I had nothing upon my conscience to deter me from being a member; but I had not an Spparstalty of being there from my avocations leading me another way. 
GIBBS 9307 Was it merely from your avocations leading you another way
DOWLING 9308 Entirely so. 
GIBBS 9309 How long have you known Mr. Hardy
DOWLING 9310 I have never had the pleasure of knowing him but from his making me a pair of boots, and seeing him as secretary. He made mes pair of boots very excellent and cheap. 
GIBBS 9311 Is he a good inember of society trom what you have heard
DOWLING 9312 IJnever heard but that be was, 
BOWER 9313 What may your business, or profession be
WILLS 9314 A dancing-master. 
BOWER 9315 Were you a member of the Constitational Society 
WILLS 9316 Yes. 
BOWER 9317 You were a member of both societies
WILLS 9318 Yes. 
BOWER 9319 When were you elected a member of the Corresponding Society? —I imagine better than two years ago. 
BOWER 9320 How long have you belonged to the Constitutional Society 
WILLS 9321 Soon atter 1 became a member of the Corresponding Society, I wished to be a members of the Constitutional Society from a wish to hear clever men speak, not having it in my power to go to the IJouse of Parliament, where I could have heard more clever men undoubtedly. 
BOWER 9322 You heard several men speak upon politics? —I have heard several very clever speeches. 
BOWER 9323 Were they clever speeches by clever men
WILLS 9324 You must judge whether they were clever speeches. 
BOWER 9325 Did they strike you as clever speeches from clever men
WILLS 9326 I heard one or two, I thought clever speeches, 
BOWER 9327 You took up your idea of politics from them 
WILLS 9328 I took my rule of politics from public report, and from the debates in both Houses of Parliament. 
BOWER 9329 You did not go to these societies to read the public papers, or to read the debates in both Houses of Parliament 
WILLS 9330 I had not time in general to read the public papers. 
BOWER 9331 Which way then did you get your informa tion? 
BOWER 9332 Wills —What information ? 
BOWER 9333 Mr. Bower—Upon politics; you said ie went there not having an Spron aay of attending both Houses of Parliament 
WILLS 9334 I did Mot say that; I said I went there to hear clever men speak. 
BOWER 9335 Upon what subject
WILLS 9336 Upon any ‘subjects. 
BOWER 9337 Were any subjects discussed that did not relate to politics 
WILLS 9338 I never heard one to my knowledge. 
BOWER 9339 Upon your oath, when you went there, did you expect to hear arly discussion upon any subject but politics
WILLS 9340 It was called the Constitutional Society. 
BOWER 9341 That is no answer to my question; wha you went there, you said, you went there because you had no opportunity of attending the Houses of parliament, and went to hear clever then speak; upon what subject did you gu expecting to hear them speak 
WILLS 9342 Upon constitutional subjects. 
BOWER 9343 And those only 
WILLS 9344 Those only. 
BOWER 9345 Was that the place where you took up your constitutional doctrine 
WILLS 9346 Long before that. 
BOWER 9347 From the newspapers 
WILLS 9348 Sometimes I have had the honour of being in the honourable House of Commons to hear the debates. 
BOWER 9349 And you went to the Constitutional Society not having opportunities to attend the House of Commons, to supply that defect
WILLS 9350 Not to supply that defect merely, but to hear different political subjects discussed. 
BOWER 9351 You had no other means of supplying the information 
WILLS 9352 Not any that I thought better. 
BOWER 9353 Did you attend frequently
WILLS 9354 You may be better informed than I am. 
BOWER 9355 I know nothing.—I ask you
WILLS 9356 I never kept any minutes of my attendance there. 
BOWER 9357 Did you not, upon your oath, attend them weekly 
WILLS 9358 When I could, I did; and might for a month together when 1 could; but I cannot be upon my oath to say, that I did attend them weekly ; I was happy to attend them weekly when I could. 
EYRE 9359 You mean you attended them as often as you could 
WILLS 9360 Yes. 
BOWER 9361  Were youatall acquainted with the proceedings of the society —Very little ; Tnever looked into their books. 
BOWER 9362 Then you did not know of any of their transactions which might bring some of them, or those they employed, into difficulties No, 
BOWER 9363 You never knew that any body was prosecuted fur assisting them in their views
WILLS 9364 Never. 
BOWER 9365 Did you never hear of one William Carter
WILLS 9366 Never. 
BOWER 9367 Then, of course, you never heard that he was in cunfinement at all
WILLS 9368 Stay, Mr. Counsel, give me leave to say, I was in company with a Mr. Carter, musician, at the London coffee house. 
BOWER 9369 Do you recollect Carter, the bill sticker 
WILLS 9370 Tam not, in a moment, to be told that I recollect such a man if I do not; I heard of such a man, that he was in prison (I never saw him In prison) for sticking upa posting bill.—You asked me iff knew such aman? I do not; T heard of him. 
BOWER 9371 You heard nothing more of him but that there was such a man
WILLS 9372 I heard there was. 
BOWER 9373 That is all. You never heard that there was a subscription entered into for him
WILLS 9374 Yes ; perhaps, I gave him a shilling, or halfa-crown, or a guilica, or five guineas, towards his relief, in confinement ; but I do not know that I did to maintain himin his confinement. Idid not recollect the name of Carter any More than I do your's. 
BOWER 9375 That is then what you now mean to swear distinctly, for I will not let you now go back ? Ido not say I gave two guineas, or five, but 
BOWER 9376 T only say I subscribed something, perhaps, to the poor man’s family. 
BOWER 9377 Did not vou say two or five guineas
WILLS 9378 I often give five guineas without knowing to whom I give it. 
BOWER 9379 Did you not, a minute ago, say you might: have given a shilling, or half-a-crown, or a guinea, or five guineas, to this man, in confinement, for sticking up bills
WILLS 9380 I did not say so, tothe man for sticking up bills. 
BOWER 9381 Your gestures will not do 
WILLS 9382 You seem to wish to confuse me. 
BOWER 9383 Ido not wish to confuse you ; the more distinct you give your answer the better; do you mean to say, upon your oath, that you did not recollect when you said, you might have given one, two, or five guineas to this man 
WILLS 9384 I did not mean to say, I had given one, two, or five guineas, but I might have given half-a-crown. 
BOWER 9385 Did you give one, two, or five guineas 
WILLS 9386 I say, Idid not; I might give a few shillings ; I give shillings, as much as you do halfpence, to any poor man that wants it. 
BOWER 9387 Then, I understand, you now swear dis-: tinctly, you might give this man a shilling; but that you did not give him five guineas 
WILLS 9388 N o 
BOWER 9389 Upon your oath, you did not give this man two guineas, or five guineas
WILLS 9390 No; I cannot recollect what I gave him. ’ 
BOWER 9391 You never gave him a guinea, or five gui-. neas
WILLS 9392 Not to my recollection. 
BOWER 9393 Did you ever give him any thing 
WILLS 9394 I do not recollect; I often give to poor men and women indistress. I gave a hundred and fifty pounds to the British fishery, when I thought my country in distress. 
BOWER 9395 Task you, whether you did, or not, subscribe any sum of money to the man who was in confinement, for sticking up bills for the society, and on that account
WILLS 9396 I gave, I believe, to the best of my recollection, sumething, but what I cannot tell. 
BOWER 9397 To whom did you give something 
WILLS 9398 That I do not know. 
BOWER 9399 Who asked you for it
WILLS 9400 In some of the societies, which, and where, I do not know. 
BOWER 9401 What societies 
WILLS 9402 The Corresponding Societies. 
BOWER 9403 At the time you gave that, was a subscription put about for the relief of this man so in custody 
WILLS 9404 There must have been a mention of itor I should not have known it; but Ido not recollect in what manner. 
BOWER 9405 Did you attend one, or more of theee s0cieties 
WILLS 9406 One. 
BOWER 9407 Which was that
WILLS 9408 The London Corresponding Society. 
BOWER 9409 At which house 
WILLS 9410 At Proctor’s, in Covent Garden. 
BOWER 9411 Was it there you subscribed
WILLS 9412 No ; it was, I believe, in Compton-street, if I recollect right; the last time I was at any of those s0cieties. 
BOWER 9413 Was Compton-street a place where the delegates met, or a division meeting Among the divisions, I believe; I did not belong to any delegate society, but to the common meeting. 
BOWER 9414 Which division of the society did you belong to
WILLS 9415 Proctor’s, No. 2, Covent Garden; this was, I think, No. 31, Compton-street. 
BOWER 9416 Did you go there as a visitor 
WILLS 9417 I believe I moust have been a member of that. 
BOWER 9418 You are now a member of the Covent Garden division 
WILLS 9419 Yes. 
BOWER 9420 Then, whether you have been a member of that in Compton-street, you do not know 
WILLS 9421 Itis the same thing; not a separate society. 
BOWER 9422 The same division 
WILLS 9423 A separate division. 
BOWER 9424 My question is, whether you belonged to one, or two divisions of this society 
WILLS 9425 To more than one; I think to another; I think 37. 
BOWER 9426 Did you belong to more than two
WILLS 9427 I am not sure of that; if I belonged to ten, I should own it with pleasure. 
BOWER 9428 When you werein the society, did you know any thing of any secret committee; perhaps a never heard of any such thing 
WILLS 9429 I never id. Did you ever hear of the committee of correspondence?—Never. I have heard of it since, Not in the society ; I have not been in the society since such a thing has been mentioned. 
BOWER 9430 Of course you know nothing of any secret committee 
WILLS 9431 Never. 
BOWER 9432 Ifa secret committee had been mentioned, it would have been to you a matter of surrise 
WILLS 9433 I do not understand you; I never Beard of a secret committee of the society in my life. 
BOWER 9434 Did you ever hear of any letter that had been written by the prisoner —Never. 
GIBBS 9435  You had heard that there was a man in custody who was in distress
WILLS 9436 I had. 
GIBBS 9437 Did you, at that time, know the man’s name 
WILLS 9438 I recollect it now; I did not, when the learned judge spoke to me, recollect that there was such a man in being. 
GIBBS 9439 Was he represented to you as an object in distress 
WILLS 9440 In real distress. 
GIBBS 9441 And for that man so imprisoned, and so in distress, did you subscribe any money 
WILLS 9442 I did, but what sum I cannot tell; I cannot charge my memory whether it was a shilling, a guinea, or half-a-guinea. 
GIBBS 9443 What was your reason for saying, just now, that you perhaps subscribed a guinea, or two guineas, or five guineas
WILLS 9444 Becausc I would as soon give the one as the other, for a poor family, of individual, in distress. 
EYRE 9445 You have brought rself into a scrape, only for the sake of a lourish, When you are upon your oath, if you would only speak plain English, you would be under no difficulty ; there is a great difference between a shilling and a guinea, and five guineas, therefore you should not have conveyed an idea that you did not know whether you gave one shilling, two shillings, one’ 
EYRE 9446 guinea, or five guineas. I would advise you, when you are upon your oath, never to by metaphor ; you have brought yourself into aevelties but I dare say you meant very right. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9447 I beg your lortship will ask him what he gave. 
EYRE 9448 How much did you give, in plain English
WILLS 9449 Perhaps a few shillings, perhaps half-a-crown. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9450 Will your lordship please to ask him if it was not a guinea. 
EYRE 9451 Do you say it was not a guineaf—A tew shillings, to the best of my knowledge. 
EYRE 9452 Under, or about five shillings
WILLS 9453 ] suppose under. 
GIBBS 9454 I will now call-a gentleman at the bar, who says he knows this witness perfectly well, and that he is a man of goud cha racter. 
EYRE 9455 That is perfectly irregular. It was certainly absurd in the witness not to recollect that he was upon his cath, and to talk in that rhodomontade way. I dare say he meant to speak the truth. 
GIBBS 9456  Were you a member of either of those secieties Which society do you mean ? 
GIBBS 9457 Either the society for Constitutional Information, or the London Corresponding Society
WILLS 9458 I was a member of the London Corresponding Society, for, I think, about twenty months, 
GIBBS 9459 Do you know Mr. Hardy, the prisoner 
WILLS 9460 Yes: I do know him.

GIBBS 9463 What was the object of your society 
WILLS 9464 Toobtain a parliamentary reform. 
GIBBS 9465 In which House of parliament
WILLS 9466 TIo the House of Commons most assuredly; I never understood any thing else. 
GIBBS 9467 What were your intentions towards the king, or towards the House of Lords 
WILLS 9468 Thatthey should remain as they are, certainly ; Inever understood any thing else. 
GIBBS 9469 Was it the intention of any of the members of the society, that you know, to bri about this parliamentary reform by force o arms
WILLS 9470 No, there was never-any thing of the, kind agitated, that know of. 
GIBBS 9471 Youknow nothing of any such intention
WILLS 9472 Most assuredly I do not; I never heard any thing like force of arms out of the reports of the secret committee of the House of Com mons; I have read them attentively ; I never heard of any force of arms out of those reports; I have heard it reported there. ’ 
GIBBS 9473 Was it the intention of any of the members of the society, whom you know, to make any, stink upon the goverstment of the countsy
WILLS 9474 No. 
GIBBS 9475 It was not

HUNTER 9523 As far as I could collect them, they were so. 
LAW 9524 You have said, you heard the resolutions carried at Chalk-farm—were they peaceable
HUNTER 9525 I have not said that I heard them. 
LAW 9526 Did you hear them, or not; I understood you said you did hear them
HUNTER 9527 I heard them read, but I did not attend to them. 
LAW 9528 Did you vote for them, or no
HUNTER 9529 I did not. 
LAW 9530 How came it that you did not vote for them

LAW 9551 And had you forgot what business you were; were not you a hair-dresser 
HUNTER 9552 Yes. 
LAW 9553 Had you forgotten that circumstance, when I asked you just now 
HUNTER 9554 I thought a perfumer was sufficient. 
LAW 9555 But you said, it was so long ago since you were in business, that you did not know what business you followed: how long is it since you have done business as a hair-dresser 
HUNTER 9556 I think it is, since I followed the business of a hair-dresser, about twelve years, to the best of my recollectien ; I am not quite sure. 
LAW 9557 And how long since you followed the business of a perfumer
HUNTER 9558 At the same time, 
LAW 9559 Did you cease to be both at the same time
HUNTER 9560 Yes. 
LAW 9561 About twelve years ago
HUNTER 9562 I would not swear, upon my oath, to the time; but it is thereabouts. 
LAW 9563 Then having this perfect recollection that you have been a perfumer and a hair-dresser, about twelve years ago, how came you to tell me it was so long ago, you did not recollect what business you bad carried on 
HUNTER 9564 I did not say that, 
EYRE 9565 What he said was, that it was so long ago since he carried on any business, he could not recollect what business he followed.

HUNTER 9586 I never did, and never could, 
GIBBS 9587 Did you ever collect, from any of them, that it was their intent to produce a reform by violence

GIBBS 9595 What is his character
HUNTER 9596 An unblemished character, I always thought so.

GIBBS 9622 During the whole of this time, the seve: years he lived with you, and the three yeas since, duriug which you have known hin, what character has he borne 
FRASER 9623 A very gow character.

GIBBS 9634 Have you known Mr. Hardy, the prisoner
FRASER 9635  I have known Mr. Hardy, the prisoner, for about four years, between three and far years; I accidentally got acquainted with Mr. Hardy by stopping at a house during ashore ofrain; I fell into his company, and at til time I found him very agreeable. 
GIBBS 9636 I will not lead you into that sort of count of him; what I want to know of yous. you say you have known him between thre and four years; what character has he boro: during that time
FRASER 9637 I will speak, if you give me leave, a few words, very short. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9638 I have no object to what the gentleman pleases to say
FRASER 9639 Fine ing Mr. Hardy very agreeable in conversato?, and speaking like a very serious man, Ii quired hig address; he told me at No.?, Piccadilly, and told me he should be gladsee me; I called on him there, and request) in my calls, we have talked on religiow sabjects, and sometimes on political subjects;aone time Mr. Hardy showed me a papet which his name was affixed, some res ed with the teausactigns of the socicty —No of the London Corresponding Society; 548 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9640 mediately asked him the intent, or ultimate end and design that this society had in view, and he told me it was a reform of parliament, that is to say, of the House of Commons, upon eaceable and constitutional principles; he farther added upon the same principles which his grace the duke cof Richmond and the right hon. William Pitt were engaged in, in the year 1782. I have frequently, in conversation, inquired of him, and tried to suck out, to gain what was the inteut of the society, when I heard something about these reports of the Committee of the House of Commons, and so on, and he told me by all means it was to obtain a parliamentary reform upon constitutional principles, in a peaceable manner. 
EYRE 9641 Since the report
FRASER 9642 Yes. 
EYRE 9643 Where did you see him 
FRASER 9644  At his own house. 
EYRE 9645 Since the report
FRASER 9646 Yes; since the report. 
EYRE 9647 Recollect yourself
FRASER 9648 I saw Mr. Hardy at his own house, it was in the summer, I believe it was since the report of the House of Commons; I am not clear when that report was made exactly to the date, nor will I undertake to swear. 
EYRE 9649 Therefore I stopt you, that you might recollect yourself. 
GIBBS 9650 State as near as you can the time 
FRASER 9651 I think it was some time about the beginning of June, or in May, I am not sure ; but I was in the habit of calling upon him as a neighbour when I have gone past. 
GIBBS 9652 Do you remember the time he was taken up
FRASER 9653 Ido mot remember the date of it; I remember to have called at Mr. Hardy's, and then I was informed by his wife that he was taken up; she was in a great deal of trouble, and very ill ; she was frightened upon the occasion, 
GIBBS 9654 She is dead since
FRASER 9655 Yes; and she told me but a few days 
GIBBS 9656 You must not say what she told you, you are not sure what the time was when you had this conversation
FRASER 9657 I belicve in the Month of May, to the best of my recollection. 
GIBBS 9658 Are you a member of cither of these socicties
FRASER 9659 I never was in my life a member of any political society whatever. 
GIBBS 9660 During the time that you have known him, what has been his character, I mean as a peaceable man, or the contrary 
FRASER 9661 I conceived from my first acquaintance with him, that he was a man of few words, and of a very humble, peaceable disposition, and I have never had any occasion to alter that opinion. I believe him to be a man of an honest disposition, and added to that, if I can judge from a man’s conversation, I belicve he is one that fears God and honours the King. 
GIBBS 9662 You have collected this from your conversation with him 
FRASER 9663 I have from knowing him, and the general tenor of his conduct. 
GIBBS 9664 Have you seen him often 
FRASER 9665 I have. 
GIBBS 9666 You told me you had taken pains to draw from him what his opinions were 
FRASER 9667 I have when J first became acquainted with him, and after that, I helievemay say with some degree of confidence, that I was in his confidence as a friend; I believe he looked upon me as a friend. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9668 You did not belong to any of these societies
OLIVER 9669 I did not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9670 Did you ever see a paper published as the proccedings at Chalk-Farm, with Mr. Hardy’s name to it
OLIVER 9671 I never did. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9672 Did you ever see a paper published as the proceedings on the Oth of January, 1794, with Mr. llardy’s name to it
OLIVER 9673 Icannot charge my memory that I ever saw it, I do not recollect the contents of it; I trouble my head very little about politics. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9674 Look at that paper? [showing it to the witness. ]—I do not recollect that I ever saw the fellow to this paper, or this paper before. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9675 Did you know that Mr. Hardy was a member ofa society that had published resolutions in support of Mr. Thomas Paine’s Rights of Man
OLIVER 9676 No; I did not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9677 Then I need not ask you, I take for granted, whether publishing those resolutions in favour of Paine’s Rights of Man, shows the sort of man that you would suppose honours the king? what is your answer to that
OLIVER 9678 I do not know, nor never did know, that Mr. Hardy did favour those resolutions, or that he published any thing of the kind. As I was going to observe, I have but very little time to meddle with those matters; when I can call upon any person that is afflicted, or any poor person, or any one to do them any good, I am always ready to do it; but I have four sermons to preach in a week, and as I make them myself, I have very little spare time. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9679 Did you cver see the bouk, called Paine’s Rights of Man
OLIVER 9680 I have seen it, but never read it through. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9681 Do you know that Mr. Paine was a member of the Constitutional Society 
OLIVER 9682 I do not know any such thing. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9683 Do you happen to know Mr. Bogue, a dissenting minister 
OLIVER 9684 TI have heard of sucha name, butIdo not know the gentleman, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9685 Do you happen to know whether he had any correspondence with Mr. Hardy 
OLIVER 9686 Once upon a time, I think, Mr. Hardy mentioned his name, but I do not know that he said he had a correspondence with him, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9687 Did he inform you whether Mr. Bogue had given him any advice about the papers? Never such a thing was ever mentioned to me by Mr. Hardy. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9688 What did he say to you about Mr. Dogue, the dissenting minister at Portsmouth
OLIVER 9689 I think Mr. Hardy asked me if I knew such a gentleman, and that he was a worthy good man, or to that purpose. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9690 Did he explain to you at all how he came to know any thing of Mr. Bogue of Portsmouth 
OLIVER 9691 By no means in the world. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9692 So that you visited Mr. Hardy, he informed you he knew Mr. Bogue, a dissenting minister at Portsmouth, and you had not the curiosity to inquire what Mr. Hardy in London, had to do with Mr. Bogue, a dissenting minister at Portsmouth
OLIVER 9693 No. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9694 Upon your oath, did Mr. Hardy ever tell you that he had or not been down at Portsmouth to visit any convicts on board a ship at Portsmouth
OLIVER 9695 No. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9696 Nor that he had seen Mr. Bogue upon that occasion 
OLIVER 9697 No, nor any other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9698 You know nothing of Mr. Hardy’s sentiments about Paine’s works
OLIVER 9699 The chief I know of him has been his conversation touching the best things; sometimes he has spoken of politics and parliamentary reform, and that he was a well-wisher to it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9700 am said you had read Paine’s work 
OLIVER 9701 Part of it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9702 Have you ever read any thing about honouring the king in it 
OLIVER 9703 No. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9704 I think you said you were much in Mr. Hardy’s confidence 
OLIVER 9705 I do not know how much, but as a minister may call upon him; it is reasonable to expect they will put confidence in men of our description, when men of character and probity. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9706 Then he never told you any thing about the roceedings of the London Corresponding Society, either at Chalk-Farm or any of those other places
OLIVER 9707 He did not; I only came to sak as to what I know about Mr. Hardy's character. 
GIBBS 9708  Thelieve you are secretary to the Society of the Friends of the People
OLIVER 9709 I have acted as secretary to the committee of that society. 
GIBBS 9710 Meeting in Frith-street
OLIVER 9711 Yes. 
GIBBS 9712 Have you ever happened to see Mr. Hardy the’ prisoner 
OLIVER 9713 Very frequently. 
GIBBS 9714 Upon what occasions have you seen him
OLIVER 9715 I have seen him many years ago, but never had occasion to speak to him til] within something less than two years ; about December, 1792. 
GIBBS 9716 Upon what occasion did you see him then
OLIVER 9717 The London Corresponding Society sent a letter to the Society of the Friends of the People; when the letter was answered I carried the answer myself to Mr. Hardy’s house in Piccadilly, and delivered it to him, and from that time in passing Piccadilly frequently, I have called in at his shop, merely to converse with him, and to know what news there was. 
GIBBS 9718 Had Pea any conversationswith him relative to the London Corresponding Society 
OLIVER 9719 Very frequently. 
GIBBS 9720 hat did he tell you the object of that society was
OLIVER 9721 He always told me the sole object of the society was, a reform in the representation in the House of Commons. 
GIBBS 9722 Did he ever converse with you upon the way in which he wished that reform to be brought about? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9723 Thatis not a proper question. 
GIBBS 9724 I ask this in order to sift the mind of the prisoner; the crime imputed to the prisoner is an act of the mind; this case is an anomalous one—the compassingin his own mind the king’s death ; I am asking as to the conversations he has had upon the subject, in order to find what were his intentions, what the state of his mind was upon that subject. 
EYRE 9725 What the tenor of his conversation was, is, I suppose, your object. 
EYRE 9726 Mr. Attorney Generali cannot say 1 think it worth disputing. 
GIBBS 9727 What were the means by which you understood from him that the London Corresponding Society wished to bri about this end
OLIVER 9728 I always understood from him, that he thought the best means were to inform the people of the bad state of the representation, and so to gain a number of members to the society, that they might get a great number of signatures to a petition to ie con by which means a reform might e obtained. 
GIBBS 9729 Did you see him at any time after this 
OLIVER 9730 S ince that time, till the time that he was taken up, I was in the habit of calling on him perhaps once, twice, or more times in a week ; it was very uncertain ; prineipally from curiosity I used to call at his house, and have conversation with him generally about his society, and the other societies that his society were in correspondence with, about what they were doing respecting a reform in parliament ; that always made the basis of our conversation. 
GIBBS 9731 Did it appear to you, that he re, dence in you 
OLIVER 9732 I have not a doubt he did; we talked very freely about a reform and the best means of producing it, and in one point he and I never could agree; he said the duke of Richmond's plan would be the plan at last—I said I did not think it was the best plan; that was the only point we disagreed upon. 
GIBBS 9733 Had you any conversation with him concerning this convention ‘that was talked about 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9734 This convention that was talked ‘about—not having said one word about a convention. 
GIBBS 9735 There may be a little irregularity in putting the question, I only want to bring him to the time. 
GIBBS 9736 Lord Chief' Justice Eyre
OLIVER 9737 You onght to inquire to be sure, first of all, whether he knows any thing of a osed convention, and whether he had any opportunity of knowing what the prisoner's sentiments were respecting that convention. 
GIBBS 9738 Had you ever any conversation with him ?Mr. Stuart
OLIVER 9739 There is one thing in pert cular I think it my duty to mention with regard to whether he was likely to confide in me, or tell me his mind. 
EYRE 9740 You have said you thought he did put confidence in you
OLIVER 9741  There was one particular occasion. 
EYRE 9742 I do not want to know the private history between you and him ; if you say you think he put confidence in you, it is very well. 
GIBBS 9743 Had you ever any conversation with him abont any convention 
OLIVER 9744 I do not exactly remember that I had; but I have no doubt that I had. 
GIBBS 9745 During the time you have known him, what character has he borne 
OLIVER 9746 From others and from my own observation, I have always thought him a very simple man in his manners; of a very inoffensive, peaceable conduct, and the last man I should have thought that would have been guilty of any violent conduct. 
GIBBS 9747 Have you had any opportunity of collecting from him whether it was his object to bring this about by peaceable means, or otherwise 
OLIVER 9748 I have always heard him say he wished it to be brought about by peaceable means; I never heard bim mention violent means in my life—quite the reverse. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9749 You are secretary to a society calling themselves the Friends of the People 
STUART 9750 Secretary to the committee of the society ; I never was appointed secretary to the society. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9751 You know there is a society in London called the Society for Constitutional Information 
STUART 9752 Yes; I know there is. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9753 It may possibly have occurred to you, as secretary to the Society of the Friends of the People, to know that the latter society rejected all correspondence with the former
STUART 9754 Yes; I know that. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9755 Did you happen to know that the prisoner at the bar was an associated member of that society 
STUART 9756 I never heard that he was; I never knew of my own knowledge who were members of either the London Corresponding Society, or the Society tor Constitutional Information, S 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9757 Then you being secretary to the committee of the Society of the Friends of the People, and the Society of the Friends of the People having rejected all correspondence with the Society for Constitutional Information, you did not know that the prisoner was an associated member of the Society for Constitupane Information 
STUART 9758 I never knew it in my fe. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9759 Do you remember a letter being written by your society to the Society for Constituae Information, from lord John Russel 
STUART 9760 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9761 Do you remember any correspondence between your society, the Friends of the People, and a society at Sheffield
STUART 9762 Yes, I do, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9763 Do you recollect whether that was in the month of May, 1792, or not
STUART 9764 Yes; I think the first letter received from Sheflield was in the month of May, 1792, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9765 Do you happen to know, that the society at Sheffield, in the month of May, 1792, wrote a letter to the Constitutional Society, whose correspondence your society bad rejected, saying, they would have nothing more to do with the Friends of the People, because they were not pursuing the principles of the rights of man
STUART 9766 I know nothing of that at all. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9767 ‘Do you recollect what were the reasons why the Society of the Friends of the Feople would have nothing more to do with the Society for Constitutional Information
STUART 9768 I believe the reasons are assigned in the letter that was sent in answer. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9769 With reference to their having recommended Mr. Paine’s great plans of reform 
STUART 9770 Yes; I believe that is in the answer. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9771 Do you happen to know, that the London Corresponding Society have been going upon the same plans of reform 
STUART 9772 I cannot exactly say that I did. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9773 Did you ever see the London Corresponding Society’s address of the 6th of August, 1792 
STUART 9774 I cannot say I ever saw it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9775 Did you ever see an address of the London Corresponding Society of the 20th of January, 1794
STUART 9776 I have. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9777 Have you seen the London aneeponing Suciety’s resolutions at Chalk-farm
STUART 9778 Yes, I have. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9779 They wrote to your society about a convention, I believe —They did. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9780 You rejected that
STUART 9781  The society declined it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9782 I believe your society had some correspondence with the London Corresponding Society ; during all these proceedings, do you recollect any application they made to you to know the principles of your society 
STUART 9783 I think there was a letter, not exactly to know the principles of the society, but to know the plan they meant to adopt. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9784 Did your society inform them what length they meant to go at that time
STUART 9785 I believe they declined to inform them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9786 Do I understand you right, that you never heard of the prisoner’s being an associated member of the Constitutional Society whose correspondence your society had rejected; that you knew nothing of the address of the London Corresponding Society of the 6th of August, 1792; that you knew nothing except what you have learned now of the proceedings of the 20th of January, 1794, and of the proceedings at Chalk-farm
STUART 9787 Nothing more.

STUART 9791 I believe not all of them ; some have withdrawn, and some new members have been added to this society, since that list was made.

UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10029 And from what I have heard of him. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10030 Were you a member of any of those societies 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10031 Never. 
ERSKINE 10032 My lord, I would now state a fact, which probably the attorney general will admit
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10033 Your lordship, and the jury, will tecollect, that in the course of the evidence, a letter was proved to have been written by one Davison, at Sheffield, to the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Hardy, enclosing a letter (which letter was also read to the jury), which was requested to have been forwarded by the prisoner to Norwich, for purposes similar to that for which Davison is supposed to have sent it; I wish to prove, by a gentleman now in my eye, if the fact is not admitted, that that letter was found in Mr. Hardy’s possession unopened. 
EYRE 10034 The material observation arising upon it is that it was unsent, because he had no business to open it. 
ERSKINE 10035 It is a strong circumstance that it remained unopened and unsent, for such a length of time. 
EYRE 10036 Its being unsent’ is, I think, a strong circumstance indeed, but its being unopened J do not think amounts to much. 
ERSKINE 10037  Did you find the letter in the possession of the prisoner, when he was taken into custody, which has been given in evidence, in an enclosure 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10038 No; I did not find any of the letters, they were all taken away by the peuple who came. 
ERSKINE 10039 Did you see them 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10040 I saw them. 
ERSKINE 10041 Was the enclosure of the letter, that was directed to Norwich, open or not
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10042 I cannot exactly speak as to that fact ; but I remember the messenger, while he was marking the paper, said, “ here is a letter unopened, I 
ERSKINE 10043 se that to be the letter. ho was that person
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10044 I think it was Gurnell. 
ERSKINE 10045 You recollect the messengers taking notice that there was a letter then unopened 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10046 Yes; which I understood to be a letter, enclosed in another letter. I said, “ open that letter and mark it the same as the rest. 
ERSKINE 10047  What is your trade 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10048 An engraver. 
ERSKINE 10049 Where is your place of residence 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10050 At Sheffield. 
ERSKINE 10051 How long have you been an inhabitant of Sheffield 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10052 About twelve years. 
ERSKINE 10053 Have you carried on trade during that time
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10054 I have. 
ERSKINE 10055 Were you a member of the Sheffield Society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10056 I was. 
ERSKINE 10057 When did you become so 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10058 Within about three months from the time of its commencement. 
ERSKINE 10059 Up to what time did you continue a member 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10060 Till the time that Mr. Camage, and other persons, were taken up; that is, I have not attended at the society since. 
ERSKINE 10061 What was your object in being a member of that society 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10062 For the purpose of obtaining a reform in the Commons House of Parliament, by legal and constitutional means. 
ERSKINE 10063 That was your own object 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10064 It was. 
ERSKINE 10065 Task you, upon your solemn oath, and the truth is better than all other things, from all that you observed, and heard, and saw, in the course of your attendance upon that society, had you any reason to believe, or have you now, before God, any reason to believe, that their objects were different from your own
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10066 B y no means.’ 
ERSKINE 10067 Did you ever see any thing pass, or did you hear any thing that led you to believe, or that Jeads you now to believe, that there was an intention to attack the government by armed force and violence
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10068 Not the most distant idea of it. 
ERSKINE 10069 Were you a member of the Sheffield Society at the time it sent its delegates to Scotland
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10070 Yes, 1 was. 
ERSKINE 10071 From what passed in the society, upon that occasion, what was your object in sending your delegate ; what was he to do
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10072 For the purpose of co-operating with the other delegates from the different societies, in order to produce the object I have already mentioned. 
ERSKINE 10073 By what means did you intend, or contemplate, that this end was to be accomplished 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10074 By a petition to parliament. 
ERSKINE 10075 What was the reason, after the petition brought forward by Mr. Grey had been rejected, for having delegates? what did you expect would be the consequence of a petition from dclegates
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10076 I do not perfectly understand you. 
ERSKINE 10077 What good effect did you expect to arise from sending delegates in order to have a petition from large bodies of people 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10078 The effect of a general co-operation of the great body of the people, the effect of the general sentiment, 
ERSKINE 10079 What effect did you expect that sentiment to produce? did you expect it to make an impression upon the parliament so as to induce them to grant the redress applied for 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10080 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10081 You expected that the general sentiment of the people, as far as you could collect it, would make an impression upon the parliament, and produce that effect 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10082 I did. 
ERSKINE 10083 Task you solemnly, upon your oath, whether it was in your comtemplation, or from what you heard and saw in the course of the debates and proceedings, as far as you are acquainted with them, whether it was the intention of those delegates to contrive means by which parliament should be compelled to grant it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10084 Ry no means. 
ERSKINE 10085 Would you have remained a member of the society it veu had reason to believe or suspect that that was the object 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10086 I certainly would not. 
ERSKINE 10087 Was any thing said, or did you collect from the gencral objects of your society, that it was their intention to affect the king's majesty, either in his person, or his state and dignity
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10088 Certainly not. 
ERSKINE 10089 Was there any intention that you could collect (I am not asking your ideas or imagination) from what passed in your hearing in the course of the proceedings of the societs, to touch the Lords House of Parliament
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10090 Certainly not. 
ERSKINE 10091 Were yau at the Castle-hill when Mr. Yorke made a speech there 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10092 I attended the latter end of the meeting; but I heard very litueo It. 
ERSKINE 10093 I take for granted that every now and thes a hot spirit might show itself? 
EYRE 10094 Do not take am thing for granted when you are examipings witness. 
ERSKINE 10095 I will not ask any moe questions; I am quite satisfied with what be has said.

ATTORNEYGENERAL 10124 Do you recollect a letter from the Tendoa Society being read in the committee, desins2 that you might propose that you should be come associated members of the sucietY it do not particularly recollect. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10125 Particularly recollect! do you recollect 32 thing about it
MARTIN 10126 I cannot take upon me t say. Witt you say you do not recollect ?—I 6 not recollect. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10127 You were not acquainted, I believe, with the particulars of the conduct of the convention in Scotland, were you
MARTIN 10128 No farther than what appeared in the public newspapers. What newspapers are you speaking of — 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10129 The Edinburgh papers. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10130 What, the paper called the Gazetteer
MARTIN 10131 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10132 Then am I to understand you, that you know of the proceedings of the convention, as they appeared in that Gazetteer
MARTIN 10133 I have heard them read. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10134 Then you approved of the proceedings as they appeared in that Gazettecr, did you
MARTIN 10135 Not altogether. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10136 What part of them did you disapprove of 
MARTIN 10137 P articularly that part relating to a secret committee. it? you a secret committee at Sheffield ?—No. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10138 You had not got so far as that
MARTIN 10139 No, nothing of the kind was ever entertained. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10140 You say you were at the Castle-hill
MARTIN 10141 I was at partofthe meeting; at only the latter part of the meeting. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10142 you remember that when somebody Proposed to petition the House of Commons, It was negatived, and it was determined to petition the House of Commons no more 
MARTIN 10143 I was at the outside of the people, and thercfore could not hear the proceedings. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10144 You would probably have disapproved of that resolution, if you had heard it 
MARTIN 10145 Perhaps I might. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10146 Sv I should have supposed—you know Mr. Yorke 
MARTIN 10147 I do. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10148 Was he a Sheffield man 
MARTIN 10149 I believe not. a brought him to Shefficld?—I cannot Had you much acquaintance with him?—No anu previous to his first coming to'Sheftield. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10150 You knew a great deal of him, I believe, after he did come
MARTIN 10151 I frequently have heard him speak in private, and in public. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10152 You were very intimate with him, were not you
MARTIN 10153 I cannot say I was very intimate. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10154 Were you very often with him in private 
MARTIN 10155  I was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10156 Having been very often with him in private, you and he had both the same opinion about obtaining a reform by peaceable means
MARTIN 10157 I cannot say we had altogether. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10158 What was the difference between you 
MARTIN 10159 I cannot recollect exactly ; with respect to a reform in parliament, we differed in many other circumstances respecting political matters, but with respect to the specific difference I cannot at nt recollect. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10160 Do you know who the editors of the Patriot were 
MARTIN 10161 I do not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10162 Upon your oath do not you
MARTIN 10163 I do not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10164 Did you never bear who were the editors of that paper 
MARTIN 10165 No, I never did, only what public report has said; I never heard who were but merely by public rumour. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10166 Did you ever hear by public rumour, or otherwise, who were the editors of the Patriot 
MARTIN 10167 I have heard it said that certain pers sons were editors of the Patriot. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10168 Who did you hear it said were editors of the Patriot
MARTIN 10169 Mr. Brown was mentioned as one person. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10170 Do you know Mr. Brown’s hand-writing when you see it 
MARTIN 10171 I believe I do. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10172 Mr. Brown was your delegate to the convention, was not he 
MARTIN 10173 He was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10174 He was a peaceable well-disposed man 
MARTIN 10175 W e believed so. Do youremember your society having any communication with a society at Steckport ?—I etters have occasiunally passed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10176 Have you seen their letters in your society 
MARTIN 10177 I have seen some letters, but do not particularly recollect any of them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10178 They were also peaceably disposed, and associated for the same end as yourself, no doubt 
MARTIN 10179 We believed so. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10180 Tell me whether that showing the witness a letter] is Mr. Campbell Brown’s hand-writing or not, according to your belief
MARTIN 10181 I believe it is. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10182 You know upon the Castle-hill, that there was a motion made to petition the House of Commons 
MARTIN 10183 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10184 Upon your oath were you in the secret that that motion was made, by contrivance, to be negatived 
MARTIN 10185 I was not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10186 0 you know it now
MARTIN 10187 I know it by seeing it mentioned in the public papers. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10188 You know it no otherwise 
MARTIN 10189 I have heard it spoken of generally among people that they supposed so. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10190 At the time you attended the meeting, you did not know that that was a contrivance 
MARTIN 10191 I did not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10192 And many hundred others of you, I suppose, did not 
MARTIN 10193 I belicve so. 
ERSKINE 10194  When you say the motion was negatived for petitioning parliament, do you mean to say it was negatived to petition parliament ultimately by the delegates, when they got the sense of a larger body of the people 
MARTIN 10195 I understood the not petitioning parliament, applicd to the present parliament, the present House of Commons. 
ERSKINE 10196 Whatever Mr. Brown Campbell, or Mr. Campbell Brown might write, or whatever he might think, or whatever he might do, did your socicty give him any authority to act for you at. Edinburgh, except in a legal and constitutional manner 
MARTIN 10197 By no means. 
ERSKINE 10198 Ido not care whether he acted legally or not, but did your society Li? him authority, confining ‘him within the limits of legal and constitutional behaviour 
MARTIN 10199 They certainly did. 
ERSKINE 10200 Would you have consented to the sending of himto Edinburgh, if youhad oclieved that he would have transgressed the rules of law
MARTIN 10201 I would not. 
ERSKINE 10202 You might be mistaken undoubtedly ; but I wish to know whether you acted with the intention that you have stated to us ?e—I certainly did. 
EYRE 10203 Were the proceedings at the Castle-hill published 
MARTIN 10204 They were. 
EYRE 10205  Was Mr. Yorke’s speech published likewise
MARTIN 10206 Yes; the proceedings, including the principal part of Mr. Yorke’s speech. 
EYRE 10207 Do you mean that speech 
MARTIN 10208 The speech which was afterwards published. 
EYRE 10209 And you have read that speech 
MARTIN 10210 Yes, I have seen it. 
ERSKINE 10211  What are you 
MARTIN 10212 A plater. 
ERSKINE 10213 An inhabitant of Sheffield 
MARTIN 10214 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10215 A housekeeper there
MARTIN 10216 I am not a houseKeeper; I live with my father. 
ERSKINE 10217 What is your father 
MARTIN 10218 A grocer. 
ERSKINE 10219 Were you a member of the society 
MARTIN 10220 I was. 
ERSKINE 10221 From what time to what time 
MARTIN 10222 I think from the year 1791, to the present time. 
ERSKINE 10223 Did you attend frequently the meetings of the society 
MARTIN 10224 Yes, I did. 
ERSKINE 10225 Did you attend them what might be called regularly 
MARTIN 10226 I did in the general; I was not at every meeting. 
ERSKINE 10227 Butin the general you were a good attendant
MARTIN 10228 Yes. What was your object ?—My object in joining the society was this; if by lawful and constitutional means, in co-operation with the rest of my brethren, we might be able to gain a reform in parliament. 
ERSKINE 10229 How did you expect that that co-operation with the rest of your brethren would produce that consequence 
MARTIN 10230 We expected that our pe‘titions would be heard. 
ERSKINE 10231 Did you expect more effect from petitions which might afterwards be presented, under a delegation from large bodies, than might be procured by the petitions of a small number? Yes, 
ERSKINE 10232 Did you consider that such petitions from delegates of large bodies of people, were more likely to impress parliament with the policy and justice of the measure 
MARTIN 10233 I did. 
ERSKINE 10234 Was it your intention, as far as you must be acquainted with your own objects, if you were disappointed in the effect which you expected, to use force or violence: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10235 Please to ask him what his intention was. 
ERSKINE 10236 Be so good as to hear the question out, Ido not like to be interrupted in the middle ofa question. 
EYRE 10237 You have not asked the witness one question yet which hes not been irregular. 
EYRE 10238 Mr. Erskine. How am I toask a witness a question, touching a particular point, without leading him, in some measure? I do not mean to put the answer in his mouth;Iwill pursue the question in the very going to do, and will argue it with the gentleincn. 
EYRE 10239 way I was 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10240 It is not worth arguing. 
ERSKINE 10241 Then it is not worth intertupting mein this way. If the ge the success of which you contemp k not have been attended with effect, wasit your object to use force
MARTIN 10242 No, never. 
ERSKINE 10243 ted, should 
ERSKINE 10244 Would you have remained in the society, if you had had any reason to believe that thit was the object of others 
MARTIN 10245 I would not. 
ERSKINE 10246 From what passed in the society, when yu were present at their meetings, what did rolleck to be their object oT never ine. stood that the object of the society, as a body, or as individuals, was any thing more thana seform in parliament; dnd they did not, a far as I knew of them, desire, in the least, to gain this object by any other means than by petitioning parliament. 
ERSKINE 10247 Were you present, upon the Castle hill, when a petition to parliament was rej and a petition to the king put in the room of it
MARTIN 10248 I was. 
ERSKINE 10249 When that petition to the House of Com mons, was negatived for the present, wasit determined, at no future time, to petition par liament, when ‘you had got the sense of 8 larger body of people? 
ERSKINE 10250 ton Chief Justice Eyre.—Do you koow what the terms of the resolution were 
MARTIN 10251 I 0 not recollect at present. 
ERSKINE 10252 Ilis lordship, I suppose, does not ask as to the words, but if you the substance of it
MARTIN 10253 I do not know that the solution was, stating that parliament never be petitioned again. 
ERSKINE 10254 Did it refer to that time, or to all times
MARTIN 10255 I rather think it’ pasticulasly referred to thst time only. 
ERSKINE 10256 Were you in the society at the time whet it was proposed to send a delegate to land 
MARTIN 10257 Yes, I was. 
ERSKINE 10258 Did the proposition to have a convent in Scotland, and to have delegates sent to ih come to your society from Scotland, of you send to it
MARTIN 10259 I do not recollect. 
ERSKINE 10260 When you sent your delegate, what 73 the object of the society, as far as you edit from what you heard upon the oc sion; I am not asking your ideas and novow in sending Mr. Brown to Edinburgh i—The object of the society, as far as I knew of, a sending Matthew Campbell Brown to Bd burgh, was, in order that proper m q might be considered of, for the purpo gaining a reform. in parliament. we 
ERSKINE 10261 Was Matthew, Campbell Brown, 88 gate from your society, to express the which your society had 
MARTIN 10262 He was. 
ERSKINE 10263 Was it the object of your society that your, delegate should express your idea 
MARTIN 10264 It was ; I dare say our delegate would have been recalled from the convention, if any other object had been proposed 
ERSKINE 10265 Was he directed to pursue the object which the society expressed 
MARTIN 10266 He was. 
ERSKINE 10267 When the delegates, from the different societies had got together, what were they to do 
MARTIN 10268 They were to point out the proper way of addressing parliament unknown to us. 
EYRE 10269 Did you say unknown to us
MARTIN 10270 Of addressing parliament in a constitutional way, that might not altogether be thought upon by us; we thought them persons more capable of judging of the most effectual way of addressing parliament than ourselves. 
ERSKINE 10271 What effect did you consider might be produced by having delegates assembled, peaceably, from very large bodies of people—what effect did you contemplate that would have with parliament 
MARTIN 10272 We supposed that petitions coming from so respectable a body as we thought them, would have considerable weight with parliament. 
ERSKINE 10273 Did you think that petitions, coming from delegates, from a great body of people, would have more effect than a petition from a small body 
MARTIN 10274 We did. 
ERSKINE 10275 Did you contemplate that, by the pursuit of the same peaceable means, parliament might ultimately yield, from a sense of justice, to your wishes
MARTIN 10276 That was our ultimate expectation. 
ERSKINE 10277 From any thing that passed in your society, was there any thing in contemplation against the king
MARTIN 10278 Not against the king. 
ERSKINE 10279 Against his title, or office 
MARTIN 10280  Nothing against his title, or office, or life. 
ERSKINE 10281 Was any thing said, when the delegate was sent to Scotland, concerning the House of Lords
MARTIN 10282 I do not particularly recollect whether there was or no. 
ERSKINE 10283 Did the object of your society extend farther than the representation of the people in the House of Commons 
MARTIN 10284 I believe not. 
ERSKINE 10285 When did you first hear, what we have heard a good deal of in this court, of any arms, or pikes ? —I do not particularly recollect the time ; it was a few months back. 
ERSKINE 10286 Just a little before Mr. Camage was taken up, was not it
MARTIN 10287 Not long before. 
ERSKINE 10288 Do you recollect whether the society, or any part of it, had been insulted, or threatened
MARTIN 10289 Yes, I recollect very well, the society had very great apprehensions of danger from the opposite party, because the opposite party given them cause to fear, by their repeated threats to the society, and by the ill usage that some of the membersof the society had met with from them. 
ERSKINE 10290 Do you mean, by the opposite party, the Magistrates
MARTIN 10291 No, by no means the magistrates, but individuals, who took upon themselves an authority which we thought they had no right to. ; 
ERSKINE 10292 Do you recollect whether that was com-, plained of in the society, and whether any danger was thought of 
MARTIN 10293 It was complained of in the society, as a thing that was thought by the society not right. 
ERSKINE 10294 Task you, upon your most solemn oath, whether there was ever any thing passed in the society, for arming it as a body, for an at-" tack upon the government of the country 
MARTIN 10295 I am sensible in whose presence I now stand, and I desire to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; and, in the presence of God, I can ay affirm, upon my oath, that that never was designed, never agitated, and, I believe, never thought of in the society, to arm as a body, to attack government. 
ERSKINE 10296 If any such idea had ever occurred to any wicked man, or wicked men, in your society, have reason to believe that you should have known it
MARTIN 10297 I should. 
ERSKINE 10298 I do not ask you what any wicked man, in. his own private mind, might have intended, but if it had been the object of your society, or any number of them, do you believe yu should have known it
MARTIN 10299 I believe I should. 
BOWER 10300 Be so good as to remember, when you an-swer my questions, that you have spoken about the solemnity of your oath—You have been a member of the Sheffield Society, you say, from the year 1791
OAKES 10301 I have. 
BOWER 10302 Have you been intimately acquainted with the proceedings of that society 
OAKES 10303 Yes. 
BOWER 10304 You stated that, I think —Yes. Had you a committee of members of your. society, who managed for the society 
OAKES 10305 Yes. 
BOWER 10306 Were you a member of that committee 
OAKES 10307 Yes. 
BOWER 10308 Were you there at the time when twelve’ members were sent, or intended to be sent, from the Constitutional Society at Sheffield, to the Constitutional Society in London
OAKES 10309 I never was present when any such thing was ever proposed, : 
BOWER 10310 Do you not know, in fact, you that were intimate with all the proceedings of the society, that twelve members were deputed from Sheffield, to be elected members of the Constitutional Society, in London? 
OAKES 10311 To be elected members? 
BOWER 10312 Yes
OAKES 10313 I do not know that I was present. 
BOWER 10314 If you mean to turn any thing upon the word elected,—to be sent, to have a communication with them ? 
BOWER 10315 Oukes
OAKES 10316 To be deputed, to be sent from Shef field to them ? 
BOWER 10317 Yes
OAKES 10318 No, I never was at any meeting where there was such a proposition made. 
BOWER 10319 Were they to be associated, any of your members with the society in London 
OAKES 10320 I do not know that they were, in any wise, to he’ associated to them, any farther than by correspondence, 
BOWER 10321 Were they then to be associated by correspondence 
OAKES 10322 In order to co-operate with each other, for the purposes I have mentioned. 
BOWER 10323 Were you there then, when it was agreed, or settled, that twelve members of your s0ciety should be associated with the Landon society, for the purpose of correspondence 
OAKES 10324 I do not recollect whether I was or nat. 
BOWER 10325 Did you never hear in the committee, that such a step had been agreed upon 
OAKES 10326 I cannot particularly answer to that. 
BOWER 10327 I beg you would recollect yourself, whether you do not recollect that such a circumstance appencd; do you meun to say it did not happen 
OAKES 10328 I do, by no means, wish to insinuate that it did not happen; but ] do not recollect whether there was any such proposition made. 
BOWER 10329 Do you not believe the fact, that such persons were associated 
OAKES 10330 I do not believe that there was. 
BOWER 10331 Do you know, whether. any proposal that was mnade about associating members of your society, came from London, or was at first Propet from Sheffield 
OAKES 10332 Indeed I do not now. 
BOWER 10333 Did you constantly attend the committecs 
OAKES 10334 I did not. 
BOWER 10335 And you never heard, either before or after such a measure, that it had actually taken place 
OAKES 10336 I did not. 
EYRE 10337 Did your committee take your proceedings down in writing? 
EYRE 10338 Sometimes. 
EYRE 10339 Did they keep a regular account
OAKES 10340 Not a regular account. 
BOWER 10341 What are become of those proceedings that were put into writing at those committees 
OAKES 10342 Indeed, I am perfectly a stranger to them; for at the time the persons were apprehended and taken from sheffield to Londen, I did not, at that moment, or at that time, attend the committee; so that I cannot answer for any thing that the committee did in my absence. 
BOWER 10343 Tn whose custody were the proceedings that were put into writing usually kept 
OAKES 10344 By William Broomhead. 
BOWER 10345 You said, you expected your petitions would be heard; were you present, when that resolution passed which we have been talking of, when it was resolved not to petition parliamont any more 
OAKES 10346 I was. 
BOWER 10347 Were you present when any letter was written from the Conmuvaonah Society at Shellield, to the Society for Constitutional Information at London, respecting a radical reforin of the country, the 14th of March 1792; that is long subsequent to the time of your Lecoming a member 
OAKES 10348 Unless I was to kaow the contents of the letter I cannot speak. 
BOWER 10349 I will show it you; do you know a man of the name of Sarouel Ashton 
OAKES 10350 Yes. 
BOWER 10351 Was he an active member of your society 
OAKES 10352 He was at the first period of it. 
BOWER 10353 Up to what period 
OAKES 10354 I do not know. 
BOWER 10355 Where is he now 
OAKES 10356 Indeed I do Bet kaew. 
BOWER 10357 ton’s hand-writing; I am going to call a vie 
BOWER 10358 Ishe at Sheffield
OAKES 10359 I apprehend not;believe he is somewhere in the country. 
BOWER 10360 Did he correspond with the London Cor. responding Society, in the name of the Shefield Society 
OAKES 10361 Yes. 
BOWER 10362 Is that letter Ashton’s hand-writing
OAKES 10363 I cannot answer to it. 
BOWER 10364 You must have seen him write frequeally in the society
OAKES 10365 When he was an active member of the society, I was not an active member. 
BOWER 10366 Have you never seen Ashton write, upca the solemn oath to which you have appealed
OAKES 10367 I never saw him write any letter to ay correspondent. 
BOWER 10368 Have you seen him write upon any sub ject 
OAKES 10369 I do not recollect whether I haveo not; I have seen him write, but not to ea mine his writing. 
ERSKINE 10370 You may take it to be Ask ness to prove Ashton’s hand-writing. 
ERSKINE 10371 Mr. Bower,—What is Samuel Ashton}—I believe he was orginally a painter. 
ERSKINE 10372 What is he now
OAKES 10373 I suppose now he bis obtained a patent, for the purpose of tanning leather. 
ERSKINE 10374 You do not know where he is now
OAKES 10375 Id not. 
ERSKINE 10376 You may look at the contents of that letter, and tell me, whether you know of that letter being sent to London 
ERSKINE 10377 Now you have read that letter; upon your oath, do you know of that letter being sent to London 
OAKES 10378 I cannot answer to that. 
ERSKINE 10379 Do you believe you did; I will try yu first in that way, because I advise you, that we know more of this than you are aware of, and therefore be cautious ; upon your oath, it the first place, do you believe, or not, thet was sent
OAKES 10380 At the time that this letter was wrote, I was not an active member, pormitted into their meetings. 
ERSKINE 10381 Did you at any time after you becamea member, know that that letter had beea written
OAKES 10382 The letters were not altogether known to the society at large: therefore 1am not able to answer. 
ERSKINE 10383 There is one thing in which you arc wa: curate; but I do not want to surprise you; 
ERSKINE 10384 ou stated in your examination, that you ha been a member of this society in 1794; this letter is dated the 14th of March 1799, and of course must be written at the time you were a member 
OAKES 10385 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10386 Then though you had been a member from 1791 to March 1792, you did not know of that letter being written
OAKES 10387 We as a body, 3 pointed representatives for us; and there! we entrusted to them to transact our busines, as they kuew our views. 
ERSKINE 10388 Was any report ever made to the society, what the committees had been doing
OAKES 10389 Yes, at times there were. 
ERSKINE 10390 About what periods; once a fortnight, a month, three months, or at about what intervals
OAKES 10391 Sometimes they were often made, and sometimes not. 
ERSKINE 10392 What was the time that was oftenest, was it once a week
OAKES 10393 No. 
ERSKINE 10394 Once a fortnight? 
EYRE 10395 Had you any fixed time
OAKES 10396 We had not. 
BOWER 10397 Upon your oath, do you ever remember a report being made of the proceedings about the period of the 14th of March, 1792 
OAKES 10398 Indeed, 1 am not able to answer to that; I cannot recollect. 
BOWER 10399 You say, in that letter, that it is upon the pede of the Rights of Man; had those woks been received in your society as the principles upon which you were to act, Paine’s Rights of Man 
OAKES 10400 They had been introduced into the society before they were proved to be a libel. 
BOWER 10401 Your pwnciples, however, that you state, are the right to a thorough reformation, a radical returm of the country, upon a system consistent with the rights of man. Were the rights of man described in that book and this Ietter 
OAKES 10402 I do not know whether this letter particularly means the Rights of Man, as particularly wrote by Mr. Paine. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10403 Read up that sentence : “ Jf the Society for Constitutional Information in London, should vouchsafe so far to notice us, as to enter into a connexion and correspondence with us, it cannot fail of promoting honour, and adding strength to our feeble endeavours, and to the common cause, which is the entire motive we have in view. 
ERSKINE 10404 Begin at the beginning, and read the whole letter
OAKES 10405 The gentlemen of the 
ERSKINE 10406 Jhiry will be so guod as to take down the date of this letter; it is the 14th of March, 1792, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10407 That is put the letter we meant; but you may read that. 
BOWER 10408  this is not the paper that Iam examining to; but 1 have no objection in the world to his reading it. 
ERSKINE 10409 I1 have no wish to consume the time of the Court ; 1 only wish the jury to take down that date, the 14th of March, 
ERSKINE 10410 1792, because I havea witness to call in a few minutes. 
BOWER 10411 As you desire to have it read, let the witness read it aloud, “ Sir ; It is now abouts four months since this society farst formed itself into a regular body, then but very few in number; the enclosed will inform you of their increase, and which, is most probable, will soon become very numerous ; and notonly this large and populous town, but the whole neighbourhood, tor many miles round about, have an attentive eye upun us; most of the towns and vallages, indeed, are furming themsclves to good order and regularity, and the need we have of coasulting and communicating with those who are sincere friends, and able advocates for the same cause; for these reasons, we took the liberty of writing ta Mr. 
BOWER 10412 Horne Tvoke, that worthy friend and patriotfor the rights of the people, informing him of our earnest desires of entering into a cen-' nexion with the society of the same denomination with ours in London: His very obliging and affectionate answer favours us wit your address; In consequence, we have taken the liberty, herewith to transmit to you some resolves, which were passed at our last meetings by the whole body; and the committee was charged with the dispatch of printing, and forwarding them to you accordingly, for the purpose of submitting them to the consideration of your society, ta make such use of them as they think most prudent. 
BOWER 10413 “ You will also notice the Belpar address ; they applied to us, about two munths ago, for instructions, as to our mode of conducting, &c. had not then formed themselves into any regular association. Belpar is nearly thirty miles from this place, in Derbyshire, and cight or ten miles from Derby. 
BOWER 10414 f the Society for Constitutional Information, in London, should vouchsafe so far to notice us, as to enter into a connexion and correspondence with us, it cannot fail of promoting honour, and adding strength to our feeble endeavours, and to the common cause, which is the entire motive we have in view. Tam, sir, with the greatest respeet and esteem, your sincere friend,

BOWER 10418 “We have taken the liberty of enclosing a parcel for Mr. Hardy, in answer to a letter from him to this society, requesting some information concerning our methad of conducting the business we are embarked in, &c. also informing us, there are, in London, a number of mechanics, shopkeepers, &c. forming themsclvcs into a society, on the broad basis of the Rights of Nan. You will be so obliging as to let the packet remain with you ; until he call for it, as by this post I have ; wrote him thereof. We have given him our manner of proceeding, from our setting out to this time, and hope it may be of some use ; the improvement we are about to adopt is certainly the best for managing large bodies, as in great and populous towns, viz. dividing ; them into small bodies or meetings of ten Persons cach, and those ten to appoint a delegate: ten of these delegates form another meeting, and so on, delegating from one another, till at last are reduced to a proper number for constituting the committee, or ; grand council.

BOWER 10420 Please to forward the packet to Mr. Hardy, as soon as convenient. 
BOWER 10421 The last letter was: put into your hand by a mistake; I would wish you tocal reform ofthe country, what word was the read this letter [giving the witness another letter-]— It is the same date, the 14th of March, 1792; Sheffield Society for Constitutional Information, to the Society for Constitutional Information, in London. 
BOWER 10422 Who is it directed to on the other side 
OAKES 10423 There is no direction on it. 
ERSKINE 10424 It is necessary the jury should know, as you go on, that this is not new matter; thatit is matter which has been proved before. 
BOWER 10425 Certainly.—Is that the handwriting of Mr. Ashton 
OAKES 10426 I cannot answer to his hand-writing in any respect. 
BOWER 10427 Do you believe it to be his hand-writing
OAKES 10428 I am not acquainted with his hand-writing. 
BOWER 10429 You have seen him write
OAKES 10430 But not to notice his hand-writing. 
ERSKINE 10431 I am going to prove his hand-writing, as I stated before. 
ERSKINE 10432 “ gentlemen, This Society, feeling as they do, the grievous effects of the present corrupt state defects, and abuse of our country ; the great and heavy oppressions which the common mass of the people labour under, as the natural consequence of that corruption ; and at the same time being sensible, toa degree of certainty, that the public minds, and general sentiments of the people, are determined to obtain, A RADICAL REFORM OF THE COUNTRY, as soon as prudence and discretion will permit, believes it their duty to make use of every prudent means, as far as their abilities can be extended, to obtain so salutary and desirable an object as a thorough reformation of our country. For these reasons, with great deference and submission to the members of the Society for Constitutional Information in London, we beg leave to request that they will be pleased to admit the persons of the following names annexed hereto as members of their society (they being our friends, and members of our society), in order that a close connexion may be formed, and a regular communication maintained, between the two bodies ; that, being thus strengthened this society may be better enabled to govern itself with more propriety, and to render assistance to their fellow-citizens in this neighbourhood, and in parts more remote ; that they, in their turn, may extend useful knowledge still farther, from town to village, and from village to town, until the whole nation be sufficiently enlightened, and united in the same cause, which cannot fail of being the case wherever the most excellent works of Mr. Thomas Paine find residence. I am, gentlemen, your most respectful and sincere triend

BOWER 10435 In that part where it says— “the people are determined to obtain a radiword originally, where the word country is now 
OAKES 10436 I do not know ; it is not intelligible. 
BOWER 10437 Do you know how those two letters of te same date came to be sent on the same day
OAKES 10438 No, I do not. 
BOWER 10439 Did you ever hear of this letter, which I have now desired you to read, before it was written, or afterwards 
OAKES 10440 I do not recollectit 
BOWER 10441 Do you not recollect hearing of that leter at all
OAKES 10442 I do not. 
BOWER 10443 That was a letter then composed by the scret committee, which never was communcated to you, at least ? 
BOWER 10444 Oakes. By the secret committee ? 
BOWER 10445 By the committee 
OAKES 10446 It never was. 
BOWER 10447 It never was comm inicated, to your know ledge, to the society 
OAKES 10448 I do not know, tecause I did not attend all the society's meetings. 
BOWER 10449 I ask whether, to your knowledge, it ever was communicated to the society 
OAKES 10450 I cannet answer to that. 
EYRE 10451 Do you know whether it was, or was not
OAKES 10452 I do not know whether it was, or not. 
BOWER 10453 You say you were present at the meeting at the Castle-hill 
OAKES 10454 I was. 
BOWER 10455 Did you hear Yorke’s speech there 
OAKES 10456 Yes. 
BOWER 10457 Have you read it since it was printed
OAKES 10458 I have not. 
BOWER 10459 Have you never read his speech 
OAKES 10460 No; I have not. 
BOWER 10461 Did you know Mr. Brown 
OAKES 10462 Yes. 
BOWER 10463 Was he the editor of the Patriot, I mes the gentleman sent as alee Matthee Campbell Brown 
OAKES 10464 I do not know. 
BOWER 10465 Did you ever read a paper at Sheffield under he name of the Patriot? 
BOWER 10466 jakes—Do you mean a newspaper, or 3 book which calor outin numbers? 
BOWER 10467 T believe it came out both ways; did you ever read either of them
OAKES 10468 I have read frequently the register, which might contain extracts from the Patriot, Mr. Gale’s register. 
BOWER 10469 Did you read the book that was published under the title of the Patriot 
OAKES 10470 I read several of them. 
EYRE 10471 What was the title of the register 
OAKES 10472 The Sheffield Register. 
EYRE 10473 A newspaper, published weekly 
OAKES 10474 Yes. 
BOWER 10475 Look at the resolutions in the printed paper pasted into that book. 
BOWER 10476 Oakes
OAKES 10477 Will you give me leave to read them over? 
ERSKINE 10478 Do you temember that paper ; do you know any thing of it 
OAKES 10479 I camDot tell. 
BOWER 10480 Read it over aloud ; it bas been read already. 
ERSKINE 10481 That is a very good ressoa why he need not read it aloud again. 
BOWER 10482 Now, upon your oath, were’ 
BOWER 10483 those resolutions, or ques copies of them, circulated at Sheffield as the resolutions of your society 
OAKES 10484 Yes; I believe they were. 
BOWER 10485 You have seen them in circulation there; have you not 
OAKES 10486 I think so? 
BOWER 10487 Did you at that time, or your society, circulate the books which are referred to in those resolutions—I mean this part, “ we declare that we have derived more true knowledge from the two works of Mr. Thomas Paine, intituled,Rights of Man, part the first and second than from any other author on the subject— the practice, as well as the principle of government, is laid down in those works in a manner so clear and irresistibly convincing, that this society do hereby resolve to give their thanks to Mr. Paine for his two said publications, intituled Rights of Man, part the first and second
OAKES 10488 Never since they were proved to be a libel. 
BOWER 10489 Iam not talking about their being proved to bea libel, but whether these books were circulated by your society, about Sheffield, as the principles of government which you had, adopted
OAKES 10490 They were, before they were proved to be a libel. 
BOWER 10491 Were they circulated by the members of your society, in the neighbourhood of Sheftield, in very great numbers 
OAKES 10492 Indeed I cannot answer that. 
BOWER 10493 Do you know that they were circulated by the members of that society at all
OAKES 10494 Yes; He were, before they were proved to be a ibel. 
BOWER 10495 I beg it to be understood that the question has nothing todo with proved to be a libel ; but were they not, in fact, circulated 
OAKES 10496 They were sold to various persons, both in the town and country. 
BOWER 10497 By whom ; by Gale
OAKES 10498 I do not know whether Gale sold any or not ; I believe he did. 
BOWER 10499 By whom, do you know, were they circulated—were they circulated by the members of that society, to your knowledge 
OAKES 10500 Yes. 
BOWER 10501 ho was this David Martin, who signs those resolutions as chairman of your committee 
OAKES 10502 He was not constantly chairman. 
BOWER 10503 Was he, at the time those resolutions passed 
OAKES 10504 I do not know that I was present when they were passed. 
BOWER 10505 Did you not know the time till asked you to the time now
OAKES 10506 Yes; I knew they were circulated as such. 
BOWER 10507 Did you not know he was chairman 
OAKES 10508 I knew it by his name being to the minutes. 
BOWER 10509 How many members had you about this time in the Constitutional Society 
OAKES 10510 I do not know. 
BOWER 10511 Do you mean to say you do not know whether there were twenty-five hundred, or ten thousand 
OAKES 10512 I cannot answer to the particular number of the society. 
BOWER 10513 As near as you can
OAKES 10514 I do not wish to speak any thing but the truth. 
BOWER 10515 As Mear as you can ? 
EYRE 10516 Give short, clear distinct answers; that is the way to convince every body that you speak the truth, 
ERSKINE 10517 They are asking the number of members, at a distinct period of time, in a society the numbers af which were fluctuating. 
BOWER 10518 About how many 
OAKES 10519 Probably there might be about two hundred. 
BOWER 10520 How came you to say, in your resolutions, that they were increased to nearly two thowsand, if they were only two hundred
OAKES 10521 There were many that were friends to the plans that we were proposing and adopting, that were not regularly entered into the society as members. 
BOWER 10522 You begin by stating, “ This society, com posed chiefly of the manufacturers of Sheffield, egan about four months ago, and is already increased to nearly two thousand members, and is daily increasing ; was not that fifteen, sixteen, or eighteen hundred more than you had at the time
OAKES 10523 Probably that might be taken from the number of people that attended the meeting at that time. 
BOWER 10524 Did people attend the meetings who were not members 
OAKES 10525 Yes, at the first beginning. 
BOWER 10526 Had you any meeting at which five husdred persons were got together, before the month of March, 1792
OAKES 10527 I believe there were. 
BOWER 10528 I observed, when you were examined, you said you had no intention to attack government; what did you mean that you had no intention to attack government; if government had attacked you, and dispersed you, what were you to do
OAKES 10529 We had no designs at all to attack government by force of arms. 
BOWER 10530 Supposing government had attempted to disperse you
OAKES 10531 We should have submitted to it, 
BOWER 10532 You do not know, you said, whether there wasany intentionatall aboutaltering the House of Lords, or about the House of Lords in any respect 
OAKES 10533 We expected a fair and equal representation in the House of Commons; that if there were any corruptions in the House of Lords, that a reformation of that would follow of course. 
BOWER 10534 Then, after all you have stated to me of those resolutions, and those works you have before stated, you mean now to state that your idea was a mere reform by petition to parliament, and nothing more
OAKES 10535 It was. 
BOWER 10536 Was Martin, the person who signed this, the last witness 
OAKES 10537 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10538  You said, when you had obtained an equal representation in the House of Commons, if there was any corruption in the House of Lords, a reformation there would follow of course—do you mean that that would follow, in consequence of an act of parliament made by the King, the Lords, and the House of Commons, restored to its purity, as you wished it
OAKES 10539 Yes. 
BOWER 10540 That is a leading question. 
ERSKINE 10541 Though there was no fixed time for your committee’s reporting what pessed before them, whether reports were not made from time to time, and all the procecdings published in the papers
OAKES 10542 I believe there were. 
ERSKINE 10543 Was there any concealment of what you did 
OAKES 10544 I believe there was not. 
ERSKINE 10545 Were not the letters, which you have heard read in court here, from time to time, printed in the newspapers at the time
OAKES 10546 I cannot answer for that. 
ERSKINE 10547 But did you not advertise frequently in the newspapers, the procecdings and letters that you had 
OAKES 10548 I believe the proceedings of the society were, in general, published in the newspapers, 
BOWER 10549 Did that book, called the Patriot, come out about the same time as the newspaper 
OAKES 10550 Tine newspapers came out long before the Patrivt. 
ERSKINE 10551 1I call this gentleman, who has been examined before, in consequence of the evidence which your lordship has now been attending to; this gentleman is secretary to the Friends of the People, in Frithstreet, London, whose proccedings are before the Court.

STUART 10552 I have.

STUART 10554 Yes, they had. 
LAW 10555  What is the date ? 
ERSKINE 10556 The 14th of May, 1792. At what time did the Society of the Friends of the People first institute themselves, and publish their Declaration; have you one about you 
STUART 10557 I have; here— it is the proceedings of the society, printed under my own inspection. 
ERSKINE 10558 Does this letter refer to this address

ERSKINE 10560 We will read the letter first, and then the address. 
EYRE 10561  What is the date of the Declaration you speak of? 
ERSKINE 10562 The title of it is—“ A Declaration, agreed to on the 11th of April, 1792, by the Society, intituled, The Friends of the People, associated for the purpose of obtaining a Parliamentary Reform. 
EYRE 10563  When published?

ERSKINE 10565 It was transmitted to Ashton; and this letter is the answer of Ashton upon the receipt of it.

As our members increase, the number of meeting places are increased in proportion, so as not to exceed at most thirty members at one place. All the circular meetings are held. once a fortnight, on the same evening ; our general meeting is held once a month, at three different houses, on the same day, generally very crowded, De good order and regularity is strictly attended to : and we doubt not, but what has been suggested to be impossible, will be fully manifested to be not only practicable, but easy to accomplish, viz. to introduce useful knowledge, good order, and regularity, into the minds and morals of the common, or lower

JURYMEMBER 10611 who constitute the Society of the Friends of the People, but if we may presume to lay before them some thoughts, we have had, respecting what method would be best to adopt for obtaining the gencral sense of the nation, before the proposed motion in the next session of parliament takes place, we'be leave, with great deference to that honourable society, to submit the following to their superior judgment; we believe, the most likely and effectual plan will be to establish a convention in London, by deputies from each county, or district, ‘xy which means the sentiments of the nation may be obtained without any confusion or disorder. 
JURYMEMBER 10612 “ Looking up to the Friends of the People as eur leaders, and directors, in the great and necessary business, we shall be happy, and esteem it a great favour, to receive any communication which they may vouchsafe to 
JURYMEMBER 10613 Sir; We beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, of the 14th instant, and to return you our thanks for a confident which, we trust, our future conduct will mest from our country. 
JURYMEMBER 10614 “We have received sincere pleasure, only from the firm and virtuous tone in which you have spoken your principles, but from te wise and temperate manner in which yo have limited their application to practice— We rejoice ‘that our sentiments, our Representatives, and our plans of reform are perfectly it unison with your ideas.’ The great body of the people corresponding to such ‘sea ments’ will equally confound the two opposilt classes of enemies to the public weal; thatit will defeat the hopes of those who would due the people into tumult, and that it will slee the slanders of those advocates of corruption, who haye laboured to render the caus 
JURYMEMBER 10615 Jiberty odious and terrible to all good citizens, by confounding it with principles of anarchy, end by Joading it with the obloquy of provoking civil commotion, and of en angering the destruction of a constitution justly NG nowned for the freedom and happiness whic! it has so long bestowed. You are pleased to say that ‘ you look up to the Friends of the People as your leaders and directors in this great business :’ authorized as we feel ourselves by this proffered guidance, and by that harmony of sentiment, which from the tenor of your letter, we must suppose to exist between you and ourselves, permit us to lay before you some ideas which are dictated by zeal for our common cause. The cause of liberty can never be endangered by the assault of its enemies, but may sometimes be exposed by the indiscretion of its friends; its principles are fourded on impregnable reason, and its enemies are, therefore; too dexterous directly, to attack them. It is not against the reasonings of the champions of corruption (for they have produced none), but it is against their craft and their misrepresentation that we have found it necessary to defend ourselves by the wariness of our language and our conduct. A similar wariness, as far as the authority of our opinion can extend, we must counsel all societies associated on similar principles, for the accomplishment of the same object, to preserve; accused as they are, in common with ourselves, of meditating one object and holding forth another, of seducing the people by a measure so specious and salutary as parliamentary reform, into other measures of desperate tendency and undefinable extent, we can only advise them to follow our example in honestly, and solemnly declaring that ‘ they make the preservation of “the constitution, on its true principles, the “foundation of all their proceedings’ and the measure of all their reforms
STUART 10616 Language thus explicit will effectually combat misrepresentations to which, perhaps, ardent indiscretion may have sometimes furnished pretexts. An early declaration of these opinions, which we sincerely believe you to entertain, will conciliate: many to the cause of a reform who are now held in honest neutrality by their fears, The friends of order, aftcr sucha declaration, justified by consistent conduct, will be no lonver driven to seek refuge from anarchy in the bosom of corruption. The interested supporters of the present abuses will thus be disarmed, for it is only by confounding reform with commotion, and corruption with the British constitution, that they are enabled ta prolong and to defend their usurpations. All’ 
JURYMEMBER 10617 our language, as you will perceive from the roceedings which we transmit to you, has m cautious, because al) our views are moderate; we are persuaded that you have a similar moderation of views, and we earnestly exhort you to a similar caution in language. It is only, indeed, with Societies, who express the same ration of principles, and adopt the same wariness of language, that this society can entertain any correspondence, or promise any co-operation ; we have publicly disclaimed what we condemn, as well as avowed our real object, and on an occasion unsought for by us. In conformity with this principle we have. been compelled to decline all intercourse with the Society for Constitutional Information in London; for though we never wish to attack, nor pretend to dictate, we are certainly entitled to decline all intercoyrse with men whose views and principles appear to us irreconcileable with ottrs. 
JURYMEMBER 10618 “On the particular measure which you suggest for collecting the opinion of the people on the subject of reform, we do not feel ourselves yet prepared to decide; in a more advanced stage of the business it may become very fit matter for deliberation. 
JURYMEMBER 10619 “Permit us, sir, to conclude with congratulating you and congratulating our country, on the admirable principles which your letter contains, and on the intrepid moderation which it entitles us to expect from you: you will deprive our enemies of every pretext for counterfeiting alarms which they do not feel, and of every opportunity to defeat our measures by calumniating our intentions.

JURYMEMBER 10621 o Samuel Ashton, esq. secretary to the Society for Constiei Information, in Shefeld. 
ERSKINE 10622 Have you any letter received from the Hertfordshire Society 
STUART 10623 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10624 Is that the letter? [showing it to the witness.]—This is the letter, dated October 1st, 1792. 
ERSKINE 10625 Was it read to the Society 
STUART 10626 It was. 
ERSKINE 10627 The clerk will now read this letter. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10628 We have not named that Society. 
ERSKINE 10629 I do not give up my right to read it. I will argue it by-and-by. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10630 The letter that has last been read you say’ you took to Mr. Grey to be signed 
STUART 10631 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10632 It was signed
STUART 10633 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10634 Did you send the letter by the post, or deliver it yourself to Mr. Ashton 
STUART 10635 I sent it by the post to Sheffield. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10636 Did you know Mr. Ashton
STUART 10637 Not personally then. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10638 Do you know what Mr. Ashton is
STUART 10639 Yes; a currier, or tanner, I believe, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10640 What was he at that time 
STUART 10641 I suppose in’ the same business, I have no doubt he was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10642 I see you direct to Samuel Ashton, esq.
STUART 10643 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10644 ThatI suppose was a thought of your own? It was not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10645 By whose direction did you direct it to Samuel Ashton, esq.
STUART 10646 By the direction of the committee. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10647 Did any of them know Mr. Ashton’s situation in life
STUART 10648 I believe none of them knew Mr. Ashton at that time. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10649 You told us the other day, when you were here, that you did not know that Mr. Hardy had been an associated member of the Constitutional Society 
STUART 10650 I did not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10651 jouseeyour letter is of the 24th of May
STUART 10652 Yes, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10653 Do you know, that the same Mr. Ashton, upon the 26th of the same month, wrote to the Constitutional Society, in London, a letter, which I hold now in my hand, stating, that he had received your moderate letter, the letter of the Friends of the People; an stating, to that Society, that, as your principles were not according to the rights of man, the Sheffield Society would have nothing ‘to do with you, except so far as the Constitutional Society would afterwards permit
STUART 10654 I never heard of such a letter before. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10655 Have you had any communication with Mr. Ashton since
STUART 10656 About a twelvemonth ago Mr. Ashton was in town, and called upon me. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10657 A short time previous to this, I think about the 27th of March, your Society, the Friends of the People, had expressed their reasons for having nothing to do with the Constitutional Society; and had stated to them, that the would have no more correspondence with them
STUART 10658 I think that was about the beginning of May. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10659 It was before this letter of your's to Sheffield 
STUART 10660 It was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10661 Did you know, that twelve members of that very Sheffield Society, to which you were writing, had been associated with the Constitutional Society, whose correspondence you had before rejected
STUART 10662 I am not sure; I had read it in the newspapers; but I cannot say certainly whether I knew it or not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10663 Do you mean to say, that, at the time you permitted this letter to go from the Friends of the People, to Sheffield, that you knew that that Sheffield Society had twelve members associated with that Constitutional Society, with whom your Society had refused to correspond 
STUART 10664 At the time of sending that answer, I did not think ofany such thing. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10665 T do not mean to insinuate that you did, for I do not believe that you did—then, you did not know that fact
STUART 10666 No; but, I believe, T heard of it afterwards. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10667 You observed my learned friend read to you a great many very respectable names; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10668 ow many of those gentlemen have quitted your society 
STUART 10669 I suppose about a dozen. 
ERSKINE 10670  and you can tell how many have been added to it ? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10671 Your society received this letter of the 14th, from Sheffield, as a proof of their moderation
STUART 10672 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10673 And you treated it so, of course, and knew nothing of the letter that, on the 26th of May, they wrote to the Constitutional Society, such as I have been stating to you 
STUART 10674 No;I did not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10675 You were going to state, that some gentle. men had left your society about this time
STUART 10676 Yes; there were. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10677 Do you recollect the names of them
STUART 10678 Five gentlemen left the society at once ; their letter is printed in those proceedings; Mr. Baker, lord John Russell, Mr. Courtenay, Mr. Dudley North, and Mr. Curwen. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10679 Have you had the curiosity to read over the names of those respectable gentlemen, whose names are printed jn this list Certainly. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10680 Can you inform me how many of those entlemen were, and continue to be mem ie of that Constitutional Society, all corre pondence with which you had rejected
STUART 10681 I can only know from hearsay. 
ERSKINE 10682 You will state the names— I believe Mr. Goring is, but he bas withdrawn frem the Friends of the People. 
ERSKINE 10683 Dr. Towers is a member of the Friends of the People, and the Constitutional Society 
STUART 10684 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10685 Major Cartwright
STUART 10686 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10687 Mr. Batley
STUART 10688 I do not know that Mr. Batley, senior. 
ERSKINE 10689 Mr. Thompson 
STUART 10690 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10691 Mr. Walker 
STUART 10692 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10693 Mr. Sharpe
STUART 10694 I do not know that Mr. Sharpe is a member of the Constitutional Society. 
ERSKINE 10695 You will tell us, Mr. At torncy General, which you know to be members of the Constitutional Society, it will save the time of the Court; I know the fact myself, that they do continue to be members. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10696 When did Ms. Wharton become a member of your Society
STUART 10697 I believe, before I had any thing to do with it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10698 I presume you always inquired who the persons were that you addressed your letters to, before you wrote an; thing to them !—Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10699 Is lord Daer a member of your society
STUART 10700 Yes, he is. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10701 I understood you to say, there was an aiswer to your letter of the 24th of May, from Sheffield? —Yes ; there was. Was that from the same Mr. Ashton
STUART 10702 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10703 In as moderate terms as the letter you bad answered 
STUART 10704 Yes, approving entirely of that answer which has been read. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10705 Do you remember whether that letter, in those moderate terms, was dated before or after the 26th of ag hice must have beea dated after, because the answer was on 24th of May, and this is the reply to that answer. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10706 It might have been written by the retura of the post 
STUART 10707 That would not do. 
ERSKINE 10708  The reply to your answer was in the same moderate terms, which must have been later than the 26th
STUART 10709 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10710 You were asked, by the attorney general, whether lord Selkirk’s eldest ur, le Daer, was and is a member of the society of the Friends of the People 
STUART 10711 He certainly is. 
ERSKINE 10712 Did not every body know that lord Daer had been in the British Convention, at Edinburgh 
STUART 10713 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10714 Every gentlernss in the Society of the Friends of the People, knew that lord Daer was a delegate there
STUART 10715 Yes; I believe they all knew; it was in the public papers. 
ERSKINE 10716 Does he remain still a member of the Friends of the People 
STUART 10717 He does. 
ERSKINE 10718 Was there any motion made to expel him, or question his conduct on that account 
STUART 10719 None at all. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10720 Did your society know what had been the proceedings of the British Convention; I do not speak of the Scotch Convention, but the British Convention 
STUART 10721 They knew from the public papers, I believe ; nothing farther. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10722 I observe you say, the answer must be dated later than the 26th
STUART 10723 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10724 Why
STUART 10725 it is a reply to an answer signed by Mr. Grey; the letter was dated the 24th of May; it will take two days to gu to Sheffield, and two days to bring up a reply. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10726 If your letter went from London on the 24th, and was answered by the return of post, the date of the answer must be the 26th? 
ERSKINE 10727 Did you ever know a man 
ERSKINE 10728 ; change from a constitutional man, to a republican, in one post? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10729 Did you ever know a man who was both a republican and a constitutional man, in one post ? 
EYRE 10730 The observations upon this transaction are in a much larger and higher scale than this. 
ERSKINE 10731  What is your trade
STUART 10732 A razor maker, at How long were you a member of the society?—Nearly from first forming of the to the last. 
ERSKINE 10733 Did you attend regularly, in general 
STUART 10734 I did. 
ERSKINE 10735 What was your object in ming first, and afterwards continuing to be a member of that society 
STUART 10736 The object that I had in view, was a reformation in the Commons House of Parliament. 
ERSKINE 10737 By what means did you seek to obtain that reform, by the associations that were taking place at that time 
STUART 10738 By petitioning the House of Parliament. 
ERSKINE 10739 Why did you expect that petitioning, by having associations, and delegations from those associations, would be more successful than the ordinary way of petitioning 
STUART 10740 We adopted the’ plan of the duke of Richmond; that was the idea that I formed of the business. 
ERSKINE 10741 From what you heard pass, and from the general proceedings of the society, had you any reason to believe, or have you now, while 
ERSKINE 10742 I am examining you, any reason to believethat the object of the society, in general, was different from your own
STUART 10743 I have not; from the knowledge I have of the society, I believe that they had only one end in view. 
ERSKINE 10744 Which was the same end you had
STUART 10745 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10746 You recollect, no doubt, the obligation under which you speak—that you are sworn to speak the truth
STUART 10747 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10748 Then recollecting the sanction and solemnity under which you speak, do you declare it solemnly to be your helief now, ‘that that was the general object of your society 
STUART 10749 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10750 If you had had any reason to believe that they intended to subvert the government— for as to touching the life of the king it is indecent to state it—if you had any reason to believe that they had the least idea to subvert the king’s authority, would you have belonged to the society 
STUART 10751 No. 
ERSKINE 10752 If, having belonged to it, you had afterwards discovered that thet was the object of the society, would you have continued in it
STUART 10753 No; I should lave immediately withdrawn from it. 
ERSKINE 10754 If you had discovered—I am not talking of your own internal ideas, which indeed you have already communicated to us—but if you had discovered, from the conduct of the society, not what any one intemperate man might say or do, but if you had discovered, from the general conduct of that society, that its intention was mischievous, and that it meant to accomplish its purposes by force, would you have continued in it
STUART 10755 No; I would immediately have withdrawn as soon as I had formed an idea that they were meaning 10 obtain it by force. 
ERSKINE 10756 ere you a member of the society when it sent a delegate to the Convention in Scotland
STUART 10757 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10758 What did you understand your delegate was to do, representing your society in the Convention in Scotland; I mean what you understood, from what was said in your society at the time 
STUART 10759 That they were to associate together, in order to inform the minds of the people, and to draw up such papers, to be presented to government, as they thought would be most conducive to bringing about a reformation in the Commons House of Parliament. 
ERSKINE 10760 When this Mr. Campbell Brown was sent to Edinburgh, was he authorized to proceed in any way, towards any object, but the same constitutional objects which the society itself had in view
STUART 10761 No ; he had no other authority, but acting upon the same principle that the society had always done, Do you remember at what time there was any alarm spread in your society upon the subject ?—I recollect, but I cannot justly mention when. 
ERSKINE 10762 Do you remember a hand-bill
STUART 10763 I have no knowledge of the hand-bill. 
ERSKINE 10764 Do you remember any insults on offered to the society, or to any of its members 
STUART 10765 I have seen people repeatedly assembled together, and have heard them speak repeattlly of assaulting the society; and, from inflammatory letters that were published in the Sheffield paper, by one George Russell, it very much alarmed the people of the society at Sheffield. 
ERSKINE 10766 Upon that occasion did you hear any thing said about the society having any pikes, or any thing for its defence 
STUART 10767 No; I am almost a stranger to the pike business; I have heard it mentioned, but know little of it. 
ERSKINE 10768 If the design of the society had been, in general, to provide arms to carry on its objects, must you not have heard of it 
STUART 10769 Certainly. 
ERSKINE 10770 Were you ever in the committee 
STUART 10771 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10772 Was it ever proposed by the committee to the society, or from the society to the committee, or ever mentioned in the society, that you were to have arms for your defence, against the government, or for an attack upon it
STUART 10773 No; it is a question that was never agitated in the committee, nor in the society. 
ERSKINE 10774 Then, until these people were taken up, aud this unfortunate business, which detains us here, originated—I ask you, as an honest man, whether you ever heard of such thing in your life, as arming, either to resist government, or to attack it
STUART 10775 No; I never beard of it, either before, or since. 
ERSKINE 10776 Had you any views, in the object of your association, which extended beyond the Commons House of Parliament
STUART 10777 No, we had not; I had not for my own part, and I reasonably hope that the society had not. 
ERSKINE 10778 Isthat reasonable hope founded upon what you observed of their proceedings 
STUART 10779 Yes; I never saw any thing to the contrary. 
ERSKINE 10780 You say the duke of Richmond’s plan was the object
STUART 10781 The nly object that I had in view, and the only object I ever understood that the society at large had in view. 
ERSKINE 10782 Was the object which the society at large had in view, the duke of Richmond’s plan, stated from time to time in the society
STUART 10783  Yes, frequently stated, and a number of the duke of Richmond's letters to colonel Sharman were published by the society. 
ERSKINE 10784 The society, in order to show that that was their object, published that letter to colonel Sharman? What was the reason of your society for circulating this letter 
STUART 10785 It was for sole purpose of informing the society at large of the principles upon which they intended to go. 
ERSKINE 10786 From every thing then that you know of the poate of your owa Enowlecee, from your regular attendance uport it, did they tell to you to adhere to that object
STUART 10787 Yes, strictly. 
LAW 10788  You have said that it was your object to obtain a reform by petitioning parliament, was it your object all along to obtain a reform by petitioning parliament
DEWSNAP 10789 It was.

DEWSNAP 10801 Yes, I might see it, but I recollect very little of it.

DEWSNAP 10803 I belicve it was negatived.

DEWSNAP 10805 I do not know that there was.

DEWSNAP 10809 No, I did not; I remained. 
LAW 10810 Do you know of a single member havirz afterwards, in consequence of that vote, which you said you read in Gale’s paper, withdrawn himself from that society
DEWSNAP 10811 No, I do not;do not recollect a single individual. 
LAW 10812 Do you know whether the proceedings of the British Convention were not approved by your society 
DEWSNAP 10813 That is a matter that I am a stranger to, whether they approved or disapproved. 
LAW 10814 Pires not there a vote of approbation in society of the proceedings of that convention
DEWSNAP 10815 I have some recollection of it, but I was not there present, neither can I give any distint account of that.

LAW 10817 Then do you believe, or not, that it was or not put for the purpose of being negatived

ERSKINE 10868 ‘ apply tothe magistrates or government forwhen this business happened, these people. your defence, in case any of you were attackedwere taken up 
DEWSNAP 10869 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10870 and illegally dispersed; do you recollect any proposition of that kind
DEWSNAP 10871 I do not. 
ERSKINE 10872  What was your object in being a member of it
DEWSNAP 10873 To obtain a parliamentary reform, 
ERSKINE 10874 What did you mean by a parliamentary reform 
DEWSNAP 10875 Upon the sume plan as the duke of 
ERSKINE 10876 If there had been any proposition, muchRichmond and Mr. Pitt. 
ERSKINE 10877 more if there had been any preparation for 
ERSKINE 10878 Had you any of the duke of Richmond’s arming for such purposes, must you not haveletters to colonel Sharman 
DEWSNAP 10879 Yes, we had. 
ERSKINE 10880 heard it 
DEWSNAP 10881 Yes, and had the idea of arming been general, there undoubtedly would havepamphlet to the witness.]—Yes ; been Jarge numbers of those pikes manufac-is. 
ERSKINE 10882 tured in Sheffield. 
ERSKINE 10883 rinted 
ERSKINE 10884 Is that one of them? piers 4 p ieve it 
ERSKINE 10885 I suppose this was read in the society fre 
ERSKINE 10886 At the time that this petition to parliamentquently 
DEWSNAP 10887 It was at times. 
ERSKINE 10888 was negatived, the delegates had not been sent to Scotland 
DEWSNAP 10889 No. 
ERSKINE 10890 Do you remember this passage—“ Another subject of apprehension is, that the principle 
ERSKINE 10891 Was the petition that was negatived, a pe-| of allowing to every man an equal right to tition from the people of Sheffield, or a peti-vote, tends to equality in other respects, and tion from the delegates 
DEWSNAP 10892 A petition from theto level property. To me it seems to have a people of Sheftield. direct contrary tendency. ‘Lhe equal rights of 
ERSKINE 10893 But was it ever voted that the delegates, men to oy from optression, and to the after they had assembled together to considerenjoyments of life and liberty, strikes me the best means of attaining it, was it ever| as perfectly compatible with their unequal voted that they should not petition
DEWSNAP 10894 No, I doshares of industry, labour, and genius, which not know that the question ever was moved, ] are the origin of inequality of fortunes. The uality and inequality of men, are both fundel in pe and Thilst we do not confound the two, and only support her establishments, we cannot err. Now when you talked of the Rights of man in your society, I cannot ask what other people understood, but what did you understand by it yourself?—Equal representation in fasternent. 
ERSKINE 10895 ‘Did you mean any thing connected with France
DEWSNAP 10896 No. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10897 What did he amean? 
ERSKINE 10898 Or did you mean what you said now, equal representation in parliament
DEWSNAP 10899 Yes. 
ERSKINE 10900 In what branch of parliament 
DEWSNAP 10901 The House of Commons. 
ERSKINE 10902 If you had observed, from attending upon the society, that other people’s objects were different from those you have expressed to be your own, would you have continued in it 
DEWSNAP 10903 N ot a day. 
ERSKINE 10904 And though you had not clearly discovered it, if you had only reason to believe, or suspectit
DEWSNAP 10905 I never heard any thing in the society, as a body, like it. 
ERSKINE 10906 Did you ever hear any thing in the society that ied you to believe that they wished to attack the king’s title, or attack the prerogative ofthecrown
DEWSNAP 10907 Not in the least, much the other bia you ever hear, in the society, any resolution concerning the House of Lords ?—N ever, not to touch the dignity of the House of Lords; the plan we went upon was the same as in 1688, 
ERSKINE 10908 What do you mean by 1688
DEWSNAP 10909 The glorious advantages that we obtained by the revolution of 1688. 
ERSKINE 10910 You say you looked up to the duke of Richmond’s plan ; Task, upon your oath, whether you had any reason to believe that this plan of the duke of Richmond’s, or any other plan, was to be endeavoured to be accomplished by force
DEWSNAP 10911 Never, not by us as a body. 
ERSKINE 10912 Did you ever hear in the society, in the course of your being there, any determination of carrying this by force of arms, not merely by your society, ina body, but your society and others joining
DEWSNAP 10913 Never. 
ERSKINE 10914 When was it that you heard of arming in Sheffield; if you ever did hear of arming
DEWSNAP 10915 Never till there were papers flung about in the streets, and likewise advertisements in the Courant, at Sheffield. 
ERSKINE 10916 “ What effect had these papers, thrown about in the strects, and the advertisements in the Courant 
DEWSNAP 10917 It was calling forth the people of Sheffield to stand forth, and destroy all the people of a different persuasion from themselves, and it was signed G. Russel, a clergyan. 
ERSKINE 10918 Did that letter, and things ofa similar sort, produce any alarm in the minds of the socicty
DEWSNAP 10919 In some it did ; and I can relate another circumstance :, frequently when there was any kind of rejoicing in Sheffield, at good news from the continent, it was the practice o what we call the opposite party, to come ani fire pistols even into the windows of the de. mocrats, as they called us; they even fd into my chamber window when I was in bei 
ERSKINE 10920 When this good news from the continent came, had you said any thing in the socet calculated to damp the joy which such gud news might infuse 
DEWSNAP 10921 Not atall. — 
ERSKINE 10922 Had your society assembled to disturb thea in any thing they should say or do abouts victory 
DEWSNAP 10923 Not at all. 
ERSKINE 10924 Had you given any offence of any kin them, to your knowledge 
DEWSNAP 10925 No, I had mt been from my work. 
ERSKINE 10926 Notwithstanding that, did your societyet: regularly arm themselves 
DEWSNAP 10927 Never. 
ERSKINE 10928 as there any proposition ever, that ty should have armed themselves to have rea ed the magistrates
DEWSNAP 10929 No ; if it had been de termined to resist, Sheffield, in one day, cau have furnished ten thousand pikes, ifitts! been determined, but it never was a matters! determination or consideration of the soarty. 
ERSKINE 10930 Whether you had then reason, or haveto to believe that there was any detennmi in the society to pursue such means 
DEWSNAP 10931 Allb; peace and good order, acondng to the lavai the land; that was always held forth ata the meetings that ever I attended. 5; 
ERSKINE 10932 You say they used to call you a demom!: —Yes, 
ERSKINE 10933 As a person that did not love the king! do not know what they might think. 
ERSKINE 10934 You can tell how you feltit in yourmind’ understood by the word democrat thatl wit ed a more equal representation in the Howe of Commons, but never by any violence f 
ERSKINE 10935 Had you ever any wish in your owD ar or was it your object in becoming 4 me of that society, to touch or affect your 9 reign in any respect
DEWSNAP 10936 Never. 
ERSKINE 10937 5 help you God, is that s0 
DEWSNAP 10938 It is. 
GARROW 10939 I shall not trouble you with the quests the gentleman has Fepeaiel several is whether you are a traitor, and ought 0 hanged; I shall not ask you whetber have been guilty of high treason, ea These papers that were thrown abot streets at Sheffield, alarmed, very consider) you, who were called democrats 
SMITH 10940 Ye 
GARROW 10941 And made it, as you thought, ness that you should procure arms for your defence 
SMITH 10942 Yes. ala, 
GARROW 10943 To what extent now did this dreadful arm, which made it neces: to procure as your own defence go; how many P these arm themselves in cot ce 0 
GARROW 10944 dreadful alarms 
SMITH 10945 That I cannot tell; it "2 never a med of the society, and t is innpossible to say that. 
GARROW 10946 You have been asked a good deal your own conduct, no doubt you P! had oot musket and bayonet 
SMITH 10947 No, I never of te in my life, nor dagger, nor any thing Sort. 
GARROW 10948 Nor pike 
SMITH 10949 No. 
GARROW 10950 Upon your oath, you had neither a musket nor a pike
SMITH 10951 No. 
GARROW 10952 Netwithstanding all this dread and excitation in the streets, you still continued to kee yourself unarmed 
SMITH 10953 I kept myself as muci as possible in my own house. 
GARROW 10954 Which of the magistrates was it you applied to, for you forgot to mention his name, to prevent these desperate people from destroying you all
SMITH 10955 We applicd to po magiswate 
GARROW 10956 I beg pardon, I made a mistake, it was the secretary of state you applied tof—No, asa society we never applied. 
GARROW 10957 I thought we did not understand one another; which of the magistrates was it that, as an individual, you applied to
SMITH 10958 None. 
GARROW 10959 You applicd to the secretary of state perhaps
SMITH 10960 No. 
GARROW 10961 Did any body apply 
SMITH 10962 No. 
GARROW 10963 Did you not communicate these alarming threats toany body 
SMITH 10964 They were daily in the rs. 
GARROW 10965 ‘ou made no application to any body 
SMITH 10966 In the paper—in the register it was put, that we advised people to arm to assist the magistrates. 
GARROW 10967 You are an accurate man; I see you take the duke of Richmond’s and Mr. Pitt’s plan, and all these things, most perfectly; there were papers thrown about the streets, desiring the opposite party, opposite to the democrats, to destroy all people of a different persuasion 
SMITH 10968 Yes, it was in the Courant. 
GARROW 10969 That was the same paper that desired people to arm against foreign invasion and domestic enemies
SMITH 10970 I do not know what that was. 
GARROW 10971 Did pee ever see any paper distributed in Sheffield by the opposite party, except that paper that I describe, as an invitation to arm against domestic enemies and foreign invasion 
SMITH 10972 It was that I named in the Courant. 
GARROW 10973 Upon which your society immediately adopted. their words, and advised the democrats to arm, for the protection of property? 
ERSKINE 10974 Is that a proper question? 
EYRE 10975 It is no question ;. it is an assertion. 
GARROW 10976 Did not your society adopt the very words of it, as an invitation for the people to arm, for the protection of property
SMITH 10977 As far as they advised people to arm, it was according to the rules of the constitution. 
GARROW 10978 Did they not adopt the very language of that paper, which you stated to be an excitement
SMITH 10979 Words similar to it; we had some apprehensions from it. 
GARROW 10980 And did you not, in consequence of that apprehension, adopt the very words 
SMITH 10981 Similar ones to it. 
GARROW 10982 The duke of Richmond’s plan, and Mr. Pitt’s, were the things you adopted 
SMITH 10983 Yes. 
GARROW 10984 Have the goodness to inform a very ignorant man, which I profess myself to be, about all these things; what was this plan of the duke of Richmond's and Mr. Pitt’s
SMITH 10985 I understood equal representation in parliament, and that without it the people would not, asI understood the matter, have their rights. 
GARROW 10986 What did you take Mr. Pitt’s plan for a more equal representation to be 
SMITH 10987 For every man to have his voice. 
GARROW 10988 That you took to be Mr. Pitt’s plan
SMITH 10989  Yes. 
GARROW 10990 So much for the accuracy of your informa. 
GARROW 10991 tion, That gentleman read to you something about rights of man from the duke of Richmond’s plan; those were the only doctrines, of the rights of man, that ever you troubled yourselves with at Sheffield, were they; the duke has introduced an expression about the rights of man; did you read any other publications about the rights of man at Sheftield
SMITH 10992 Sometimes. 
GARROW 10993 You were a cutler 
SMITH 10994 Yes. Then of course, you had a cheap copy of 
GARROW 10995 Tom Paine’s Rights of Man, had not you
SMITH 10996 I have read Paine. 
GARROW 10997 That is not an answer; you know every cutler in Sheffield had one; you had a cheap copy, had you
SMITH 10998 I have seen one of the others, 
GARROW 10999 I dare say you have seen the best edition ; 
GARROW 11000 have you one of the cheap copies
SMITH 11001 I have seen both. 
GARROW 11002 I am sorry to be so troublesome, but I 
GARROW 11003 must have an answer
SMITH 11004 I appeal to the Court, whether I am to answer that. 
GARROW 11005 I do not ask you whether you read it to any human creature but yourself; do you happen to have one 
SMITH 11006 Yes; I have read one. 
GARROW 11007 A cheap copy; was it made a present of to you, or how did you get it
SMITH 11008 I obtained it by a subscription. 
GARROW 11009 A subscription of the society
SMITH 11010 No; my own, and a few friends. 
GARROW 11011 Upon your oath, to the amount of how many thousand of your townsmen were there, that had this cheap edition of the Rights of Man
SMITH 11012 I cannot tell that. 
GARROW 11013 0 you not believe that of the cutlers alone, in the town of Shefficld, who had the cheap edition of the Rights of Man, there were many thousand 
SMITH 11014 There were many. 
GARROW 11015 I take for granted, that you having read that book, considered it very much as a sensible, well-written book 
SMITH 11016 Yes; I thought well of it. 
GARROW 11017 Were you, or not, one of those who attended and passed resolutions, very properly approving of that book 
SMITH 11018 Sometimes I was there, sometimes not. 
GARROW 11019 You mean, at the society, where it was read for information and instruction
SMITH 11020 It seldom, or never, was read publicly at the society ; Ido not know that ever it was read in the society. 
GARROW 11021 Was it in the division meeting 
SMITH 11022 It was, when we met privately at our own houses; a few friends. 
GARROW 11023 When a few friends met for constitutional information, you then read that book 
SMITH 11024 Any thing. 
GARROW 11025 There werc ether cheap books furnished by the same subscription, were there not
SMITH 11026 Not many; there were a few. 
GARROW 11027 Could you help us to the titles of any of them
SMITH 11028 No. 
GARROW 11029 "Do you recollect the proceedings at the Globe-tavern, in this town
SMITH 11030 No. 
GARROW 11031 At Chalk Farm 
SMITH 11032 No. 
GARROW 11033 At the Crown and Anchor
SMITH 11034 I recollect seeing their names, never more than what was published in the public papers. 
GARROW 11035 I hope you had all Paine’s works 
SMITH 11036 No. 
GARROW 11037 ‘Were you present at the meeting, when a public resolution was passed, expressing aprobation of Paine’s works
SMITH 11038 I do not recolfect that I was at that meeting. 
GARROW 11039 You will not venture to swear you were not 
SMITH 11040 I was not, I believe. 
GARROW 11041 If you had been there, you would not have been dissentient
SMITH 11042 I cannot tell that. 
GARROW 11043 You told me, just now, you agreed in thinkang a valuable work 
SMITH 11044 I did. 
GARROW 11045 ‘hat do you take to be his notion, as to the use of monarchy in any state 
SMITH 11046 I never took that into consideration properly. 
GARROW 11047 Upon your oath, do you not understand his book, the Rights of Man, to be a specific for getting rid of kings every where, not only as useless, but as burthensome and destructive to the rights of man 
SMITH 11048 If he does, that is not my mind. 
EYRE 11049 You are not asked what you thought yourself, but whether Mr. Paine’s book did not propose it in that manner 
SMITH 11050 I believe it did, so far as I have read; hut I never took notice of that passage ; so far as I approve of it, I agrecd ; but I did not take it that Mr. Paine meant to destroy the king of this country. 
GARROW 11051 Upon your oath, did you not understand Paine’s works to be expressly written for the purpose of inculcating a notion, that monarchy was destructive to all civilized states, and that they could not too soon get rid of all kings
SMITH 11052 Though it was published that we had gained some knowledge by his works, that was never the intention of the society, nor did they take that part of his works, 
GARROW 11053 You did not understand it an approbation of his works
SMITH 11054 Only so far as concerned the House of Commons. 
GARROW 11055 Then I take for granted, you entered a protest against that part that touched the monarchy 
SMITH 11056 No. 
GARROW 11057 I will read you a little of it: “ All hereditary government is in its nature tyranny. Do you happen to know that the monarchy in this country constituted a part of an hereaes government
SMITH 11058 Yes, I understand it oes. 
GARROW 11059 And that Paine asserts tyranny to be interwoven in its very nature and existence 
SMITH 11060 Yes, I suppose he does. 
GARROW 11061 “An heritable crown— you are politician enough—I am sure a much better one than I am—to know that the crown of Great Britain is an heritable crown 
SMITH 11062 I believe it is, 
GARROW 11063 I take it for granted, that the throne ef Great Britain is, in your judgment, an heritable throne 
SMITH 11064 I suppose it is. 
GARROW 11065 Did you know that Paine says this: An heritable crown, or an heritable throne, or by what other fanciful name such things may bs called, have no other significant explanation, than that mankind are heritable property. To inherit a government is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds. This Passage was not expunged, I hope, in your cheap edition 
SMITH 11066 Our society never took that into consideration, 
GARROW 11067 Was that passage fairly printed im your copy 
SMITH 11068 I cannot say. 
GARROW 11069 Now, after the account you have given of yourself, and your manner of studying politics, Task you upon your oath, do you believe, that that passage was not in your copy
SMITH 11070 I cannot say. 
GARROW 11071 Then you have no memory of what he says about heritable crowns and heritable thrones
SMITH 11072 Not of that passage; we never took that into consideration. 
EYRE 11073 You are pot asked whether you approved of that, or took that into your consideration, but whether it was in the book 
SMITH 11074 I cannot say whether it was or was not; it might be. 
GARROW 11075 Was there any thing in Paine’s book that had for its object, to reconcile the people to the necessary expenses of their establishments and their government ; to make them contented under the weight of taxes that, to be sure, we must bear 
SMITH 11076 It was always advised for people to submit. 
GARROW 11077 Tam asking respecting this book, which you have studied accurately and attentively; did it strike you that there were any passages in it, tending to reconcile the people to the necessary burthens of the state
SMITH 11078 I do not know that there were. 
GARROW 11079 Were there none that struck you to have a contrary tendency, to excite the people to be dissatisfied and discontented, and to think their burthens were unnecessary? — We thought it was our duty to apply to parlisment for redress. 
GARROW 11080 That is no answer; tell me whether you recollect this passage, and I am now reading out of the cheap edition: “ It is inhuman to talk of a million sterling a year, paid out of the public taxes of any country, for the support of any individual, whilst thousands, who are forced to contribute thereto, are pining with want, and struggling with misery. you recollect such a passage as this
SMITH 11081 I believe I do. “ Monarchy would not have continued so many ages in the world, had it not been for the abuses it protects. It is the master fraud which shelters all others. Do you recollect this ?—Yes. 
GARROW 11082 You thought this a strong passage in f& vour of monarchy did you
SMITH 11083 That was never agitated. 
GARROW 11084 You read this passage 
SMITH 11085 Yes. 
GARROW 11086 And having read it, be so good as to tell me whether you consider that as a recommendation ofthe continuance of monarchy, orits immediate destruction—how do you understand the passage 
SMITH 11087 We understood that we might obtain some redress; we did notwish, In any way, to touch upon the laws ofthis country, by any means. 
GARROW 11088 T have already digelninned the intention to ask you any such question, because it is not fitto ask you whether you were a traitor, attend to my question—how did you understand the passage I have read to you, that“ monarchy would not have existed so many ages in the world, had it not been for the abuses it protects’? Did you understand that to be a recommendation, to the people of England, to protect and cultivate the monarchical principle, or to destroy it as soon as they could 
SMITH 11089 I can only answer for myself. 
GARROW 11090 ‘ow did you understand the author to be advising when you read that
SMITH 11091 I understood him to be expressing disattection to the king ; but then they were always put away, those things, and never adhered to, upon no consi-deration whatever, by any of us. 
GARROW 11092 Upon your oath, do not you understand thepassage, and did not you, when you read it, understand it to be a recommendation to get rid of monarchy as svon as you could 
SMITH 11093 We never intended to do so. 
GARROW 11094 Did not you understand the author so to advise 
SMITH 11095 Certainly ; the words are so. 
GARROW 11096 You understood that the object of a parliamentary reform was to be effected by petitioning, as that gentleman put it; if petitions of people in ditterent towns would not do, then there were to be petitions from delegates in aconvention. Did you expect your redress from parliament itself
SMITH 11097 Yes. 
GARROW 11098 Attend, then, to this passage in Mr. Paine's book, and tell me what you thought of that: —“ The bill, which the present Mr. Pitt brought into parliament, some years ago, to reform parliament, was on the same erroneous principle. The right of reform is in the nation, in its original character, and the constitutional method would be by a general convention, elected for the purpose, and so on. Now, having read this, as his account of a bill brought into parliamentto reform parliament ; and having stated that the nation itself, in its original character, was to do that, do you still adhere to it, that you expected it to be done by the House of Commons
SMITH 11099 Yes, and we thought that the proper place to petition. 
GARROW 11100 You stated to that gentleman, that you grounded yourselves upon the glorivus advantages we obtained by the Revolution in 1683 ; you, doubtless, have read with attention Mr. Paine’s account of these advantages
SMITH 11101 I have scen them, but I have not read them all. 
GARROW 11102 You have, no doubt, read such a thing as the Bill of Rights 
SMITH 11103 Yes. 
GARROW 11104 "Vhere is no cutler in Sheffield, but has read that, and attended to Paine’s account of itWe bave attended to the Bill of Rights, 
GARROW 11105 Does he, in giving his account of this, call that Bill of Rights, a Bill of Wrongs and Insults 
SMITH 11106 I never heard any body call it so. 
GARROW 11107 Do not you know Paine so treats it in his Rights of Man
SMITH 11108 Yes. 
GARROW 11109 observe you made use of this expression more than once, in your answers to the learned gentleman’s questions, that you ever heard the society, as a body, propose to teuch the dignity of the House of Lords, nor as body, propose to interfere at all with the monarchy
SMITH 11110 No. 
GARROW 11111 Did you know Mr. Yorke
SMITH 11112 Yes, I know him; I have seen him. 
GARROW 11113 And have heard him, perhaps 
SMITH 11114 Yes. ry private, and in public?—I have heard im. 
GARROW 11115 Did he use to attend at the mecting at Broomhead’s where the tribune was 
SMITH 11116 Sometimes. 
GARROW 11117 Were you a member of the secret committee 
SMITH 11118 No. 
GARROW 11119 Did you attend upon the Castle-bill when Yorke was there 
SMITH 11120 I was there some of the times. 
GARROW 11121 Am [right in supposing there was a motion made there for petitioning parliament 
SMITH 11122 I here was. 
GARROW 11123 What was the fate of that motion 
SMITH 11124 It was altered to petitioning the king. 
GARROW 11125 The motion for petitioning parliament was rejected, I believe 
SMITH 11126 Yes, it was. 
GARROW 11127 How many votes were there for pctitioning parliament 
SMITH 11128 I do not know. 
GARROW 11129 Upon your oath, was there a single hand but the hand of the mover and the seconder; I suppose all motions were seconded ? 
EYRE 11130 It was not seconded 
SMITH 11131 I cannot answer, there was such a concourse of people. 
EYRE 11132 How were the votes taker
SMITH 11133 By holding up of hands. 
EYRE 11134 Were you present upon the other hill, at Sheffield, at the celebration of the fast 
SMITH 11135 Y es. 
EYRE 11136 You were one of the congregation 
SMITH 11137 Yes, I was there. 
EYRE 11138 How many thousands of you might be there that day 
SMITH 11139 I cannot tell ; may be two thousand. 
EYRE 11140 You were one who joincd in all the ceremonies of that day 
SMITH 11141 I was there as a lookeron; that was all. 
EYRE 11142 When was it that your orderly and peaceable society, at Sheftield, first addressed the National Convention of France, as a national convention 
SMITH 11143 Never, to my knowledge. 
EYRE 11144 You never heard of'such a thing
SMITH 11145 I never did, 
EYRE 11146 You did not know that Sheffield had sent any address to France
SMITH 11147 No; I did not. 
EYRE 11148 Did you see the proceedings at the Castlehill, as printed afterwards with Mr. Yorke’s speech
SMITH 11149 I did; but never read them. 
EYRE 11150 They were pretty generally distributed at Sheffield 
SMITH 11151 They were to be bought at the shops. 
EYRE 11152 I suppose you were not in the secret, that the motion to petition parliament was mude on purpose to be negatived; were you acquainted, before it was made, that there was to be such a motion made, ia order to n me it
SMITH 11153 No ; I was not concerned in it at all. 
EYRE 11154 That petition to the king, you speak of, was for the abolition of the slave trade
SMITH 11155 Yes, accompanied with the other. 
EYRE 11156 And enumerating a long list of grievances
SMITH 11157  Yes. 
ERSKINE 11158 It was only a petition from the people at Sheffield, that was negatived, was it
SMITH 11159 No. 
ERSKINE 11160 I next propose to read this Jetter from his grace the duke of Richmond to colonel Sharman; it has been stated by one or two of the witnesses; but if it is thought more regular, I will call the duke himself; I believe his grace is in attendance. 
ERSKINE 11161  Mr. Erskine
SMITH 11162 We have troubled your grace to attend, in order to inform the Court whether this letter, which it has been proved in the course of the evidence, the people of Bhesiield all looked up to, as containing a . 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11163 I must object to this mode ; I shall be obliged to Mr. Erskine to ask his grace the duke of Richmond his question, without stating, by a preamble, why he asks it. 
EYRE 11164 You propose to call his grace, to ask him, whether this paper, now produced, is his letter to colonel Sharman; what has passed elsewhere with respect to it is nothing to the duke of Richmond. 
ERSKINE 11165 Please to look at this pamphlet
SMITH 11166 It is extremely difficult for me to say, whether the printed paper, that is this moment given to me, is precisely the letter I did write tu colonel Sharman, or not, because I know that there was a printed edition of that letter which was mutilated ; therefore, whether this is an exact copy, or not, I cannot pretend to say. 
ERSKINE 11167 Does your grace think, that by casting your eye over it, with attention, you should be able to answer that question 
SMITH 11168 I could. 
EYRE 11169 Then his grace may sit down, and cast his eye over it. 
EYRE 11170 Duke of Richmond
SMITH 11171 I think I can make the matter shorter, by putting into Mr. Erskine’s hand a copy of the original edition. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11172 The better, and the more regular way will be, that the letter shown to the Sheffield witness, and which, he says, contained the plan that they looked to should be read, and then it should be examined by somebody with that now produced by the duke of Richmond. 
EYRE 11173 But whether it be exactly a true copy of the duke’s letter or no, it is that which they state they- acted upon. 
ERSKINE 11174 Is this the Journal of the Lords House of Parliament of the year 1780? 
ERSKINE 11175 —It is. 
ERSKINE 11176 Mr. Erskine to the Duke of Richmond
SMITH 11177  Will your grace have the goodness to cast pour eye upon this Journal, of the 8th of Feruary, 1780? There is an entry that the Lords should be summoned to attend the 
ERSKINE 11178 House, for considering a motion for appointing a committee, and afterwards there follows a protest, signed. by your grace, and a great number of very illustrious peers of this country, among the rest I see the name of earl Camden.—Will your grace have the goodness to tell me if that is your signature to the protest 
SMITH 11179 It is. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11180 What is the evidence you propose to adduce? 
ERSKINE 11181 I will state the nature of this evidence which I offer 3 I will also state upon. what principle I conceive it to be evidence, unless the attorney general shall think it a more regular way for me to content myself with stating the nature of it, leaving to him, in the first instance, to frame his objection, and for me to answer it
SMITH 11182 This was a anotion, which came on in the House of Lords, recorded in the Journals of parliament ; there were petitions from a great number of associated bodies of men in this country, which associations were callin; emphatically and loudly upon the House on Commons to attend to its trust, for the House of Commons is,. itself, a delegated body, representing the people; calling upon the House of Commons to attend to its trust in consequence of that wasteful horrible expenditure which took place in the American war. 
BOWER 11183 You are stating certain facts wae do not appear upon the evidence you Offer. 
ERSKINE 11184 They do expressly. 
BOWER 11185 You state that, in fact, to be a proceeding in partewoent upon certain peUtions, which I say is not opening the evidence, unless you find it there. 
ERSKINE 11186 I do state that, and I mean to read it, 
EYRE 11187 I take it you are now going to open a motion in the House of Lords, which is upon the Journals. 
ERSKINE 11188 Just so. 
EYRE 11189 You may open the substance of that motion; and if you go beyond that, then their objection lies, that you have stated something which is not in the evidence. 
ERSKINE 11190 I.am much interested in avoiding objections, because I am hardly able to go through the common examination without that. ‘The noble lords in the protest, state their reasons for that Protest; and without reading this, which I have no rick to do, till your lortab! s shall be please! b receive it in evidence, I shall be in order, if! only state what I take to be the general sstance of it; and if I, in stating that, shou: step beyond what the aper itself should sf terwards show when admitted, then I am pesuaded I shall have given very just offence the Court. The noble lords, among wha are his grace the duke of Richmond the wit ness, lord Camden, and others, whose name are not material, upon the rejection of ths motion, protest, beeause they conceive it be the duty of the House to listen to the wil of the people; this is evidence to prom, that when these very numerous assoczel bodies presented their petitions, in cus quence of having had committees to co-op rate with one another, that the House caudered that, although it might be natn enough to reject the petitions of private sa et when the people were in large 2

ATTORNEYGENERAL 11192 I do not ko what it is Mr. Erskine is now alluding to; but if he will state to me that it is a proceeting of the House of Lords of this kingdoa, which he conceives can be of use to a subjed of this kingdom, standing at that bar, letit be what it will, if it be a proceeding of be House of Lords, I will not object to it 
ERSKINE 11193 I am much obliged to you I was sure that would come from you;sure your lordship, that Mr. Gibbs and I hare read it, and we do think it is material et dence. 
ERSKINE 11194 “ Die Martis, 8 Februarii, 1780. 
ERSKINE 11195 he order of the day being read, Tut all the Lords be summoned to attend the House this day, to consider of a motion far appointing a committee consisting of mem bers of both Houses, possessing neither ei ployment nor pension, to examlne without delay into the public expenditure, x mode of accounting for the same, more part cularly into the manner of making all om tracts; and at the same time to take into consideration what savings can be made cor sistent with public dignity, justice, and grt tude, by an abolition of old or new crested offices, or reversion of offices, the duties of whichhave either ceased, or stall a inquiry prove inadequate to the fees ; other emoluments arising therefrom, by the reduction of such salaries, or fe ailowances and pratt as may appeat vied unreasonable ; that the same may be app! to lessen the present ruinous y spent and to enable us to carry on the present war against the house of Bourbon, with that decision and vigour which can alone result from national zeal, confidence, and unanimity. t was moved, That a committee be appointed, consisting of membersof both Houses h Possessing neither employment nor pension, to examine without delay into the public expendi4 ture, and the mode of accounting for the same, more particularty into the manner of making all contracts; and, at the same time, to take into consideration what saving can be made, consistent with public dignity, justice, and graF titude, by an abolition cole and view ereaten 8 offices, the duties of which have either ceased 43 or shall on inquiry prove inadequate to the s fees or other emoluments arising therefrom, or by the reduction of such salaries or other ti allowances and profits as may appear to be 4 unreasonable: that the same may be applied & to lessen the present ruinous expenditure, t and to enable us to provide in the manner i the least burthensome for the indispensable y exigencies of the state. a“ Which being objected to, after long de; bate, the following amendment was proposed to be made to the said motion, viz. leave out the words members of both Houses, and instead thereof insert Lords. he same was agreed to and ordered ac- cordingly. hen the question was put, whether to agree to the said motion thus amended ? “ It was resolved in the negative. “Contents «.0s000050

ERSKINE 11200 “¢ Dissentient,—First, because however the waste of public money, and the profusion of useless salaries, may’ have been heretofore overlooked in the days of wealth and prosperity, the necessities of the present time can no longer endure the same system of corruption and prodigality. 
ERSKINE 11201 “¢ The scarcity of money, the diminished value of land, the sinking of rents, with the decline of trade, are melancholy proofs that we are almost arrived at the end of taxation ; and yet the demands are annually increased, while the hopes of peace are every year put to a greater distance. 
ERSKINE 11202 «¢ For let any man consider the immense debt, increasing beyond the possibility of payment, with the present accumulation of taxes upon every article, not only of luxury, but of cenvenience, and even of necessary use; and let him carry his thoughts forward to those additional duties which must immediately be imposed, to make good the interest of the approaching loan, and of that debt which wilt still remain unfunded, he will find that, at least one million and an half of interest must be provided for, besides what may be farther necessary, to make good the deficiencies of the late taxes. 
ERSKINE 11203 “ Under these circumstances, the savings’ of a strict and vigilant econumy in every branch, and the application of overgrown: salaries, unmerited pensions, and useless: places to the public service, are almost the only resources left in the exhausted state of our finances. But besides this strongargument of necessity that presses upon the present moment, such and so great are the abuses in the management and expenditure of the public money, as would call. for the strictest inquiry and animadversion even in the best of tumes. The practice of expending immense sums without consent of parliament under the fallacious head of contingencies and extraordinaries, the greater part of which might easily be comprised in an estimate, but because some unforeseen articles are not capable of such precision the minister has, under that colour, found out a method of expending the ublic money first, ad libitum, and when it as been so expended, has found means to’ induce parliament to think itself bound in honour to ratify and make it good, deserves the highest censure; and no minister who shall Gare to stake the public credit for money that las not been voted, ought to be justified by a less authority than an act ofindeme nity. The millions which remain in conseuence unexplained and unaccounted for— the shameful facility of admitting almost every claim —the improvident bargains made for the public service—the criminal neglect, and even contempt of the few checks established in the Board of Treasury, besides great part of the money being shared in its passage among a tribe of collectors, clerks, agents, jo bers, or contractors, or paid away by oficial extortion, or stopt in its course to breed interest for some engrossing individuals are grievances which the present motion has in view to remedy. 
ERSKINE 11204 “ Secondly, but great and important as the motion is in this view of it, it is still more important in another, as it tends to‘narrow the wide-spreading influence of the Crown, that’ has found its way into every corner of the kingdom. ‘ 
ERSKINE 11205 “It is sufficient to allude to this grievance without any farther enlargement; but this argument, though, perhaps, the strongest in favour of the motion, has been turned into an objection to it, as if it meant to abridge the’ rights of monarchy, and make the Crown de pendent upon the parliament, 
ERSKINE 11206 “If the objection means to insinuate, that’ 
ERSKINE 11207 corruption is necessary to government, we: shall feave that principle to confute itself by its own apparent iniquity. 
ERSKINE 11208 “ That this motion is intended to diminish theconstitutional power of the Crown, we deny; the constitutional power of the Crown we are no less sulicitous to preserve than we are to annihilate its unconstitutional influence. The prerogative, rightly uuderstood, nat touched, or intended to be touched by this motion, will support the Crown in all the splendour which the King’s personal dignity requires, and with all the authority and vigour necessary to give due effect to the executive powers of government. 
ERSKINE 11209 it has been argued, that this is not a proper time fur reformation, when all the attention of the kingdum should be employed upon the war, as the great and only object in the present time of distress; to which we beg eave to insist, that the present is, for that very reason, the properest time, because nothing is so essential to the conduct and proSecutiun of the war as the frugal management of that supply, by which only it can be carried on with any prospect of success; nor ought the plan of economy to be any longer delayed at the risk of a general bankruptcy ; and, trom the history of this as well as other countries, times of necessity have been always times of reform. 
ERSKINE 11210 hirdly, because we conceive that the mode of a committee, which might be to act with a committee of the other House, and might, if necessary, be rendered durable, and vested with due powers by an act of the whole legislature might bring back the public expenditure to its constitutional principle; might devise proper regulations for opening contracts to the proposals of every fair bidder, for reforming the abuses of office and the enormity of fees, with a variety of other abuses, particularly that of large sums of money lying in the hands of individuals, to the loss of the state. 
ERSKINE 11211 “ An objection has been strongly urged on the ground of an apprehension expressed by some lords, as if they seriously entertained it, of its producing a quarrel between the two houses of parliament, in consequence of which the public business might be obstructed, by a claim on the part of the House of Commons to an exclusive right of considering and providing for the subjects of this motion. 
ERSKINE 11212 “ Such aclaim certainly cannot be supported as a consequence of the claim of that House to originate money bills. Not a single lord Bpbeared to entertain an idea that such a claim would be well founded. In truth, the objection supposes it to be ill-founded, and that therefore this House will resist it, and yet it assumes that the House of Commons will advance and persist in this ill-founded claim, We cannot discover any colour for such a supposition, unless we were to adopt the insinuations of those who represent the corrupt influence (which it is our wish to supress) as already pervading that House. Those who entertain that opinion of one House of Parliament, will hardly think less disrespectfully of the other. To them it willsen a matter of indifference whether the moto is defeated by the exertion of that influence to excite a groundless claim in the one hous, or by a groundless apprehension of such s claim in the other. But we, who would be understood to think with more respect of both, cannot entertain an apprehension so injurious to the House of Commons, as that they would, at this time especially, and on this occasion, have advanced such a claim. 
ERSKINE 11213 “ The motion has likewise been objected to on account of its disqualifying persons posessing employments or pensions, to be of the proposed committee. We are far from supposing, that the possession of place pension, necessarily corrupts the itegnty of the possessor. We have seen, and th public have seen, many illustrious instances to the contrary; yet we cannot but sup pose that the public expectation of advantage from this measure would have beea less sanguine, if they had seen persoss possessing offices selected to distinguish how far their offices were useful, or their salaries adequate. ‘hey, perhaps, would not thisk the possessor of a pension, or office, the fittest judge how far that pension or office had been merited, or was necessary. We cannot there fore think the motion justly exceptionable on this ground; it rather appears to usb have been drawn with a proper attention to noble lords in that predicament, exempting them from a situation which they must necer sarily wish to decline. 
ERSKINE 11214 “We conceive ourselves warranted, in the mode poposed, by precedent as well as reasoa and it was stated to the House to have beea recommended by the most approved constitutional authors, who have written since the revolution; but having offered to meet any other proposition which might carry with it substantial remedy, and no such being offered notwithstanding the time this proposition has lain before the House, we cannot help consdering the present negative as going to the substantial as well as formal part of the mo tion, and hold ourselves obliged to avail ouselves of our right of entering our protest against the rejection of the above propositiot. 
ERSKINE 11215 “ Fourthly, we are farther impelled to press this motion, because the object of it has been seconded and called for by a considerable majority of the people, who are associating this purpose, and seem determined to pursue it by every legal and constitutional me that can be devised forits success ; and however some may affect to be alarmed, asif such associations tended to disturb the peace, & encroach upon the delegated power of the other House, we are persuaded it hasno otber view, but to collect the sense of the peo and to inform the whole body of the represe tatives what are the sentiments of the body of their constituents, in which respect their proceedings have been orderly, pes able, and constitutional ; and if it be asked 
ERSKINE 11216 ‘ what farther is to be done, if these petitions are rejected, the best answer is, that the case cannot be supposed ; for although, upon a few separate petitions, it may be fairly said, that the other House ought not to be decided by a part only of their constituents, yetit cannot be presumed they will act in defiance of the united wishes of the whole people, or indeed of any great and notorious majority. It is is admitied that they have a power to vote as they think fit; butit is not possible to conceive that so wise an assembly will ever be rash enough to reject such petitions, and by thatmeans cause this dangerous question to be broached and agitated, whether they have not broke their trust ? 
ERSKINE 11217 he voice of the people will certainly be complied with. Ministers may, as they seem to have done in a recent instance, deprive any man of what he holds at their pleasure, for presuming to exercise his undoubted right of thinking for himself, on these or other public subjects ; but it will not be wise in them totreat these associations with contempt, or call them by the invidious name of faction; a name by which the minority, in both Houses of Parliament, have been so frequently and so falsely calumniated, because the name, so applied, will recoil back upon themselves, when acting eee the general sense of the nation. Nor will they be able to represent these numbers, so respectable in rank and property, as they did but too successfully the discontented Americans, as a mob of indigent and seditious incendiaries, because the people to whom this is addressed, are the very people that are abused, and every man bears withi himself the testimony of its falsehood.

SMITH 11220 Dissentient without reasons, Radnor.—For all the above reasons except the fourth, Osborne. 
ERSKINE 11221 I call back this gentleman only for the purpose of asking him one question, which could not wit Propriety ask him before; you stated, in your former examination, your personal acquaintance with the prisoner at the bar, and your transactions with him before ; did you ever hear him state what his plan of reform was 
STUART 11222 Yes, I have; he always stated it to be the duke of Richmond’s plan, universal suffrage and annual parliaments. , 
ERSKINE 11223 Was that said to you publicly, or in the privacy of confidence 
STUART 11224 It was said publicly; and he sold me ‘some copies of the duke of Richmond’s letter. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11225 I really must object to this sort of examination, 
ERSKINE 11226 Then I will now defend this question ; I am persuaded your lordships will not refuse to the unfortunate man at the bar,, that evidence which has been received for, every prisoner under similar circumstances, from the earliest times of our history to the present moment. I am sorry to consume the, time of the court, but if I am called upon I will repeat to your lordships, verbatim, from the State Trials, various questions upon similar occasions, put by different fa by consent of all the judges, all the attorney generals, and solicitor generals, and counsel for the Crown. I only wish to know whether the, question is objected to or not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11227 Itis. 
ERSKINE 11228 I will proceed, and I have much more pleasure in doing it from the manner in which the attorney general conducted himself recently, because the moment that it was stated as a proceeding which, we thought, might be serviceable to the prisoner, and consistent with the rules of evidence, he. instantly acceded to its production—therefore, independent of satisfying your lordships, if I cun satisfy my learned friend that we are in the regular course, I am persuaded he would be sorry, himself, that this prisoner should be deprived of the advantage which all others have enjoyed. 
ERSKINE 11229 Ibelieve the reason why a matter of this sort falls into debate, is the very singular anomaly of the case before your lordships, and I am the more inclined to think thatI shall succeed in the little that I have to offer to you from what fell from the learned judges of the court of King’s-bench. (two of whom are now present) when it was discussed how fara. paper that had been published in the year 1780, which was supposed to have been written by some persons of rank, should have been. received in evidence by Mr. Justice Wilson, who tried an individual in the year 1793, fora libel
STUART 11230 The Court supported the rejection of it.—The learned judge rejected it upon this principle : That the defendant in that case was charged with an act, which act was the pula ofa libel; and that, although the late act of parliament directs, in fact, that the trial upon a libel, like the trial upon any other case, proceeds by the judge’s giving his opinion to the jury in matter of law, still it does not require that there should be any evidence upon the subject showing the intention of the prisoner. 
BULLER 11231 What prosecution do you allude to you? 
ERSKINE 11232 The case of Daniel Holt; and upon this ground, they say, you may rebut evidence fitch fastens any thing that is wrong upon you, undoubtedly, but because a rson has published a libel, supposing it to Pe one, in the year 1780, that will be no answer to your publishing a libelin the year 1793. It may be matter extremely material in mitigation of punishment, but, said the Court, it is not strictly evidence, because it does not go to negative the gist of the indictment; for nup aang itto have been received by the judge, he could not have told the jury, if he thought, in point of Jaw, the publication wasa libel, that the publication of the same libel by any other person, however respectable, at any other time, was a shield against the criminal laws attaching upon the defendant in that case; and upon that ground I do know that that most intelligent judge, whose loss we all in common deplore, decided it; and, as the court of King’s-bench determined, rightly decided it. 
ERSKINE 11233 Unless I deceive myself greatly, and unless T have lost the faculty of seeing whether Iam assented to, when laying down any proposition (which when man speaks to man 1s in general not very diflicult to see) I rather think am in possession of the opinion of the court in the striking difference between the case Now in agitation, and a case where a man is charged with a fact, which fact, if it be done, the criminal intention, which arises from the commission of the criminal act, carries with it acertain legal inference, which legal inference, being once established, it does not become a matter of fact for the prisoner to endeavour to rebut. 
ERSKINE 11234 But leaving out of the question all consideration of that act of parliament, I stand upon the authority of lord Mansfield, in the case of the king against Woodfall the printer, reported in sir James Burrow’s fifth volume: That wherever the fact does constitute the crime, but that the fact is either in itself wholly indifferent, or if it is not indifferent but criminal ; if it be criminal, short of the charge that is made upon the party, that there the intention is not matter of law, but that it is matter of fact, and that the party has a right to prove his intention in every way, by which the intention of a man can be safely, or reasonably collected
STUART 11235 To apply that doctrine in the case I have mentioned, which I am persuaded is familiar to all your lordships, in which a very elaborate judgment was delivered by lord Mansfield, where his lordship said, the defendant, Woodfall, was found by the jury guilty of having published the libel ; and though the defendant called no witnesses to rebut the criminal inference; yet, says lord Mansfield, if it be upon the libel, he may arrest the judgment upon the record, for the fact of publication is the crime that is imputed to him; and if, when it comes before the Court, that publication turnsout to be no libel, the defendant can have no judgment pr nounced upon him. 
ERSKINE 11236 Now, what is the present case 
STUART 11237 The Pr soner is charged with the overt acts, which I need not repeat, because we are so well a quainted with the nature of them; but he is not charged with the commission of thoe acts, as substantive acts, but he is charge with having in his mind the wicked and de testable purpose of aiming at the destruction of the king, to put down and bring the kiss to death, and that in the fulfilment of tut 
ERSKINE 11238 ‘most detestable imagination, he did the spec fic acts charged upon the record; that is say, that he agreed to assemble a conventia to be held which was not held—that he ca. spired to hold it, for the purpose of subse ting the rule and authority of the cousin, and not that alone, but that he consented te hold such convention, which convention, 2 his mind, was to accomplish the purpose of the subversion of the government, and thathe did agree to assemble that cunvention for the purpose of that subversion in fulfilment, nit that the other is the consequence of it, but fulfilment of the detestable purpose of compassing the king’s death. 
ERSKINE 11239 Here then the intention of the mind is tz question which the jury have to try; and think I may appeal to what passed in the Court on Saturday, that I did not seek to by down other rules of evidence than those thst have been most recently stated, and those tht have been determined in ancient times— Then, that being the case, let us see whelhet the declarations of a prisoner, charged with an evil and wicked intention—declarations 4 the time, or about the time—nay, I wil! 9 farther, since put to it generally, I sv! will prove (which is not this case by-the-bs, for my case does not require it) that if[, «40 am now speaking to your lordships, charged with the detestable purpose of com passing the king’s death, 1 should be intiti! to callany man in Court—not to my chr racter—but I should be intitled to call evey tan in Court who knows my sentimests, (which are well known upon these subjecs! what I have repeatedly declared with regard to the monarchy of this country, and its uulitt to the system of our government; but thot I should establish it clearly in twenty insta ces, or till your lordships desire me to farther, still it would not be so evident as It's in this case, that the intention of these pesons, and the object which they had in view was, to follow the plan of the duke of Richmond. — 
ERSKINE 11240 The first caseI will cite is the most mode, but not the least important, the case of k George Gordon, and I say it is the most 12 portant, because there he is not c with compassing the death of the king, but be charged with an act, with levying war; but stillit was necessary in the investigation of that question, since itis not that open rebellious war which every man must give the same name to, which nobody could explain away by evidence, but it being an ambiguous thing, a sort of constructive levying of war, the intention of his mind becomes the subject of consideration. I will read to your lordships the very words and syllables stated by lord Mansfield upon that occasion
STUART 11241 The question he puts to the jury is this : 
ERSKINE 11242 “First, whether this multitude did assemble and commit acts of violence, with intent to terrify and compel the legislature to repeal the act called sir George Savile’s? if upon this point your opinion should be in the negative, that makes an end of the whole, and the prisoner ought to be acquitted: but if your opinion should be, that the intent of this multitude, and the violence they committed, was to force a repeal, there arises a second point, whether the prisoner at the bar incited, encouraged, promoted, or assisted ,in raising this insurrection, and the terror they carried with them, with the intent of forcing a repeal of this law, If upon this point your opinion (speaking to the jury), should be in the negative, that makes an end of the whole, aod the prisoner must be acquitted: but if you think it was the intention of the multitude, and the violence they committed was to force a repeal, the second question arises whether the prisoner incited, promoted, or asSisted in raising this insurrection, with the intent,—not with the incitement to make a riot, and break my windows, or pull down any man’s house, which might have been felony under the riot act, if not dispersed, or might have been a misdemeanor according to the hatute of the violence committed
STUART 11243 but whether, to give it the substance of the cage, it was done with the intent of forcing a repeal of this law? upon these points, to which you, gentlemen, will call your attention, depends the fate of this trial. 
ERSKINE 11244 Then the first is a preliminary one, without which, says my lord Mansfield, my lord Gcorge Gordon must be scquitied ; but if you are of opinion that the multitude did commit the violence, which no man is disposed much to forget, whether lord George GordoninCited them to it? No—but whether he incited them with that mind which constituted the crime? 
ERSKINE 11245 Now I will read all the questions that he permitted to be asked upon that trial—The trial was conducted by men of the most acknowledged learning, one, indeed, whose learning, acuteness, and knowledge of the common law of England is almost proverbial, the late Mr. Wallace: the other gentleman, Mr. Mansficld, had long practised in the courts of common law, and they were by no Means disposed to give up any thing; they would have been drial ifthey had. There an opposite duty in every trial; there is a duty in those concerned for the crown, to a port the proper evidence for the crown; and2 similar duty also upon the counsel for the risoner, and he is as much criminal who relaxes the one as he who relaxes the other, though when it is in favour of a criminal it would not strike the mind so much; but I think that a crown lawyer has a right to insist upon every fair evidence coming before a jury, and to exclude every thing which may improperly operate. 
ERSKINE 11246 he counsel for lord George Gordon were the present lord Kenyon, lord chief justice of the King’s-bench, and myself, who have now the honour to speak to the Court; and I was permitted to ask the reverend Erasmus Middleton (the first witness, and therefore his examination fell to me as junior in the cause), these questions, I should tell your ships, to make it more intelligible, that the great object was, to see what intention lord George Gordon had, which could be collected only from what passed before; “ Did you, at any of these numerous meetings of this Protestant Association, which you attended from the time lord George Gordon became president of that society, (which was two years before) “ till the 29th of May; did you ever hear lord George Gordon, in his public speeches in that association, make use of apy expressions, which showed any disloyal, or unconstitutional intentions in him
STUART 11247 “ Not in the least; the very reverse in my opinion. —Now compare this with the question I am going to a a cunning artful man might stand up in a Protestant Association, and hold forth great professions when he mcant the contrary; but no man who reposes confidence in the bosom of a friend, building himself upon the honour and honesty of his friend, when he tells him what his object is, will deceive him. Good God! if I were to ask people, did not Mr. Hardy, in the Correspon
ERSKINE 11248 ‘ding Society, say that the duke of Richmond’s plan was his object? he might say it there for the purpose of its afterwards being given in evidence that he had poet saw that ; if that may be asked, how is it possible to oppose the other
STUART 11249 The examination goes on, “ Did all his speeches, delivered as president, meet with your approbation; and did it appear to you that his views were the same as those oft the whole associated body? —“ Quite so.—“ Did you ever hear lord George Gordan make use of aiW’ exprensige as ifhe meant to fo repeal this bill rce of arms?---“ Not in the least. Were the meetings open? and so on. 
ERSKINE 11250 Lord Kenyon then examined the present earl of Mansfield, at that time viscount Stormont, of every thing said by lord George Gordon, at St. James's, when he came to ask an audience of the king, and tendered his services to suppress the riots. He called after‘wards sir Philip Jennings Clerk, lord Lonsdale, and many other witnesses, to conversations with lord George Gordon both before and after, and to every part of his conduct and deportment upon that occasion
STUART 11251 It certainly was not debated, I think it the stronger for that, because when a cause of that immense magnitude is tried, where the whole capital was threatened with ruin, and when, as it has been said by the eloquent person we have heard of so much in the course of this trial that this town, and the whole country were in the utmost peril, I cannot suppose that those who represented government, were dis‘posed to treat lord George Gordon with more lenity than the rules of law entitled him to; ‘yet neither Mr. Mansfield, nor Mr. Wallace, the attorney and solicitor general, objected to that evidence ; I say nothing of myself, I was then a very young man in the profession, but the present chicf justice of England, who conducted that cause on the part of lord Gcorge Gordon was, and is, as weall know, a man of great learning, he put those questions without the smallest objection falling from Lord Mansfield, or Mr. Justice Buller who now hears me, or any other person. 
ERSKINE 11252 The next case I shall state is that of my lord Russell, who was indicted for compassing the king’s death, and the overt act was consulting to raise rebellion, and to seize the king’s guards. In his defence he called many persons of quality to speak to his affection towards the government, and his detestation of risings against it; I will pauseherea minute, 
ERSKINE 11253 ‘—why a man might have a great deal of affection to the government in the year 1780, and might change upon the subject, but yet the criminal law of England looks out industriously to see how it can interpose in favour of liberty and life, not trying how it can shut out the light, but how it can let it shine in; even that question, which I do not think one of the strictest, was suffered to be let in, because Dr. Burnet had had a long acquaintance with lord Russell, and lord Russell ight not have conceived the purposes of re‘bellion till a short time before; but I shall ask, as to the time when they say this man’s mind was full of this conspiracy, so horrible in its nature, what were the sentiments which he was pouring into the bosom of his friend, as the object of all these societies, “ Doctor Burnet, (says lord Russell) “ if you please to give some account of my conversation? Doctor Burnet says, “ I have had the honor to be known to my lord Russell several years, and he hath declared himself with much confidence to me, and he always, upon all occasions, ig gga himself against all risings. Now this is not character, to say that lord Russell was a quiet, peaceable man ; no, this is evidence of conversation, my lordtherefore it is not th you are to raise a probability upon the subject by the general nature ofa man’s character, «t what you think of him; but it shall be ali. ed to witnesses to say what the person tnin: has expressed, because it raises an intni improbability of his being golly of the crize imputed to him; doctor Burnet says, “x always expressed himself against all nsinzx: and when he spoke of some people that wa provoke to it, he expressed himself so dexmined against that matter, I think nom: could do more.—Does his saying this, x quit lord Russell of this rising; you heardi.2 say he was against all such risings as ares the subject of inquiry before you
STUART 11254 “ I bar him speak with indignation upon the subitl. —From thence the jury might inter ms quantum valere potest—I do not say it 8 conclude any thing ; I do not say that tht sort of evidence is at once to put an endt any cause, no man can be so foolish ab fancy that, but as far as it goes what is tole come of it after that evidence is heard, il & not for me but for your lordship and the fx: to decide ; the jury ultimately, but we shalt! be happy to hear your lordship’s obsersstea uponit; but the question is when it shall k heard, what impression it will make wy both. 
ERSKINE 11255 Doctor Cox was then asked thetions by lord Russell, and he says, “I bue heard him profess, solemnly, he thought it would ruin the best cause in the world toule any of these irregular ways for the presents of it. —Your lordships will give me leave pause again here.—This is not evena decintion of lord Russell, indicative of his gene! ideas, but upon the very point of trial; tu he, doctor Cox, had heard the prisoner & press his indignation and contempt for pre ceedings like those imputed to him—As! along, let me bring back to your lost consideration what it is I want to have a much more recent authority, the thority of one of your lordships, sixe cause began, What, shall a man not bed: lowed to explain his own meaning? If 1" ness had said, the defendant held a comes tion for the purpose of overturning iad vernment, still I should have thought Ibsright to examine the evidence, wheres att expression goes directly in the teeth of he has written; but where, as your ad has expressed upon another occasion, ial upon the surface a thing appears to be that the crime consists in the veil and corer’: of a wicked and detestable purpose, that om matter of fact merely—a matter oserious investigation, that your 1 take it as a matter that no mad, 0 life, between man and man, would throw his neighbour, but upon the most claw, satisfactory proof; ground that we have aright to raise up in the minds of the Court an intrinsic evidence, to operate as character does, for how is it that character is admitted against a fact
STUART 11256 I have heard a judge say here, if a fact is proved by ten witnesses distinctly, it is not possible to suppose that ten witnesses are perjured, who swear that I have stole a horse ; my character might create compassion with a jury, but could not do more, because there is much more probability that a man who has hitherto maintained a good character should stcal a horse, than that ten men should combine to destroy an innocent man when there is no reason to impute the crime to them; but when it remains matter of doubt, whenever the question is, What you have done ? and the consequent question is the quality of the act, and when your lordships are to fix the quality upon it, aud to consider, not whether it be the act, but whether it be the intention—suppose the jury should find that he had summoned a convention to do that which I know he did not, yet they must farther find that he did it in the language of the record, in the farther fulfilment ot his detestable purpose. 
ERSKINE 11257 Mr. Luton Gore, and doctor Fitzwilliams were examined to the same point;this trial was before lord chief justice Pemberton; sir Robert Sawyer, whose name I have had occasion to mention (who was nota gentleman fond of making very great concessions, I do not mean to say he ought, he was a most rigid man), was attorney general, the celebrated Mr. Finch was solicitor gencral, and upon that trial your lordship sees all these questions are put without any objection. 
ERSKINE 11258 The next case is that of Thomas Rosewellt who was a dissenting minister; he was indicted for preaching a treasonable sermon ; besides giving evidence directly denying the charge, fe called several of his conregation to prove that he generally kept the 30th of January as a fast, and frequently reached in favour of kingly government. Now only consider the difference of these two cases ; there the preaching the sermon was proved—lI have looked at the trial, because I saw this question brewing some days since, and therefore prepared myself for it, Rosewell was char with the publication of a libel in preaching this sermon; of a libel, for we all know that words cannot amount to high treason, but they may be so indecent as to be libellous, and may be of a treasonable nature, according to the subject. Then what was the evidence against the defendant? It was that A. B. C. D. heard him say the words; what is his answer to that? not at all what mine is, he wanted to raise up before the court and jury, a probability that the witnesses were either perjured or mistaken, because of the improbability that a man, who kept regularly the fast of the 30th of January, and who preached regularly in favour of the kingly government, should upon any one given occasion, such as imputed, have contradicted the general habits of his life, and Jibelled that government which he was accustomed to support ; but that is not my view in calling Mr. Stuart, for my learned friends have fixed no such object upon my client ; he has called a convention they say, and the say farther that he did it for a purpose, whic! I deny, and in fulfilment of another purpose, which I deny
STUART 11259 Am I not from these authorities to be allowed to produce the same sort of evidence in support of this poor shoe-maker, which the greatest men of the country have ever had an opportunity of doing without the smallest doubt? Mr. Rosewell says, “ Did you ever hear that I should say any thing ill ofthe king or government? Mr. Strong, “ No never. r. Rosewell asks Atkinson, another witness, ‘ That which I call you now for, sir, is to testify what you heard upon the Soth of January from me, about praying for the king and all that are in authority? Atkinson, “ my lord, he kept that day, the 30th of January, as a day of fasting and prayer, andhe preached from that text on the 1st Timothy 2,1. “ Pray for kings and all in authority. That was not the sermon for which he was indicted ; but in order to show that it was not probable he should have preached such a sermon as he was charged with, he shows that at a recent time he had preached diffe-rently; and certainly it is fair evidence; aman is not a republican on Monday, a moMarchy man on Tuesday, and a republican in on Wednesday, his sentiments do not 1 change inamoment. Mr. Atkinson proceeds in his evidence andsays, “ and then he did assert that kingly government was most agreeable to the word of God, and the constitution of the government of England.t My lords it is material that you should know who tried this cause, lord chief justice Jefferies tried this cause, and it is stated that he received the evidence; and Hume, the historian, remarked, such was the effect that had, that the jury of course com victed him, as they would every body else; that the chief justice did not even sum up the evidence, but contented himself with railing against conventicles. The next is Henry Curnish’s case; in 1 James 2nd, 1685, and when were these cases? at the very worst times in this country, whem judges were, what none of your lordships can, in the nature of things, be, men dependent upon the crown. Henry Cornish was indicted for compassing the king’s death; the overt act was conspiring with lord Russell and the duke of Monmouth to levy war; he called several witnesses to testify his loyalty, and though the witnesses were discouraged they were permitted to swear that they thought him loyal, and that he often dran! the King’s health. Lord chief justice Jones was the judge who tried the cause, sir Robert Sawyer was still attorney general, and Mr. Finch solicitor general. 
ERSKINE 11260 John Ashton was indicted, in 2 William and Mary, for a conspiracy to dethrone kin William, and compass his death ; the counse for the crown, in the opening, charged the prisoner with an intention to introduce popery ; in answer to which he gives evidence, which is to be found in the State Trialst of his zeal for the Protestant religion, and aversion to Popery. 
ERSKINE 11261 The crown say, that Mr. Hardy conspired to call this convention, which was to be assembled of delegates from some societies, of one of which he was secretary; which convention was to be assembled for the detestable purpose of subverting the government, deposing the king, and procuring his death; therefere I want to prove what was at that time the state of this man’s mind; what it was that he was constantly considering, erroneously, or otherwise; and upon this case it is not necessary for me to justify what the illustrious person, who is here present, has published ; whether it was wise, discreet, and egal in the duke of Richmond to publish that, I have nothing to do with; and if my client were charged with publishing that which is put into the hands of the witness, after what has been ruled in the King’s-bench 
ERSKINE 11262 I should not have offered it, because your lordships would have said that the publication of this as a libel, which constitutes that crime, would not be protected by the duke of Richmond having published the same libel at another time; or with your intention being only to publish that which the duke had set you the example to publish
STUART 11263 But when the uestion is what the intention of the mind of the man was? and when you have seen the duke’s plan,—I do not choose to affront a noble and honourable person, the pleasure of whose acquaintance I have long had,—the duke would have thought, and I should have thought, I had affronted him, if I had asked, did you, when you wrote this letter, mean thereby to depose the king, and to put him to death? He had no such intention, he could have none, his own interest is deeply involved in the safety of the state, he is himself of the same noble blood with the family now upon the throne. Then I wish to know if I may not be allowed, upon the authorities I have cited, to ask the witness this question? 
ERSKINE 11264 My lord, in the case I last stated, doctor Fitzwilliams, one of the witnesses examined upon this point, says, “ he, (that is the defendant) has always taken occasion, that I know several times, both at St. James’s and at Edinburgh, to testify his zeal against Popery. —The very charge upon the record being restore king James and bring in Pppery. The man's mind is proposed to be, and i consented by judges to be decyphered, oaleat quantum ‘valere potest, by his uniform declare tions of his detestation of those principles whicl the charge supposes him to have entertained. This trial was before that mos excellent judge lord chief justice Holt, and was conducted on the part of the crown ty serjeants Thompson and Tremain. 
ERSKINE 11265 The next is the case of sir John Freind, whose trial you have heard ef in the course of the cause, who was indicted for compassing the death of king William, and promoting an invasion and rebellion within the realm ; and in his defence he called many witnesses, ot to his character, for I take it that the meaning of witnesses to character is this,—for instame, put the case of a man who is charged wilb 4 crime of any particular description, suppose man charged with an unnatural crime, would it be any evidence at all to: that man’s character that he paid his bills regularly, ane that he was not a dishonest man, or a0y thing of that sort? No, your examination to character must always be analogous to the nature of the charge, and you would there inquire, whether he was a man of chastity, vou would inquire into his re; for women, into his morals, and into his conversation, so as it might rebuff any such horrible and detestable idea having passed in his mind, that he wasa man capable, in the ordinary course of his life, of efttertaining such opinions, and making use of such expressions; so if a man is indicted for any other offence, if a man is idicted for a robbery, I say I will show you that he was not a necessitous man, that he por sessed a large fortune at that time, that be was a man whose ideas were moral and ttally contrary to any such practice, that is the nature of character; but ] am not even ask ing that, I have been allowed to ask alreadr, and was not obstructed in it, as to Mr. Hardy's character for peace and quietness, but I am not asking that; butin the cases I have cited, that general character was permitted farther to be evidenced by that which it always mest produce, “¢ out of the fulness of the heart the mouth speaketh ; it does not always speak out of the fulness of the heart in public, ia private it ever does, but whether it does of not I am not inquiring into
STUART 11266 The jury may think after I have given the evidenee, thatit proves nothing, or little better than nothing; I hope they will not think so, but we are no" considering whether it shall be heard, nt what it amounts to when heard. 
ERSKINE 11267 In sir John Freind’s case, he says to the witnegs—“ When you have been in my com: pany, and they have been speaking of the government, what have I said or done? Is that any thing like character? Suppose at ! familiar case, this moment I should turn about to Mr. Stuart and say, when you have been speaking of government with Mr. Hardy, what has he gail or done? If my friend chooses to close the debate here, I will change my question to that, when you have been speaking with Mr. Hardy, upon the subject of the government of Great Britain, what has he said, or done? Why, says he, whenever I made use of any Teflecting words upon the subject, he was used to say forbear. The prisoner asks “ What -have you heard me speak of the French, and about any thing of an invasion? how I would ; 
ERSKINE 11268 venture my life for the Protestant religion or any thing of that
STUART 11269 A pretty handsome leading question too, but the minds of men are soothed and softened as they oughit to be, when a man, after the whole weight and artillery of the crown’s evidence has come against him, is standing up in the feebleness of innocence to make his defence. 
ERSKINE 11270 The attorney general will not, he cannot, think, after what I have said in the course of the cause, that I mean to insinuate any thing disrespectful to him, but only that this prisoner may have full measure, and not more than the full measure ; I think he has just as little right to have any more, as you have to refuse him that which he has. Mr. Lupton ays,“ TI have often heard you say, as to the Present government, that though you could Dot comply with it, you would live peaceably under it; when we have been talking of these things, you said you never would be ina plot. Now try that,—when I have been conversing with Mr. Hardy, he said he went upon the duke of Richmond’s plan, but he ever would be concerned in any plot against a government, never do any thing that was a conspiracy, but meant to limit his intention to any exertions to any given thing the witness will say, and whichIcertainly shall not put into his mouth. 
ERSKINE 11271 The next case is in 8 William 3rd, Peter Cvok’s case, who was indicted for the same treason of which sir John Freind was convicted, and the prisoner in his defence goes exactly to the same kind of evidence adduced i a the former trial. Mr. Serjeant Darnell, who was counsel for the prisoner, says, “ What have you heard the prisoncr say about our fleet or army? What has that to do with his character? it was to negative the probability of his wishing to bring to destruction our army and navy, and to bring in a foreign prince who had been expelled from this country for not recollecting what rights Belonged to the people of this country; he says, “I have heard him very much wish prosperity and success to our fleet. 
ERSKINE 11272 The next is the case of Dammaree, that familiar case which we hear of almost every day, in illustration of the principle of constructive levying war; he was a badge waterman to queen Anne; he was tried for pulling down a meeting house, and which Mr. Justice Foster says, “ was held to bea constructive levying of war, and which was not put as an overt act of compassing the king’s death. This is a very particular case, here is a man taken in the fact of pulling down a meeting house. Good God! I care not for his affection—if a man is taken in pulling down a mecting house, the law says he is guilty of high treason, for he absolutely does an act which, in construction of law, is a levying war against the king. A man may say I did not intend to levy war: a man comes with a hundred men, and is caught paling down my house, and says I did not intend to hurt you; here is an ambiguous thing, a thing which if it be said not to be ieeak is totally different from the charge in the indictment; and the office of my learned friend, who objects to my question, is to turn it round and to put a different construction ; to put the worst construction, instead of the best construction, upon this man's conduct, and I am seeking to prove that probability, by the same rules of evidence ever adopted, not in a case like this, where the intention constitutes the crime ; where it is voluntus pro facto, but in cases, even where it is factum pro toluntate ; I say when men assemble in teat numbers to pull down all meeting ouses; for though it would be difficult in the time ‘of Edward 3rd, to say that that ‘was what our ancestors meant by levying war, putting that aside, not to get into interlocutory debates in the middle of an argument, I say this is a peculiar and anomalous case, that its parallel is not to be found throughout the whole circle of the law, and for this wise reason, that his majesty’s life is so dear, his majesty’s life is so interwoven with the whole principle of the state ; his life, as chief magistrate, being that which if destroyed might bring on a convulsion in the country, which convulsion might deprive us of all that is dear to us, the law wisely makes the intention to destroy the king as guilty as the accomplishment, but then the intention is not any thing that you can argue into intention, but must be deduced from acts, which the jury must believe to have flowed from his mind and to have been the effect of that wicked and detestable purpose; why then, surely when that is the case, I have a right to ask whether the prisoner meant to pursue the duke of Richmond's plan? and leaving to your lordship and the jury to infer what I thought it would have been an insult to ask, whether, in merely following the plan of a person of illustrious birth, together with a great number of respectable persons some years ago, he meant to commit the crime imputed by this indictment? Surely it gues most strongly to negative that which constitutes the essence of this crime. 
ERSKINE 11273 Upon the examination of John Michaelmas, Mr. Whitaker, the counsel for Dammaree asked,“ was he disaffected to the queen and government? he says, “,I believe no man better affected. “At any times when there have been public rejoicings for any victories, how has he behaved himself? Now the first question is as to character, as aflected or disatfected, collecting it generally; but the second is to what has he said, how has he behaved at times of public rejoicings; when you have conversed with him, how has he declared himself; that is not a question to character. The difference between evidence to character, and this species of evidence, is this—as to character, what character has this person, and we have bcen very properly restrained ; Iconfess I have been irregular once or twice, and so has my friend, Mr. Gibbs, and your lordship has toid us of itin a very indulgent manner, for putting questions to character ina different way from what the practice is, You cannot, when asking to character, ask what has A. B.C. told you about this man’s character, no, but what is the general opinion concerning him. Character is the slow-spreading influence of opinion, arising from the deportment of a man in society ; as a man’s deportment, good or bad, necessarily produces one circle without another, and so extends itself till it unites in one gencral opinion; that general opinion is allowed to be given in evidence. But this case is totally foreign to that, as it is a declaration of the prisoner to an individual witness upon a particular occasion, and connected with the subjectjunder examiDation. 
ERSKINE 11274 I shall not trouble your lordship with many more cases, for if these are not sufficient, none can be. 
ERSKINE 11275 The next is the case of Francis Francia, who was indicted for high treason, in corresponding with the pretender. In his defence, Mr. Hungerford says to a witness, “ what do you know of the prisoner’s behaviour ?
STUART 11276 “ It was a great surprise to me when I heard that he was taken up, for he used often to drink a health to king George." 
ERSKINE 11277 In Fitzharris’s case, he asks a witness whether he thinks the act with which he is charged, was done with a treasonable intention—that is not objected to, though Jefferies conducted that cause. 
ERSKINE 11278 Then supposing these authorities to be out of the question, and supposing that these which Thave troubled your lordship with had not existed, but that I was obliged to do that which it is my privilege to do, to stand upon the principles of the criminal law of Enza, which are full well known to your lordshiy, without being obliged to look up to othe sources, Your lordships all of you have long presided in courts of justice, and I am sm those of your lordships particularly, vb preside in criminal courts of justice, having great expericnce, must think that when te nature of this case is considered, when its anomaly is attended to, when it is recollectel that although the statute of 25 Edward sx, certainly docs not make the overt-act charged upon the record treason, yet when the overt act is admitted to be charged upon the record, every thing which creates a probability to te contrary, to negative the intention, mustle received, provided it be a rational principle a evidence, provided it be of a sort that wha one looks round it, one sees nothing by wld justice may be surprised and endaugered; fa I should be extremely sorry to press in the most criminal case, however agitated or ear est I might be upon the subject, for sy thing which had not been indulged to others in a similar course of proceedings. I wish much as any subject of the country cao wish, that the law of the land should be admins tered tairly and impartially ; that one mz should have what another has had, but more, and no less; and I conceive that whes my friend, the attorney general, takes the into his consideration, that he will think the cases I have cited, and the principle on whieh they are grounded, entitle me to have this evidence almitied, I would not have troubled your lordships with the cases, but I considered it as a matter of importance, not only ssi concerned the administration of justice 10 ge neral, but as it concerns the case of the ptr soner before you. 
GIBBS 11279 I submit to your ar og that this evidence is admissible. My leame friend has exhausted all the law that an out of the ‘case, and therefore it will not be necessary for me to trouble your lordsbups upon that part of the case; but it seems to me upon a plain principle in a case of sort, the declaration of the prisoner explaizing the overt-act, the tendency of which over act is the point for the jury to determine toust be admissible evidence. 
GIBBS 11280 Your lordships will find it is laid down 0 lord Hale—I believe it is laid down io muy cases, that an overt-act, indifferent is 4 nature, may yet be explained to be an ovettact committed, tending to the purpose cor ceived by the prisoner of destroying the king; for instance, theact ch upon Crobagal, the coming into England was in itself a0 different act, which became an overt-act compassing the king's death, because te intent of bis coming into England was & plained by words spoken elsewhere; ands many other cases I take it that words spoken by a man, not only at the time of the overt act, but before that time, are admissible, for tere is no limitation of time within which words spoken by a prisoner may not be given in eidence to explain the nature of an overt act, charged to be an overt act in the prosecution of his design of compassing the king's death 
GIBBS 11281 Now if the crown may give evidence of the whole of a man's life, for the purpse of explaining an indifferent act, and giving it a crimial complexion, surely it follows, upon the principle of administering equal justice, that whatever he has said upon the same subject, tending to prove a differnt intention, an innocent intention, it should be copetent to him to give in evidence. I take the distinction to be this: if that which is charged upon a man to be an act, if it be a thing done, you cannot in any case give in evidence that the prisoner has denied that he did the thing. The crown in that case may give evidence, that the prisoner did at any time admit that he committed the act, that he did the thing, the prisoner cannot answer that, by showing that at another time he said he had not done it, though you may ask whether he had not held some other conversation which explained 
GIBBS 11282 ; the tendency of that. We have it not in question now, whether he did commit the overt-act stated in theindictment, but whether 
GIBBS 11283 In committing the act, he had, or not, the original design 
EYRE 11284 Here the design is part of the overt-act; it is described as part of the overt-act. 
GIBBS 11285 The design is a part of the overt-act in this way—the overt-act of comthe calling together a convention for the purpose of deposing the king; it states first the treason ; the treason laid is that he compassed the king’s death, and then the overt-act is laid thus—that he, with others, for the purpose of accomplishing the treason, did conspire with others to call this convention, in order that this convention might depose the king. 
GIBBS 11286 The distinction that I was taking is this— I know that we have before the jury both the fact and the design as to deposing the king; namely, the fact of consenting to hold a convention, and the design with which it was consented to be held; but we are now about to show what the design was, to exculpate the prisoner trom any criminal intention. I admit we could not go into evidence of what the prisoner had said at any time of his life, for the purpose of showing he had not consented to hoid this convention, because that is a fact ; butIsubmit with great deference to your lordship, that in order to show that that convention was consented to be held, not with the design which the crown imputes, but with an mrocent design, we may go into evidence of what the prisoner has at other times declared, inasmuch as the crown has gone into ull that which the prisoner at apy part of his life has declared touching this fact; and not only that, butinto evidence of what any member in the London Corresponding Society, any member of the Constitutional Society, or an member of any societies corresponding with those societies have said. As the crown is permitted to go into evidence of what any one of those people have said, in order to prove that the ultimate design was to depose the king, we only ask in answer to that, that we may be permitted to go into declarations of the prisoner of that which can be only found in his own mind; not that he did not do the act imputed to him, but that the design with which he did that act, was different from that which the crown imputes. I was going to put a case which I had forgot in the course of the argument, which appears to me not unlike this, and which was suggested by your lordship’s saying that the design of deposing the king is a part of the overt act—the case of murder; suppose it plainly proved that the prisoner did kill the deceased, and the question is whether it is murder or manslaughter, that will turn upon the intent. I take it in that case it is the constant, uniform practice to receive evidence ef the declarations of the prisoner of his -will and friendship to the deceased. —Now, why are these declarations received ; Iam sure I have heard, in innumerable instances, evidence given of declarations of prisoners of good-will to the deceased, when they have admitted they gave the fatal blow, and when the question is, what is the quality of the act committed, whether murder or manslaughter ; and the rule, I take it, is not confined to declarations immediately upon committing the act, but to declarations at former times. Why are these declarations received; the act of giving the blow is admitted. So here the calling a convention is admitted, the declarations are received for this purpose, to show what the mind of the man was, what his intent must have been, whether he gave the blow with a view to produce death or not. Then with what view do we offer this evidence? to show his design, whether it was the design the attorney general imputes, or an innocent one. We offer this evidence in order to show that the object of this convention was different from that which the attorney general states, in the same way as the evidence of good-will to the deceased is admitted, in a case where the question is, whether the crime is murder or manslaughter. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11287 I rise in the first place to state to your lordships the objection which I have to the question that was addressed by my learned friend to the witness. 1 hoped that this objection had followed so immediately upon a conduct that I am persuaded betrayed, on my part, no wish to shut out any evidence that appeared to me to be admissible, that my learned friend would sincerely have given me credit, as he now states he does, for making this objection upon a ublic principle. I beg to say again, what I ; Lies had occasion to say befure in the course of this trial, that it belongs to every man in acourt of justice, as it dues to every man elsewhere, to be liable to error; it 1s not, therefore, with any confidence that I must be right, in the objection which I take, that I presume to trouble your lordships with this objection, but it is in consequence of an opinion that I am right; and if that be my serious opinion, recollecting that I stand here as prosecutor for the public, I am not at liberty, whatever my inclination might be, to sacrifice what appears to my own mind to be a great principle in judicature, adopted and acted upon for the benefit of the public, and, therefore, for the benefit of every individual who forms a part of it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11288 When my learned friend stated that he had scen this objection brewing for some days, he will allow me to state to him what I do state upon my personal honour, if it be necessary for me to pledge that to him, that so far from brewing this objection, I do state, that I do not look forward enough into cases to anticipate such objections, for I protest I had not foreseen that such evidence as this would be offered, and had not considered it. But the learned and able manner in which my friend has reasoned upon it, I think of itself is some degree of testimony in support of what I am now saying, that it is an objection which, at least, had colour enough in it to invite the minds of two able counsel to apply their abilities to repel the objection, if it should be taken, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11289 Having stated thus much—what your lordbell has heard with respect to the case of Holt, and an expression which has fallen from my learned friend in discussing this objection I hope will prevent its appearing to those to whom I am now addressing myself, improper to make this observation upon it. When a motion was made for a new trial, because Mr. Justice Wilson was supposed to have rejected evidence which he ought to have admitted, my learned friend, in the discharge of the duty which he owed to his client, contended as strongly that that evidence was admissible, as day that this evidence is admissible; and I am perfectly persuaded that if any man had Jeft the court after he had heard my friend, he would have gone out of court with an opinion, which I hope my friend will not be too incautiously industrious in propagating, that there was a difference in the law of evidence, as it affected a newspaper printer at Newark, and as it affected other persons whose paper he proposed should be received in evidence. My lord, I say incautiously do it—and I think it my duty to say it, because when in the course of a trial affecting the life of the person who now stands at this bar, and not only affecting his life, but affecting the interest which every man in this country has in his e has done this us) 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11290 own life, and affecting every interest that aa be dear to him, I wish my learned nec would at once either decline talking of tk difference between a poor shoe-maker ai men of higher rank, or that he would su the facts upon which he thinks it fit to bed that sort of language. My lord, we livea a country in which the providence of the law, like the midenee ? God, is rer hs high and low, rich and poor; and speakny ior myself, I desire to be disgraced from ts moment, if in the course of this trial, either have conducted myself, or can conduct mrs in such a manner as not to do that justice & this prisoner which the law means should te done to him. 1 think I should be worthy oi that death, and ten such deaths as the pn soner must suffer, provided he is found guir upon this trial. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11291 Having said thus much, I proceed to su to your lordships that undoubtedly I ast that the questions with respect to the eft of evidence, and the admissibility of evidence, are perfectly distinct : for instance, if in te case of any person you find him at a tavert, speaking respectfully of the hereditary bility of the country, and of his majesty, 3 the situation and character which he holdst this country; and you find, on the olx hand, papers in which he holds perlecty different language upon other occasions; fact whether he held that conversation at ts! tavern or not, may or not be evidence ing to the circumstances under which th! conversation is held. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11292 In the case now before the Court, your lortships will recollect that it has been given 2 evidence that Mr. Tooke (one of the pers! whose name occurs in this indictment) at the Crown and Anchor, upon the 2nd of May, 1792, spoke with great respect of the hereditay nobility of the country, and spokealsowith rpectof the majesty of theking. Whyisthaterdence? clearly for this reason (without exam ing whether it would be evidence forany ob reason) namely, that it was a transactionof be two societies met in the course of the buss which they had been doing ; and it came ot also upon the cross-examination, which 6 another circumstance that will require 0 materially attended to. So with respect the prisoner at the bar—if, for instance, has been evidence given of the effect of ers, that the language which he ws fold was to be such language as pi would permit; — that be received psy which were not communicated to the sodely: and one private letter, in which a propos is stated, that monarchy is to be ripped UP by the roots; that in the answer to that it stated to those who held that conversst with him about monarchy—do not talk monarchy—do not talk about demo] —let your language be confined vod versal suffrage and annual parliaments all the rest of your objects will erg’ say there may be a great number of circumstances given in evidence, but then the question will follow, whether the decla‘ ration the man held is given under such circumstances at such time, and in the course of a conversation which makes that declaration evidence. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11293 Now with respect to lord George Gordon’s ease, if I recollect rightly, the principle upon which the declarations were received in evidence was this—that in that case the declarations were really a fact, for whatever declaration accompanies the transaction, whatever declaration is a part of the transaction that is done, is part of the fact that is doing, and upon that ground the declarations were admitted; it does not weaken the observation at all, that evidence was given in ’ that case, that lord George Gordon went to some magistrate, or some other person, whilst the mob was over-ruling tbe civil power of the country, for any conversation that was held by lord George Gordon duringthe existence of these riots, and with reference to them, he being a party in them, was t a declaration made at the time, and upon all the principles of evidence, was, therefore, connected with the transaction. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11294 With respect to the case stated last by my learned friend—Crohagan’s case, I take that to be as distinguishable from the present evidence upon the same principle, the object was to prove the view with which the man came into England ; he declared that he would Gome into England to kill the king; he did eome into England. Your lordship knows that hismaking the declaration, thoughit would be pimizhable in another way, yet still would not e high treason, if he had not come into England ; and, upon the whole of the evidence, the coming into England made a part of the transaction with the declaration he had made, it was an overt act of high treason, because it was then understood to be a fact done with the intention which the indictment imputed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11295 My learned friend has said respecting Rosewell’s sermon, that no sermon can be high treason, I will not argue that, but I submit it is very dangerous to state that no sermion can be high treason. 
ERSKINE 11296 I said no sermon could be high treason, without being in pursuance of some plan. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11297 It is matter of good fortune then that I have stated it. No man in the world will suppose that I mean any thing else than what I am now saying ; —lIt does happen in the course of what counscl are stating, that they may conceive themselves to say what did not fall from them. 
ERSKINE 11298 I appeal to every body round me, and the whole public that I did
STUART 11299 I apal particularly to the whole bar. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11300 Then I can only say for myself what I am about to say for my learned friend, that it happens to those whose attention is called to the discussion of subjects, that words now and then which really fall from gentlemen do not strike the ear of those to Eon they are addressed, who ought to hear them; meaning at the same time to say distinctly that I did not hear them, but it is satisfaction sufficient to me that my friend permits they should be ut in. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11301 What is the evidence in the case of Rosewell, and many others to which my friend has alluded? In the first place he has not stated with respect to these trials who were the witnesses that were allowed to speak to these facts; he has not stated whether these circumstances were asked upon cross-examination; he has not stated whether witnesses were called to general character, and then gave in evidence these circumstances, in explanation of the general character which they had given; he has not stated whether the witnesses who spoke to these particular. declarations were speaking to declarations which did or did not pass in the course of the. very transaction which these witnesses were called to prove. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11302 Iam not meaning to contend in this case, that it may not be competent for my friend to state every word that Mr. Hardy ever said in the Corresponding Society—every word that Mr. Hardy said in his correspondence with every ater society; every word that he ever said in the Constitutional Society; every word which it can be shown upon the evidence proposed had a direct connexion, or which can be properly or fairly connected with the transaction now before the Court; but what I object to is this—that you should call a witness who was not a member of any of these societies, a witness who has already told the Court that he did know but little of Mr. Hardy, that he did not even know he was an associated member of that society, any connexion with which the Friends of the People had disavowed, and that you should be permitted to ask that witness, not this question, whether in the course of any transaction connected -with the subject now before the Court, Mr. Hardy made a declaration that could be considered asa part of that transaction, but that you should ask that witness what were the declarations of Mr. Hardy at any time, when he may have scen him without connexion with the subject which is the matter of the present indictment; this will lead a great way; it is not worth while to argue upon the effect of it, for that will go another way; but I wish my learned friends to consider a little if this evidence is let in for a prisoner, it will possibly lead to let in evidence against a prisoner. I am persuaded Ido not do injustice when I say that there may be cases, I will say nothing about the present case, because I ought not; but there may be cases in which, if this sort of evidence can be let in upon principle, it may furnish a principle upon which I may be obliged to offer that evidence which, according to my present opinions about evidence, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11303 I have not thought myself at liberty to offer in this cause. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11304 I shall trouble your lordships for the purpose of stating the extent to which this principle may go; and your lordships cannot but be aware how extremely important it is to attend to the manner in which questions of this sort have been permitted to pass upon trials. They are often not attended to, they are often thought unimportant upon particular trials, and therefore not objected to; nothing can show that in a more striking light than the question which Mr. Erskine stated to have been put in Fitzharris’s case, “ whether the witness thought the act with which he was charged, was done with a treasonable intent,—which was the very question to be left to the jury. Now that question having been put withoutany objection to it, shows that in the course of trials of this nature, things are frequently passed over without objection which ought to be objected to, especially on the part of the crown, to whom itis constantly attributed, in all trials of this nature, that they are pressing the prisoner too far; that sort of odium being constantly attempted to be thrown upon every crown prosecution ; those who are employed by the crown are always extremely anxious not to raise objections, where they do not think that the general necessity of public justice requires that they should be raised. Now the objection here I believe, is raised simply upon the grounds of the general necessity of public justice; at least, as for myself, and with that view which I have conceived of the subject, I have been so far from objecting to questions being put, that I have sat silent till now during almost the whole of this trial; but it strikes me that the rules and principles of law, and especially the law of evidence in criminal matters, ought to be attended to with a very considerable degree of care and caution, for unless they are attended to, it is impossible to say to what length, upon the authority of what has passed in particular cases the matter may not be carried. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11305 I have conceived that a question which went to a particular fact, not relative to the charge of the very fact which was in mii never could in its nature be asked with a view to ny the truth of the particular charge; general character may be given in evidence, general conduct may be given in evidence, conduct being in effect part of character, but I never did conceive, that in any case whatever, if a man was trying for any act whatever, that you could give in evidence any particular acts that he had done at any particular time, under similar circumstances, and the question which is now attempted to be put, appears to me tobe of thatnature ; if this question can be put, why may not the prisoner at the bar, give In evidence every letter such he has ever written to any person whatever, upon litical subjects, in which he may have stated 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11306 ‘his own objects in any way in which bthought proper, and, perlvaps, with avs to this very prosecution; it strikes me, thi: this is considered, the danger of the adasion of such evidence is considerable, ai that it is contrary to all the principles uv which Courts have proceeded. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11307 If your lordships advert to the cases cts! by Mr. Erskine, and see the manner in wie he has stated them, I think your lonshy will find that, except as far as inadvertesi may have permitted questions to pass u noticed, they do not press very hard upon tt: case. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11308 With respect to the case of lord Ger Gordon, I have looked into it; having ue trial before me, it does not appear to meta! any one question was put with respect tott words of lord George Gordon at any tut, 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11309 1 which did not, in effect, form part of bisaduct in the very transaction which wa t question. Like the cry of a mob, for stance, in pulling down a house, the gener cry of a mob is given in evidence against it prisoner, because it was a part of the trusxtion at the time. es 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11310 With respect to the other cases, I think will be found that the questions have ral been upon the cross-examination of thness, and not upon any original exsminata on the part of the prisoner himself, for it purpose of showing by what he did at a time, what was probably his intention damanother thing at another time. 
ERSKINE 11311 I hope you will not be offended at me for this interruption whetmay amend your last observation : They all of them taken from the State Trials, asd they are all spon original examinations 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11312 I will then slitle advert to some of them: in Cornishsax , what wasit? He called several witness testify his loyalty, and that he drank tk King’s health ; does that warrant the questa which the learned counsel was going to pul Mr. Stuart with respect to Mr. bi a cular object in a particular thing? For thas the nature of the question hre was goingtop So in sir John Freind’s case, what are the questions that were put? When you hae been present in company, and they bave beet speaking upon the subject of goveramest what has he said or done? Why he us say, “ forbear, I do not admit of apy discourse ; that is evidence of his gem conduct with respect to the goveroment ol te country, and with respect to his veiw intentions as to that government; Mr. ton, I think, says, although you would a8 comply with what was proposed to yu, i you said you would never be concerned in plot. Now I think that that expression ma! have been upon a cross-examination, by 3 person who was called to give evidence plot
STUART 11313 I cannot unders' it unlessa749 so. And what was the fact im si: Freind’s case? Why the fact. was, that ita 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11314  . derstand it. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11315 dn which yoy have thought proper to conknowledge of law; I am not used to mayself, but I will not be taught by you or any be'concerned jn any such plot as was charged. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11316 proved, as clear as day-light, that he was concerned in a plot. And what a way this is of trying the guilt of 3 person, with respect to 9 particular fact, by bringing persons tg say, at at a particulay time he said he woujd no 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11317 Would ‘it be permitted upon a trial for murder, for instance, to give in evidence, that the prisoner said he would not commit a gnurder ; and yet as far as I have any conception of this, as stated by my Jearned friend, it was simply that evidence; and thereforeIthink it must have been upon a cross-examination. 
ERSKINE 11318 I tell you it was not. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11319 Then I do not understand. 
ERSKINE 11320 I see you do not. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11321 The manner, sir, in which you have thought proper to conduct yourself towards me, in the course of this trial has been such as reflects upon my character. I wil not submit to any map for talk of other person, propriety of conduct either ina civil or criminal case; I believe, I know myduty in both as well as you do; and I trust that I shall discharge it. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11322 y lords, the next that was mentioned was there? In order to show his general affection to government, it was asked, how has he behave at any general rejoicings? Is that any thing more than evidence of general deportment? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11323 ‘With respect to Rosewell’s case, itseems to me that that is in a great degree general deRest alhouph Y 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11324 that there was a degree of inaccuracy jn permitting the question to be put exactly as it was put ; but the question really tended simply to this, whether his general deportment was that of aman who was loyal and: attached to the government of the country? and nothing more. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11325 As for what my learned friend said with Yespect to a sermon being, or nat, treason; I think there wasa sermon which is mentioned in the history of our country, I mean the sermon preached by Dr. Shaw, at St. Paul’s Cross, for the purpose of exciting the people to 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11326 ‘rise against Edward the fifth, and put Richard 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11327 ‘the third upon the throne, which wasas clear an overt act of high treason as ever was committed. 1 mention this, because certainly the words which my learned friend has said he made usc of, did escape my ear, as well as the attorney general’s ; and, which shows that they did escape my ear, I do assure him that I have taken down, in the margin of my brief, that vey case of Dr. Shaw, which I then recollected, and that I could not have taken it down if I had conceived he had made use of the words which he says he made use of, and which I have no doubt he did, : 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11328 in that office, which my learned friend near me now holds, may not when it is produced as an authority against them, have it said that Mpon this trial (and a solemn one trust it will be) such and such things were admitted to be given jn evidence, and that therefore these reasons it 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11329 J must confess, that it} ikewise was a case in which I should think Under these circumstances, from the necessity that there is that in such a case as this a rule should be laid down which can be properly pursued—A rule which men may understand, and, calling upon your lordships attention that we objected sporting the prisoner’s general conduct; also to no questions releclaring that, for myself, in the view which ] 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11330 have of the case, I would rather have the question asked than not, yet for the sake of generyl justice, for the sake of what is to be one in future trials, and that other persons such evidence ought always to be given; for joes seem to me Important, that your lordships should lay down some rule upon the subject. 
BOWER 11331 Notwithstanding we are now not only in a criminal case, but ina case which affects the life of the prisoner at the bar, I make no apology at all for troublin our Lordships with the few observations have to offer, because I not only am conscious that neither myself, nor any one gentleman, with whom I am associated in this prosecution, can possibly conceive the purpose of pressing any evidence against the prisoner which we do not think is competent evidence, but I am confident that there does not exist acreature, about whose opinion I am anxious, that can conceive such a purpose to enter into the heart of any of us. 
BOWER 11332 My lords I conceive that this case, capital as itis, is to be tried upon the same principles of evidence as all other cases are; and it is our duty, as counsel for the prosecution, to resist the admission of any evidence which we think not competently legal, as much asif we were trying a common action of assault and battery, or as if a question could arise upon any subject that could possibly be -debated in acourt of justice, which imagination could conceive to be the most trifling. 
BOWER 11333 ‘Ihave always understood, that the declarations of parties are evidence only either in cases where they accompany the act at the time that they are made, or where they have been made at different times, and under different circumstances, totally unconnected with that fact, which is the question under discussion in the Court, in which cases they have always been received in the nature of facts, or rather as circumstances by which the general conduct of the party is to be judged of, as being circumstances, and being declarations given upon subjects to answer no particular purpose, and not connected with that which is the subject matter of discussion at the time that the evidence is given. 
BOWER 11334 Every case my friend, Mr. Erskine, bas cited, in my opinion, confirms the principle I am now stating; andif your lordship will examine them, one by one, you will find that in every case, which he has stated, where evidence of this kind has been received, it has been to show the general conduct and character of the prisoner, in circumstances and upon occasions no way connected with the crime of which he was then accused, but as circumstances and declarations in situations from which the jury might collect the general character and conduct oF the prisoner. 
BOWER 11335 It is indisputably true, that in the case of murder, evidence has always been received that the prisoner has at other times, upon other occasions, and in different circumstances shown acts of kindness to the deceased, and expressed himself kindly towards him, and they are offercd to show that that was the general disposition of the prisoner towards the deceased, from which the jury may collect that it could not be his intention to commit the crime which was imputed to him; but did any man alive ever hear it asked of a witness, produced in a case of that kind, whether he had heard the prisoner say, that he had No intention to kill the deceased ; and that that should be received as evidence, to explain the acts which were proved against the prisoner, upon the evidence given; and upon which the judgment of the Court and jury are to be drawn? 
BOWER 11336 In Holt’s case, which my learned friend has cited, in which he has admitted that the judgment of the Court of King’s-bench, went slong with the opinion of a learned, and most worthy judge, deceased—it appears that the judges were unanimous in thinking, when the fact was proved that the libel was published, that it was not competent to the defendant to explain his conduct, to state how, or in imitation of whom it was, that he had done that act which was then attributed to him as a crime. 
BOWER 11337 Inlord George Gordon’s case, the declarations there received, come under the other Principle, they were properly received, because all of them were declarations immediately preceding or following the act, so as to be considered as accompanying the acts of the moment—they were reccived upon the principle that declarations accompanying a fact, are a part of the fact itself; and that therefore you must receive them as circumstances of the fact; but there were neither received in evidence, nor offered, the private declarations made by that noble lord, previous to the time when he entered into that levying war, which constituted the crime of which he was accused. 
BOWER 11338 In the other case, which Mr. Erskine has stated, where the prisoner was permitted to ask what a person had heard him disclose ; that is on the principle of going to the general conduct—it was not with an intent to show that particular act, which is attributed as a crime in the prisoner, but to show that in former acts, which were considered as a part of bjs general conduct, the prisoner's disposition 
BOWER 11339 [tee was such and such upon certain subjects, nt connected immediately, not apologizing fr, and not offered as explanatory of the transactions which made the subject matter of the crime, with which he was ig ig 
BOWER 11340 In lord Russell’s case, when Dr. Borne was asked to a conversation of lord Russelfs against risings, which comes nearer than any my friend has stated, to the principle he wants to support—lIs it stated in that case, that my declaration lord Russell had made with respet to his intention, as to the rising in questea, or the facts that he was called to answer to was received as evidence—nothing like itwhen aman is charged with a particular rsing, which constitutes the particular fact o which he is accused, evidence of his genml conduct, and general character, d H of other facts, and other circumstancesare of fered to prove—not what he said respecting the fact there—but as general evidence of the conduct and intention of the party. 
BOWER 11341 As to Rosewell’s case, which was, that clergyman who had taken occasion to inst the government, had at other times preached sermons in favour of government, that coms within both principles ; the preaching a di course in favour of government at another time, is an act done strongly indicative of the intentions, and general conduct of the prisoner, to show that he was well disposed we wards povethiaent, and I give my learned friend leave, if he can in this instance, prove five hundred acts, to show that Mr. Hardy has always supported government, aot hasin his general conduct, done acts a3 D torious as the preaching of'a sermon in ap port of order, and good government. 
BOWER 11342 The case a sir ze Freind was of the same kind; the evidence was not to prow what he had done respecting the particur transaction, but to show that at differst times, when there could be no design in ve", the conversation not respecting the crime which he was then accused, sir John Freint had been speaking of government in the "J that a dutiful subject ought todo. 
BOWER 11343 In Dammaree's case, the declarations 1 ceived were directly accompanying the st: the declarations of the mob were received 35 part of the act, and upon that principle oaly. 
BOWER 11344 The case last alluded to was, I believe, Crhagan’s case, in which was given in evi against him, his declarations of coming England, to kill the king ; and his coming England coupled with other acts, to what his intention was; and there was declaration to explain the particujar act, which he at that time was accused, or which was then the subject matter of inquiry. 
BOWER 11345 ; I have before stated j om which 4 
BOWER 11346 learned friend Mr. Gi cently, and as he always does, very abl bl to expressious of good will, that is 14 which I do not deny, but the applicsto which I dispute, because I say that these & 
BOWER 11347 pressions of good will, are only received i the way that I have before stated, namely, that they are expressions at other times, upon occasions, when there is no crime imputed, when they cannot be possibly supposed to have relation to any crime, not then committed, or about to be committed, and which only shows a general good disposition— which in an equivocal act might make it doubtful, whether the party was actuated by malice toward the deceased, or not. 
BOWER 11348 But the evidence offered in this case, is of a very different complexion indecd, and such as I 
BOWER 11349 ly speak truly when I say I do not recollect ever to have been offered to a court of justice. The crime charged is, compassing the king’s death—we can give no evidence of the manner of compassing the death of the king, but by the overt acts which we have charged, and therefore the subsiance of the indictment is, that you did this overt act, from which this compassing necessarily arises; it is the act I admit to show the intent, which is just like any other fact, in any other case; it is just the same, as when we say a man committed a homicide with a felonious intent; the intent is a part of the crime—but was it ever asked, whether he had said he committed that crime, with a felonious intent
STUART 11350 it is from the acts that he has done, that you are to judge of the fact; and you cannot suffer him, by his declarations, to explain that act, by saying that he did not do it with a felonious intent —I see no difference; the intent is coupled with the act in both cases, as in all it is nothing more than this, that from the facts the intent must be inferred—from the facts here the traitorous intent must be inferred. It would not be competent to a man indicted for murder to say that lie did not do the homicide feloniously ; that he did not intend to kill the man—and it is no more evidence here when certain acts have been done, which we insist upon necessarily aitord a certain conclusion of fact, to say that he intended to do any one act with a different intent from that which is Proved by evidence to be the intent with which he acted. It appears to me, therefore, that upon no principle, and upon no authority can the evidence now offered be received, any more than it could be received if it were a declaration—I did not intend to commit a felonious murder, when I did the act. 
EYRE 11351 Mr. Erskine, I do not know whether you can be content to acseek in the opinion that we are inclined to form upon the subject, in which we go a certain way with you. Nothing is so clear as that all declarations which apply to facts, and even apply to the particular case that is charged, though the intent should make a part of that charge, are evidence against a prisoner and are not evidence for him, because the Presumption upon which declarations are evidence is, that no man would declare any thing against himself, unless it were true ; but that every man, if he was ina difficulty, or in the view to any difficulty, would make declarations for himself. Those declarations, if offered as evidence, would be offered, therefore, upon no ground which entitled them to credit. That isthe general rule. But if the question be,—as I really think it is in this case, which is my reason now for interposing, —ifthe question be, what was the politic speculative opinion which this manentertained touching a reform of parliament, I believe we all think that opinion may very well be learned and discovered by the conversations which he has held at any time, or in any place. 
ERSKINE 11352 Just so, that is my question; only that I may not get into another debate,Ibeg your lordship will hear me a few words. 
ERSKINE 11353 rd Chief Justice Eyre
STUART 11354 I think I have already anticipateda misapprehension of what Iam now stating, by saying that if the decla ration was meant to apply to a disavowal of the particular charge made against this man, that declaration could not be received; as for instance, if he had said to some friend of his, when I planned this convention I did not mean to use this convention to destroy the king and his government, but I did mean to et by means of this convention, the duke of ichmond’s plan of reform—that would fall within the rule I first laid down; that would be a declaratiog, which being for him, he could not be admitted to make, though the law will allow a contrary declaration to have been given in evidence. Now, if you take it so, I believe there is no difficulty. 
ERSKINE 11355 In the first place I cannot help lamenting that I have been throughout this whole business very considerably misunderstood. IfI had no other reason for it,— but I have another reason which I will show presently,—but if 1 had no other reason, ina place so very public as this, itis fit that I should say a few words to the Court. 
ERSKINE 11356 I agree with Mr. Solicitor General that very frequently an improper odium falls upon counsel; no man can cast his eye upon the State Trials without seeing that an improper odium has fallen upon counsel conducting causes for the crown, in consequence of that humanity which has ever been the characteristic of the English nation, Thinking so, I did that which, perhaps, would have been better hereafter: I went out of my way, and notwithstanding my weak state of health, spoke at some length, and with some anxicty, lest any man should suppose for a moment that I meant to make any such insinuation against any of the gentlemen at the bar— what return I have met with I leave to others who have heard it, to judge, without making any observartion upon it, because it is not for your lordship to redress it. 
ERSKINE 11357 With regard to Mr. Solicitor General, thus much I have a right to say, and I am bound for myself to say it, I think that any man who improperly gives offence to another, very much forgets the character that ought to beJong to him ; and if I had given any just offence to Mr. Solicitor General, I should have been the first man without any complaint from him to have given hint satisfaction for it; but on the contrary, I have a right to complain of him, for when he had asserted (I took it for granted, from not having heard what I said) that all the cases I cited were upon cross-examination, I thought it would be unmanly in me afterwards to take advantage of that remarkin my reply; therefore, in order to enable the gentleman to make such observation upon the cases I cited as would belong to them, when he stated that they were upon cross-examinations, out of a proper courtesy, and from that which belonged to the dignity of the bar, I told him that they were on original examinations, and I should have thought that would have satisfied Mr. Solicitor General that they were so; for I stated in the course of what I said, that I hadpersonally collected them, and that they were bn original examinations, After that Mr. Solicitor General goes on, and with great emphasis says, I shall still think that they vere on cross-cxamination ; I wrote it down, and every gentleman in court heard it; upon which I said I aver again that they were on original examination: “ then, he said, ah do not understand them ; to which I sai “ I see you do not. Why I would say that to any man that ever existed, here, or any where —if a mantells me that what I aver is not so, I would say to that man what I will not say here. So much for that. 
ERSKINE 11358 The attorney general says that the over-rill‘ing Providence of God superintends alike the Tich and the poor in this country, as indeed it does over the whole world, and he seemed to be offended, after 1 had read from the State Trials, what had been allowed in some illustrious cases to noblemen, and some of the first men in the kingdom, that I should speak, feeling as I must feel, if I were not worse than any man whose name is to be found in the State Trials, fecling someting for the prisoner; an allowance ought to be made for counsel for prisoners, as well as for prisoners themselves; that I should make mention of this poor shoe-maker; buthad 1 not excluded every idca of offence to the attorney 
ERSKINE 11359 neral? Could he think, with the particular Kindness with which 1 have gone out of the way to speak of him in the whole’of the cause, , 
ERSKINE 11360 ‘could any man think that I meant to bring’ back again that odium upon the counsel for. the crown which I had sought zealously to, ‘take off, and which I thought it my duty to} 
ERSKINE 11361 do out of respect'to the attorhey-zeneral? but told ‘ne, that ydir society it furnishes me with tHis obdervation, whi if there was, what I think there if tu, Fg the prisoner, it might serve hith; t shows us how little dependetice is to be hid upon words, and how little it is evidence k high treason what men who are warn wil say, because we who were thus ier be who might be imagined to be really disa! to ohe another, are persons who Iive in social life together, on terms of affection and regard; and, therefore, I am glad this happens, be cause persons may see how little we ought ’ depend upon what may be said by Mr. Yorke, or any other man, when found heated att tavern, or at an alehouse. This question refers to 4 period previow t the time of holding the convention, beh 
ERSKINE 11362 “the convention was thought of, in order show clearly that this person’s opinion, sd that his object in being a member of the Co. responding Society, and the secretary, was bring about the duke of Richmond’s object, and by the duke of Richmond’s means. If the Court will put that question I have done. 
EYRE 11363  You may put the question exactly as you propose; I confes! wished by interposing to avoid all discussiot, because I consider what we are doing, std whom we have at that bar, and in tht box, whoare suffering by every moment's th necessary delay in such a cause as this. 
ERSKINE 11364 I am sure the jury will er cuse it; I meant to set myself right st us bar: this is a very public place. 
ERSKINE 11365  Did you before the time of this convention being held, which is imputed to Mr. Hardy, ever hear from him what his objects were— whether he has at all mixed hiniselt in that business
STUART 11366 I have very often conversed wih him, as I mentioned before, about his plan of reform; he always adhertd to the duke f Richmond’s plan, and said that will be the plas that will be adopted in the end; I disagreed with him about that, and that occasioned t more particularly to be marked in my at mory ; we disputed about it, and he slways obstinately adhered toit, and stated that wte the object of the society, and his whole o ject. 
ERSKINE 11367 y Was this said in the confiderice of priratt regard, or in public company, where it might be said ostentatiously 
STUART 11368 I was never in pablic company with him ; he aud another pers were with me one night, and I have had bons and frequent conversations with him upoa subject. 
ERSKINE 11369 From all that you have seen of him, wint is his character for sincerity and truth? have every reason to believe him to be s vey sincere, siniple, honest man. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11370 If this had bea stated at first to be the question meant to askell, I do tot see what possible objectien 1 ¢guld have to it. Mr. Stuart, you bave before iad rejected oll correspondence Wit the Constititional 8d ciety 
STUART 11371 Yes. 
ERSKINE 11372 Are these the minutes of the Scotch Borough Convention ‘(Showing a pathphlet td the witness.]—They are. 
ERSKINE 11373  Were you a delegate td this convention
STUART 11374 Yes, I was. 
EYRE 11375 What is this about. 
ERSKINE 11376 I am going to prove the first convention in Scotland, because your lord- ship recollects the idea of a British Conven- tion came originally by proposition from Scotand ; it was not set on foot by either of the two societies in England. 
EYRE 11377  Recollecting what I do of the fact, I cannot concede that fact to you. 
ERSKINE 11378 We conceive that upon the evidence it is so, but we will suppose for the present that it was not, still it was 4 convention which was held, ‘not in England, but in Scotland, and the principal persons assembled in it were of that country, though upon general invitation detegates were sent from England to it. Now it becomes material in the consideration of this evidence to tnake this observation—the overt act charges this to be a convention held for the purpose of subverting the rule, order, and government of the country. I seems not to have beensufficiently attended to lately that that is theovert act, for in the course of the debate that is just finished, it looked as if it was assumedthat the overt-act was the holding a convention, but the overt-act is not for holding a convention, for any two or three people that get together may be a convention; but it isa: convention held for & ‘particular purpose, in pursuance of another purpose, which the ihdictment says ‘was, to subvert the govern-: meht
STUART 11379  That fs ‘the charge. Now I'think 1: have the authority of one of ‘your lordships since this triul cante 'on, for & papain, which, indeed, does not want stich high authority to-stipport it, that a convention may meet for legal purposes. Much has heen re-; lied wpoh in the course of the arguthent of phrases ‘being ‘used from which you shrink) back at ‘this tite, ds applicable to France ;, the pHrases of Citizen—Convention—Honourable mention, and so on. Now what I offer: in evidence is to show ‘the ‘jury, as matter of fact (yout lordsHip tepulating the trial ac. cording to the rules of law) that there were sitting at the time, and had sat before that time, and immediately before that time, two most respectable bodies of men, one of them consisting of delegates from ali the different counties of Scotland, fot obtaining a reforin in the Commons House of Parliament, and the ther & convertion of delegates ftom boroughs associated for a similar purpose. Here again I beg it may be understood, just asin the case ef the duke of Richmond, that I am not tiaras argue that, because a convehtion was held before that time by persons of any Gescription, for purposes such as expressed in that bouk, and which this gentleman, as a member, was a party to that, although these resolutions should carry with them a similarity to some that have been complained of in this case, that the quality of those that were complained of is at all altered by similarity to those that are not; but that when we are to decide what was the intention of calling this meeting & cotivention, and to rebut the presumption that they necessarily must, or might be supposed to have meant to stand upon the footing ofthe government of France, in calling their meeting a convention, and in having delegates from different societies, they were rsuing the same forms which not only had nm before that time pursued, but in fact were im the course of being pursued at the same time. The gentleman now called having been a member of that ‘convention, the ptoceedings of which assembly I now propose to lay before the Court, and that at that time it was a thing universally notorious in Scotland, that there were associations for those puroses. 
GIBBS 11380 We offer this as evidence of the fact, that there did exist meetings m Scotland which had the name of a convention of delegates, at the time Mr. Erskine has stated. 
EYRE 11381 Is it consented to on the part of the crown P 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11382 I object to it, and will state to your lordship why I do dbject to it. 
EYRE 11383 I should be unwilling to admit ‘it, if it were expressly consented to, because it would lead the jury from that which belongs to their considera tion, into a history with which we have nothing todo. The duke of Richmond’s plan ts connected with the evidence, and therefore it was proper to be prodiiced, because twenty witnesses have referred to that plan as the very grounds of their proceeding; but whether a set of gentlemen who assembled, called themselves by 8 particular name, or what passed in Scotland, or what passed in Treland ; for upon the same principle you may go to that, or to what ‘passed all over the world, for any thing I know, ‘but it entirely earties us from ‘the point, arid has in my opinion, to soft ef connexion with the case. 
ERSKINE 11384 I submit to the judgment of the Court whenever I hear it. 
GIBBS 11385  Where do you live 
STUART 11386 At Derby. 
GIBBS 11387 Are you a member of the society there
STUART 11388 Yes. 
GIBBS 11389 What are the objects of that society 
STUART 11390 A reform in the Commons House of Parliament. 
GIBBS 11391 Had you any view with respect to the other branches of the legislature, either to the King, or the Lords 
STUART 11392 No. 
GIBBS 11393 Had you, or had any of the members of your society, to your knowledge, any intent to bring about that reform by force 
STUART 11394 O dear, no—so far from it, that our society has never met since the petition to parliament was rejected. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11395 After the petitions to parliament were rejected, your society has not met
STRUTT 11396 I think Got once. 
ERSKINE 11397 I will state to your lordship that I also meant to offer another piece of evidence, in order that I may receive the judgment of the Court upon its admissibility shall present to the Court all that we conceive it our duty to present, leaving it to your lordship to decide upon the admissibility, which 1s matter of law. I was instructed to offer to your lordship evidence of associations in the year 1780 for similar purposes, followed up by resolutions extremely similar to many of those which have occupied much of the attention and consideration of the Court. I -will net take up your lordship’s time with stating at length the principle upon which 1 offer it, because I have so often stated it already; namely, that when we are trying the intention of the persons who held those assosciations, that it might be seen whether they were not following the example, no matter whether legally or illegally, of great men in their own country, instead of being supposed to be copying persons in another country, from whom they were totally distinct. 
EYRE 11398 What should I say to it if I should be of opinion that the associations of that year were high treason? 
ERSKINE 11399 That cannot be, for there is no such thing as high treason in point of law, unless the party has in his mind an intent to compass the king’s death. 
EYRE 11400 One might be compelled, for aught I can tell, to say so. 
ERSKINE 11401 It would be very difficult, I -confess, to persuade any body that almost all the great persons in this country have been in a course of committing high treason. 
EYRE 11402 I do not impute it to them, I only say that nothing that was done by any set of men ten years ago, -or at apy other time, with welch these persons tl00 
EYRE 11403 had no connexion, and to which they have not in any manner referred, can possibly influence the present case ; we cannot ingui into that transaction, or say any thing it. 
ERSKINE 11404 Mr. Sheridan, as your lorship very well knows, is amember of the Hous of Commons, I will call him to prove, that be was about to bring before the House an inquiry into any conspiracy that there might beagains the government upon this subject now under examination; that he saw the prisoner at the bar, and had communication with him long, long before the papers in his custody were seized, which are now turned inte evidence against him, as papers found clandestinely in his custody as a criminal. I call Mr. She ridan to prove, if the fact be so, that Mr. Hardy offered to come forward to give al assistance, to lay every thing voluntarily be fore the parliament in examination of this matter, which has since been made the sub ject of inquiry in a court of criminal justice. I produce this evidence because it affordss presumption of his innocence, 
ERSKINE 11405  Do you know the prisoner at the bar
STRUTT 11406 I saw the prisoner once, and but once, I think, to my knowledge. 
ERSKINE 11407 When was that
STRUTT 11408 I think in the beginniog of the month of March, 1793. 
ERSKINE 11409 Upon what occasion was it that you saw him 
STRUTT 11410 I had given notice in the Hous of Commons that I intended very shortly bring forward a motion, the object of whicd was similar to that which was adopted ia the last session; namely to propose a committe to inquire inito the seditions or plots, and the general proceedings of the societies which were then supposed to be promoting sedition or treason in the country.. 
ERSKINE 11411 At that time was the convention which had been assembled in Scotland sitting, had it been dispersed 
STRUTT 11412 I do not recollect. 
ERSKINE 11413 Upon what occasion did you send for Mr. Hardy, or did he wait upon you
STRUTT 11414 I sent to him. I will state very shortly what I undestand from the conversation which pased, and which, I have been informed, is material for the prisoner. Having given this notice in the House of Commons, I thought it my duty to make every inquiry I could into the fact of the existence of these seditious societies, and into their conduct, being myself certainly a great disbeliever in the suppposed plots, to the extent to which they were stated or of the conspiracies which were supposed to be be brewing in this society. I conversed with a gentleman upon the subject; he among other modes of inquiry, named to me Mr. Hardy, and he stated him as a person whom he conceived incapable of giving into any such plans, and who, he thought, could give me every information upon the subject. I said I should be glad to see him: Mr. Hardy accordingly came to me. I took the precaution, not certainly arising from any thing that I heard of the character of Mr. Hardy, to have two gentlemen present at the conversation, one of which was Mr. Stuart, who was lately examined; I showed Mr. Hardy a publication which had been delivered at the doors of the House of Commons, and of the House of Lords, reporting the proceedings and the addresses of those sgcieties, and giving a list of the different public houses at which the societies met; he went over that book with me, and complaint that it calumnniated the society he belonged to, and its proceedings. 
EYRE 11415 It is not quite regular to go into a general narration, which nay inte luce a great deal of matter which will not be evidence ; the point you are called upon to prove is that Mr. Hardy, upon your conversing with him, offered to assist you in disclosing every thing he knew, and to assist you in bringing forward the inquiry, because asto his declaration beyond that it may not be evidence
STRUTT 11416 I certainly will confine myself to ‘that ; I should say that Mr. Hardy: observed that the information apparently obtained by government was extremely accurate; that the places mentioned as their places of meetings were extremely correct; 
EYRE 11417 e afterwards said that the object of the society was very much mis-stated, for that they had nothing in view but a parliamen teform according to the plan of the duke of Richmond. 
EYRE 11418 Not what his conduct was upon it—his opinion. 
ERSKINE 11419 What his object was upon it 
SHERIDAN 11420 Mr. Erskine stated the intention of calling me was to that point; but if I was misled in adding something to it that was not evidence, it was from the fact of a witness just now at the bar having expressly stated that circumstance himself, as having passed between him and Mr. Hardy. 
ERSKINE 11421 I should not have presumed to have aked Mr. Stuart the question, What was the object of the society? without your lordship’s permission, but he said that Mr. Hardy declared his own object, and that of the society to be, a parliamentary reform upon the duke of Richmond's plan. 
EYRE 11422 The declaration of the object of the society, and how it was to be pursued, may be a very different thing. 
ERSKINE 11423 What did he declare the object of the society to be
STRUTT 11424 The whole object of the society, and his own ohject to be, obtaining by peaceable means, a parliamenwy teform upon the duke of Richmond’s 
ERSKINE 11425 Will you be so good as state what assistance he offered you 
STRUTT 11426 He went through the list of these places, and upon my interrogating him, certainly not Presuming that Te was bound to answer the question, upon asking him the fact, whether these societies, having been dispersed, they continued to meet at these public houses ; he declared they did not; that in consequence of this publication of government these houses considered themselves as marked, and stating that their members were not persons who spent much money at public houses, that without much reluctance the landlords of those houses had refused to let them meet at their houses. I asked him if they still continued to meet, he said distinctly that they did; that he knew they were watched by government, and had no objection to its being known that all the societies continued to meet in private houses, and he had no objection, he said, to give me the list of the houses where they met, for my information, and that I might read it, if I pleased, in the House of Commons. 
ERSKINE 11427 Did he know at this time that you had intended making a motion in the House of Commons upon the subject 
STRUTT 11428 I told him that satel ; I took down a great many of the private houses where he said they met; I dare say I did not preserve the paper, but I had it in my hand when J moved the next day in the House of Commons for a committee to inquire into the conduct of these societies. 
ERSKINE 11429 Whether in stating the pursuit which parliament had in view, he offered you any farther assistance that might eventually be necessary in the investigation of all that in fact had been done
STRUTT 11430 He offered me every assistance and information in his power—he offered me a sight of the whole correspondence, copies of all his letters, if 1 chose it, and expressed an eaee wish that my motion might e successful for an inquiry into the conduct of these societies. 
ERSKINE 11431 I observe you have been pet durin; most of these proceedings; I wish to as whether he fisted you a sight of those apers which have been seized, and you have Foerd read here in evidence
STRUTT 11432 He offered me a sight of the whole of his papers, and every book in his possession. 
ERSKINE 11433 Was that in consequence of any demand of yours, peremptorily as a member of parliament, or a magistrate, or was it a voluntary offer on his part, considering you as a private member of parliament
STRUTT 11434 Certainly a voluntary offer, appearing to me to arise froma very sincere wish, on his part, that an investigation might be instituted. 
ERSKINE 11435 Richard Brindsley Sheridan, esq. cross-ex amined by Mr. Attorney General. 
ERSKINE 11436 I understand that this was in the beginning of the year 1793
STRUTT 11437 I think in March, 1793, I made the motion, and I am pretty confident this conversation was the very evening before I made the motion. 
ERSKINE 11438 Did I understand you right, that you showed him some book 
STRUTT 11439 I showed him a book, a publication supposed to proceed from the treasury, which had been delivered to the members of both Houses, and which he complained yery much calumpiated the proceedings of these societies. 
ERSKINE 11440 He did not offer to show you a book that was a Journal of their proceedings 
STRUTT 11441 He offered to show me the abo of the papers and books of his society. 
ERSKINE 11442 Do you take upon yourself to say that he offered to show you books, or a book, or any Journal 
STRUTT 11443 He offered in general to give every information as to the proceedings which be could give; he said he had no concealment, that he wished to show me any papers, books, or proceedings of the society; I cannot recollect whether he said a book or books, but I must be understood when I say he offered generally to give me every information ia hi power. 
ERSKINE 11444 T understood you that he meant to give you all the written information that in the beginning of the year 1798 he could give; but I have an important reason for desiring that he mey not be prejudiced by your recollection, when yau state the ward Jaurnal or Book.— Did he offer to give you the correspondence and a Journal or Book 
STRUTT 11445 It is impossible for me to say that he-used-the word Journal, or whether he said Book, or Books; but I am positive in the recollection that he offered to show me the papers of the Corresponding Society. 
ERSKINE 11446 No Book or Journal of the Corresponding Society has been produced; I svish, therefore, to know whether yqu mean -yoursclfto say that he did mention ‘the word’ J wrnal, or the word :Book, because I wish if yaur recollection is not accurate to, the ward Journal ar Book, hat that expression may be dropped, jnasmuch as that a bate may give rise to an observation 
STRUTT 11447 I have just distinctly said that I am not positive whether he said Journal or Book, but his offer was to show ,me all the papers and other correspondence, and to .conceal nathing fram me; how, he made that offer ZT cannot expressly recollect, hut the impression on my mnind was that he meant to withhold nothing from me, but ,to give me whatever materials were in his power, ,whether Rooke, taoals or whatever they might be. 
EYRE 11448 Your Srst aX
EYRE 11449 pression, asf have taken it, was “the whole correspondence? — The whole correspgndence. 
EYRE 11450 I do not knaw Sie thes Mr. Sheridan used the word “ Joyrnal. : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11451 Mr. Sheridan did, and I rather doubted whether that was from general recollection, or precise and accurate recollection. 
SHERIDAN 11452 I made no note of the conversation; I cannot be accurate as .to the terms, but must be understvod when I say that his offer was to put me in possessiqgn of all the papers, and. to give me every. verbal, information, 
SHERIDAN 11453 You had no conversation with;bim about 
SHERIDAN 11454 Paine’s publications
STRUTT 11455 I dq pot think 3 sla. ble passed upog that 4 
SHERIDAN 11456 T understand you that be invited your m. tion in the House of Commons, which wou have given authority to the House of Con mons to bring all bis papers before it
STRUTT 11457 Up questionably. 
SHERIDAN 11458 He knew yqu were member of parliament. and invited your motiop upon that subject!— I stated my intended design to him, and th: I hoped it would succeed. 
SHERIDAN 11459 Are you a member of the Constitutional & ciety? —I do not know whetherIam oroot,! was an original wember with the duke ci Richmond; I do not know whether I hae formally withdrawn my name, but I haveoot attended since the year 1783. 
ERSKINE 11460  Do you know the prisaner at the bar
STRUTT 11461  I do not recollect his persan again, but I bare seen him twice. 
ERSKINE 11462 Upon what occasiqn was jt that yu ay him
STRUTT 11463 I recollect that 1 have seen hin twig, and Ihelieve that is all. The first timeahis own house in Piccadilly, in consequence ofa detier, or some normaton hick heoommaupicated to. me, thatit wap the intention of the society, of which he was the secretary, a to which he belonged, to return me thei hanks for a speech concerning the refouof Pan jament, w ee oe in the House of Cammons, think I ano prefty accune in bee that was their desire ye pee the 1 S, ir society ; d wept to bim to tell ra I was satisfied Baas thanks, and wished them to decline printing that ba qe first heres seeing“fhe 
ERSKINE 11464 Then was that
STRUTT 11465 In the beginning oe On or before. the neat May, 1733, 
ERSKINE 11466 e .was sent tome as secretaxy of that sooty to which he belongs, fo desire thatIwut present a petition from them to parliament upon the subject of a reform ,in pasli and he desired that I would permit bim asl some athers, who were to act as delegates, oF who. were deputed from, the society to me, & come:to my hause, which, they did. Idesre! to see the petition of course before I preseo it;.they brought the petition yhe was, I thi. rather the spokesman; there were four them, Mr. Margarot was one, and there wert others whose names I do not believe I eet knew. ,lread the petition; .I said as to the form of the petition, it seems perfedly spectful to. the House of Commons, and thinking it the right of the subject, upon all occasions, to petition the House of Commons, or any other branch of the legislature, I had no objection to deliver their petition, but then I told them I had an objection to the prayer of the petition, and I advised them that I must at the same time that I delivered it, declare a utterly adverse to the prayer of it, which was that the redress for the grievances of which they complained, in the body of the petition, should be by granting to the people Of this country what they called universal sentation according to the plan laid down ! by the duke of Richmond. i "That the reform they wanted was according ! toa plan which youdid not approve
STRUTT 11467 I treated it as I have done upon all other occasions; J treated the idea of universal suffrage with ; the utmost disapprobation, and I told them that if I did present the petition, they ought to know that I should at the same time de-clare, as I did when I presented it declare, 6 thatIhad nothing to do with the prayer of it, not that it was illegal, but that im my idea it Was improper. 
ERSKINE 11468 Having offered to you a petition which you Beige perfectly legal, tut the prayer of i which for universal suttrage did not agree 
ERSKINE 11469 ; with your private opinion; what was Slr. 
ERSKINE 11470 Hardy's answer to that
STRUTT 11471 Mr. Margarot was the spokesman rather more than Mr. Hardy; Mr. Hardy was present, and 1 perfectly re
ERSKINE 11472 ; member, for I took notice of it in speaking of this matter, that Mr. Hardy seemed a most 
ERSKINE 11473 ; Yemarkably reasonable, quiet man; when Speaking of this matter it struck me so both then, and when I saw bim in his sbop. Upon 
ERSKINE 11474 Stating these objections, Mr. Margarot and the other two were very ready, and their readiness surprised me, in maintaining the arguments that might be urged on the part of universal representation. I expressed my surprise that men of their rank in life should have the command of such arguments, they said it was not surprising, for they only follows ed the opinions of the duke of Richmond, and they said whatever my opinion might be, Lcould hardly make it better. Upon my making this difficulty to present their petition, and stating that, instrict parliamentary propriety, a petition to the House ought to leave the remedy, whatever it might be, in general terms to the wisdom of the House; and that even if I had approved their idea of universal representation, I should have recommended them to leave the prayer of their petition open ina general way; they said that for their part, I felievs Mr. Hardy took it upon himself when he said this, and I took notice of the quietness, moderation, and simpticity of the man, as well as bis good sense; he said in return to that, that he was sorry they had not known my vbjection sooner, or to that effect. [have had occasion to recite the circumstances now stated tu the Court upon another occasion, which makes me more accurate concerning them; some time ago when I was called upon to mention them at .a meeting of our own society; I mention that only to account for being so accurate, they said they were sorry they had not known my objections sooner, that it would have been indifferent to them whether they should have stated the prayer as they had done, or lett it open; but that now they could not alter it, because the petition wasalready signed by a great number, I believe nine thousand ; that it must be presented that day, the 6th of May, because on that day Mr. Grey had given notice of his motion concerning a reform of parliament, and it was indispensably necessary it should be presented that day, that made it impossible they could alter the prayer of the petition, being signed by great numbers. I said very well, they knew my thoughts upon the subject, and if they were content that I should present their petition, making that declaration concerning the prayer of it, I was ready to do it; accordingly I did so, and stated to the House my objection to it, 
ERSKINE 11475 Had it not been that the forms of the House would not admit of the time, did there appear a readiness and willingness to have made it conformable to your recommendation
STRUTT 11476 Yes, remarkably so; and I was very glad to have that to state to the House. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11477  You have said that there was a remarkable readiness to have changed the prayer of the petition, if there had been time enuugh
FRANCIS 11478 I thought so. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11479 Wad you any reason to believe (indeed I am almost ashamed to ask the question)—had you any reason to believe at the time that they waited upon you with this petition, that they had no anxiety at all about the success of it
FRANCIS 11480 On the contrary, they seemed very eager about it. There is a circumstance which I do not know whether it is material. Mr. Hardy told me they had asked Mr. Fox to present this petition, and that he had declined it, because he was an enemy to unlversal suftrage. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11481 I believe that was mentioned in the letter to you
FRANCIS 11482 And that Mr. Fox had declined it because he disagreed with them in the prayer of the petition. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11483 Then in effect, as it struck your mind, they appeared extremely desirous that the petition should be presented, and were extremely willing that the prayer should be altered according to your ideas, if time would have permitted 
FRANCIS 11484 They were extremely desirous to have it presented, and very ready to have left it generally to the wisdom of the House. I am pretty sure, indeed I am certain, that they for their parts, would have been very well contented to have left itso, if they had been sooner upprized of the forms of the House. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11485 They held the language then of men desirous to have a parliamentary reform to the extent the wisdom of parliamont it them, and not to use a language which amounted to a determination to accept of nothing less than universal suffrage and annual parliaments
FRANCIS 11486 They did not give up, as the object of their wishes, universal suffrage and annual representation, but what they were ready to give up, and did give up, was, to change the form of the prayer of their petition. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11487 I dare say they did not express to you their determination that they would accept nothin from the legislature but universal suffrage an annual parliaments 
FRANCIS 11488 Certainly not—I would Not have had any thing to do with them if they had usedsthat language. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11489 I think you said they had determined to print their letter of thanks to you
FRANCIS 11490 That was sometime hefore. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11491 You told them you totally disapproved of the method of universal suffrage and annual representation
FRANCIS 11492 Yes ; that was on the 6th of May. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11493 Did you happen to know that they had published what you desired should not be published, together with a pretty strong letter preceding, which I will show you
FRANCIS 11494 No; I do not think they did at all publish it, at least Not in a newspaper. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11495 Please to see if this is an accurate copy of the answer you sent them 
FRANCIS 11496 [showing it to Mr. Francis.]—I believe it is. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11497 Is the letter which precedes it the letter you received before you presented the petition 
FRANCIS 11498 I dare say it is, but I had totally forgot the letter. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11499 Have you any doubt about it
FRANCIS 11500 No, I have not; I see now plainly that they had totally mistaken me,

P. ror Hs ABLE SPEECH IN PARLIAMENT, ON THE TENTH OF APRIL, 1793, UPON THE STOCKBuIDGE ELecTion BILL; TOGETHER WITH HIS ANSWER, A Letter of Thanks, by the London Corresponding Socicty, to PhiJip Francis, Esq. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11502 “ Sir, The Committee of Delegates of the London Corresponding Society, having perused with considerable pleasure your truly patriotic speech of the 10th instant, in favour of a radical reform in the representation of the people, think it incumbent on them, as friends to reform on that broad basis, for which you have so ably contended, toreturn you their sincerest thanks, and to express their obligations for your support of a cause, to which their every exertion has long been devoted. United as we ure upon the firmest and most patriotic principles, and with the purest of all possible intentions, the good of our country; it gives us the must heartfelt: satisfaction to see that those principles aud those intentions are pot confined to ourselves, but that there yet exists im the Units Senate a Patriot, who dares speak truth in the cause of his country, and plead for the people in the face of corruption. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11503 “ Too long has the cause of the people lay guished ; influence, interest, or prejudice have precluded knowledge from the senate; or not precluded, nearly overpowered. The people have seen with sorrow their happiness disregarded, and their rights undefended: the opposition of political warfare has been the effect of party, and the exertion of ability bsd interest for its stimulus. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11504 “ Roused from its torpor, the nation hasat last begun To THINK FOR ITsELF. Systems! communication have been formed, and me diums devised to collect the public voice— Mediums independent of influence, or comp tion: such is our society ; and from thatciety, you, Sir, are reise’ to accept the thanks of an obliged body of men, whith knows equally how to value its rights, a esteem the supporters of them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11505 We have but to wish that from exertions able, so disinterested as your’s, the cause a the people may be impartially debated in pr liament ; and we trust when that is the ay, the distinction of party will cease, ands par liamentary reform take place upon the ground of equal right. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11506 Should our hopes in this respect prove abxtive, it is impossible to say where may that spirit of Inquiry, which has gone forth among a people, who have not forgot that they are entitled to freedom, and who cannot tamely see themselves plundered of their rights—We are, Sir, with sincere respect, your highly obliged, and very humble servants, for the committee of the London Corresponding ciety.

ATTORNEYGENERAL 11507 . HARDY, Secrelary. April 21st, 1793. Philip Francis, esq., St. James’s-square.. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11508 “ St. James's- square, April 92d, 119. gentlemen, I received with great ple sure the favour of your letter, and ackno ledge it with many thanks, which I beg 1 will express for me to the committee of dekgatcs of your society, and to the societystlzt
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11509 “ With respeet to a parliamentary refer, the utmost that can be done by a few indirduals in the House of Commons, and all thst can be expected from them is, to take ev’? favourable occasion to agitate the questo and to bring the subject as often as thes a into public view and discussion. f the people of this country in genera ; were as hearty and diligent as your soul! ‘supporting the measure by declarations petitions, should have little doubt of ss cess. Without that support, success net possible. On my part, you may be sure every thing in my power shall be done ! tain it, I am, gentlemen, your mot dient, humble servant, P, Feu o the chairman and secretary of the committee of delegates ofthe London Corresponding Society. 
ERSKINE 11510 The reading this letter, which I did not call for, gives me an opportunity of asking you, whether you would have answered that letter in the manner you have done, if you had the smallest reason in the world to belicve that these people were pursuing their object by such means as are charged ! to them here this day
FRANCIS 11511 My auswer is in 1 general terms of civility, I was not very ambitious of their praise, and did not wish to enter anto any arguinent with them; most assuredly if I had thought that they had any other views but to obtain a reform of parliament, and that in a proper way by application to parliament, and by instructions from the People to their representatives, and such modes as I conceive the laws of this country to authorize; ifIhad conceived them to have had any other object, I should not only have abstained from corresponding with them, but have considered them as very dangerous men. I thought them very much mistaken and absurd upon the point, but I did not enter into an argument with them. 
ERSKINE 11512 The evidence on the part of the crown has been divided into two branches first to prove by the language and writings of those who have been members of different societies, what their objects were. Secondly, to see how far the prisoner could be legally involved in these objects. In consequence of that, many writings and declarations of Skirving and others, who were delegates to the convention at Edinburgh, have been given in evidence; what I propose to prove to your lordships is, that lord Lauderdale, a peer of the realm, as your lordship knows, had a letter written to him, requesting him to accept the office of delegate in the British Convention for one of the societies comprehended in the scope of this conspiracy. It would, therefore, be very unreasonable to suppose that their intention was to destroy the honours of the nobleman to whom this letter was addressed. If your lordships think it evidence I will offer it. Itis dated the 26th of October, just before the British Convention was held. 
ERSKINE 11513  I wish your lordship to look at that letter . Did you receive it
FRANCIS 11514 I received it just at the time it bears date. 
ERSKINE 11515 Did your lordship know at that time that the British Convention, as it was called, was about to be assembled
FRANCIS 11516 I certainly did. 
ERSKINE 11517 I understand your lordship declined being a delegate
FRANCIS 11518 I did; it was an application from a society of the Friends of the People in Portsburgh, part of the suburbs of Edinburgh. 
ERSKINE 11519 Was your lordship at that time in Scotland
FRANCIS 11520 I had just arrived at Edinburgh. 
ERSKINE 11521 Were you informed at that time that the different socicties in England, and also the difJerent societies in Scotland, were sending delegates to this society Yes, I was, 
ERSKINE 11522 Did you give any answer to that letter? Yes; I wrote an answer. 
ERSKINE 11523 I cannot ask whit the answer was.—Did you see the persons who brought the letter 
FRANCIS 11524 N o, I never did; I saw the secretary, Mr. Skirving, autecedently to having received this letter, aud I rather suspect that the offer was made to me in consequence of the conversation which passed between him and me. Mr. Skirving then wrote to Mr. Stuart, requesting the Society of the Friends of the People to appoint a delegate to the British Convention, I believe Mr. Stuart’s answer, which has been since printed was, that the society not meeting at that time, it was impossible that they could appoint a delegate, but he dare say that any thing I should do would afterwards be approved by the society; an answer I thought rather extraordinary. Mr. Skirving called upon me several times, and pressed me to take up this idea of Mr. Stuart’s; I objected, he pressed it upon this ground, that if men of education would come amongst them, it might prevent them from falling into absurdities, which otherwise their keeuness and cagerness might lead them to. I declined still to attend upon the ground that Mr. Stuart had proposed ; I suspected he had got them to make this representation to me. This letter was written from a Mr. Moffatt, whom I have since known, because he acted as private agent for Mr. Muir and Mr. Fulmer. 
ERSKINE 11525 Is he a man of character
FRANCIS 11526 I then knew nothing of him, I have scen a great deal of him since that period, andInever knewa more humane map, nor, I believe, a better man. 
ERSKINE 11527 From any thing you saw at the time these applications were made, had you any reason to believe or suspect that the members of this convention were callcd together to assume the power of government
FRANCIS 11528 The language was quite the reverse among themselves, that their plan was universal suffrage aud annual parliaments, 
ERSKINE 11529 Was there any thing that led you to believe that that was to be accomplished by force and violence, overpowering and overturning the different branches of our government
FRANCIS 11530 Certainly nothing of the sort. 
ERSKINE 11531 I put it in the most unqualified way
FRANCIS 11532 O certainly not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11533 Your lordship had not heard of a letter that Skirving had written to Hardy in July, 1793, that has been read in evidence 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11534  At that tine T had not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11535 Nor any of those other letters 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11536 No. 
ERSKINE 11537 Will you give me leave to ask my lord Lauderdale what change of opinion these letters have made upon him? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11538 That is for the jury. 
ERSKINE 11539 It is for the jury both ways,because your question infers, that if his lord ship had seen these letters, his opinion would have been the other way. 
ERSKINE 11540 “ My lord ; Permit me, in name of man’

ERSKINE 11544 My lords, I have now closed the defence of Mr. Hardy. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11545 Before Mr. Gibbs goes on with the defence, there is a letter rom Ashton, of the 26tb of May, 1792, which 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11546 I wish to have read; it was meant to be read, but was forgotten; it is by mistake dated 1797. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11547 “ Sheffield Society for Constitutional InJormation, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11548 “Mr. Adams, Sir; Your favour of Srd ult. came duly to hand, the acceptance of our twelve friends as members of your's, is highly Satisfactory to this society, and I am directed by them ‘to request you will be pleased to present their sincere thanks to your society or their affectionate regard for, and honour couterred upon the members of this instituion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11549 t is with pleasure we congratulate you on the rapid progress of real and useful knowledge, and the dissipation of ignorance and error from among the general inass of the people. Knowledge once obtained cannot be obliterated, but by the loss, orabuse of reason: truth once fairly discovered and substantiated cannot be defaced by the sophistry and wicked designs of artful and: crafty men. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11550 “We are happy to inform you that the number of our associating, or ticket, members, keep increasing, are now about 2,400, but they have not increased of late in proportion with our worthy and respectable Trends, who (altho’ they do not associate with us as an incorporate body) have manifested themselves in a way of respectability, adding strength and support to the undertakings of this society, and to the cause in general. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11551 “ On Saturday last, 19th inst. we received a packet of printed addresses, resolves, &c. from the society (Freemasons tavern) which, on mature consideration, we find ourselves not so well reconciled to the ideas they convey to us as we could wish, if they had appeared in a different point of view, nor do they afford us such a flattering prospect as we were apprehensive might be expected from an association of so respectable a body, under the high denomination of the Friends of the People. In our opinion, their answer of 12th inst. & your ictter of 27th ult. is no ways compatible with that appellation; from the known respeetability of many names which appear amonest them, we had entertained great hopes of their teal use in obtaining a thorough reform pon the principles of the Rights of Man, which can never be accomplished, until every mas enjoys his lawful and just privileges. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11552 “ Previous to the reception of this packet, we did communicate to them, by letter, the leasing hopes it reflected to us, 00 lookieg jorward, viewing such respectable characters signalizing themselves in support of the people’s rights, agreeable to the above pra ciples, and the denomination by which they have entitled themselves, &c. In due course they would receive our letter last Thursday se’nnight, and in consequence we apprehend the packet was forwarded to us on the same day, but without any written communicatios: we shall not attempt any farther communica tion with them, until we are favoured with your sentiments upon the subject, or uott matters of doubt which we at present entertam, be, removed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11553 “We also received a packet from the Friends of the People, Southwark, and they have our hearty concurrence and best wishes; we shall in a day or two forward our reply to them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11554 “We have also becn favoured with a affectionate communication from our friends and fellow labourers at Manchester, and from several other places, who are about to form themselves into societies; Birmingham im particular claims all the assistance trom est blished societies which possibly can be administered, there are great numbers in that place friendly to the cause of the people, and we hope (notwithstanding the late tragical wracsactions) if prudent methods are adopted and pursued, the people’s attention may be turned to their own interest, and the mouths of dev pots and ranting bigots stopped, which is, and must be the sincere wish of every real friend to the peace and welfare of mankind.

ATTORNEYGENERAL 11556 Iopes you will excuse for troubling you with the inclosed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11557 “ N.B. Our worthy friend, Vicinus, is Mr. John Payne, of Newhill, near Sheffield, and one of our friends whom you were pleased to accept as a member of your society. (Addressed) “ Mr. Adams, Tooke'scourt, Chancery-lane, London. 
GIBBS 11558 May it please your Lordships; Gentlemen of the jury; I need not state tot you the anxiety that I must necessarily feeltreason; and you are bound to inquire of upon this occasion, oppressed by the weightnothing that is not there charged. ofa cause under which the mighty abilities ofmy learned friend could hardly support him. 1 But, gentlemen, if Ican, I will do my duty to that miserable man at the bars if my strength 1! enables me to go through the defence which 1 I bave undertaken, I will defend him; it is 1 not a wish to spare my own strength, it is nota wish to spare my own health which hasoverpowered me, but it is because I have felt this cause too great for me; I have felt myself incapable of comprehending, in my mind, the vast mass of evidence which the crown has ; produced against this man. No time which the indulgence of the Court has allowed me, 1 Do industry of my own (in which, I assure you, I have not failed) has enabled me so to conceive, in my mind, this vast cause, as to State it intelligibly to you; for so, and so only does the interest of the prisoner, and public Justice, require that it should be stated. Gentlemen, you will remember that, in the outset, it took the attorney gencral nine hours Merely to open this case; a length of speech unheard of; the annals of this kingdom do Rot afford an instance of a prosecution founded en so many complicated facts, drawn out of such a tangled web, that less than a speech of nine hours could not render it intelligible to the jury, nor explain to them by what mode of reasoning it was meant to bring the imputed charge home to the prisoner. 
GIBBS 11559 To suppose that the attorney general has stated his case at greater length, or burthened it with more evidence than in his judgment was necessary, would be casting an unworthy reflection on him. His known character renders it impossible. ‘The prosecution itself must be thought to have required for its support this mass of evidence, which it is our duty, as counsel for the prisoner, to observe upon, but impossible, in the time allowed us, to understand. ‘This it is that weighs us down. —Remember the situation in which my jearned friend, Mr. Erskine was; you saw how even he was oppressed by it; it was not possible for human ability, and I feel it so, because it was not possible for his standing up to repel a charge drawn by such subtle reasoning, out of such a complication of facts ; it was not possible for the ability of man so to coraprehend and embrace, in his mind, those facts, as to enable him to lay before you a fair defence for the prisoner. 
GIBBS 11560 Gentlemen, in order to make what I have to address to you upon this subject intelligible, it is necessary that I should first state to you what I conceive the law of the subject to be, and what questions that law submits to your consideration in the present case. This is to be looked for—First, m the indictment; next, in the statute upon Which the indictment is founded. 1 say it is to be looked for in the indictment, because it is necessary that the indictment should charge the prisoner with some fact or facts, which, in law, amount to 
GIBBS 11561 The charge against the prisoner is, that he has compassed the king’s death, and that, for the purpose of carrying that design, entertained against the king’s life, into execution, he has done certain acts stated in the indictment. 
GIBBS 11562 The treason charged is, that he compassed the king’s death; the means by which he is stated to have endeavoured to effect this purpose, are, 
GIBBS 11563 First, hat he, with others, met, and conspired to. procure a convention and meeting, with intent, and in order that the persons to be assembled at such convention and Meeting, should and might, wickedly and traitorously, without, and in defiance of the authority, and against the will of the parliament of this kingdom, subvert and alter, and cause to be subverted and altered, the legislature, rule, and government, now duly and happily established in this kingdom, and depose, and cause to be deposed, our said lord the king
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11564 That is the first overt act stated in the indictment; it is not necessary for me to state the other overt acts relative to the convention, because in reality their tendency is the same; it only states the different means they touk in order to procure that convention, the ultimate end of which the charge states, was to accomplish the king's death. There are other acts charged, stating, that the defendant conspired “ to levy war against the king, for the purpose of deposing him. Another charge is, that “they did mect, conspire, consult and agree among themselves, and with divers other false traitors, whose names are to the said jurors unknown, to raise, levy, and make insurrection, rebellion, and war within this kingdom, against our said lord the king. So that you see the charges, stated in the indictment, against the prisoner, are these —The first is an act of his mind, that he compassed the death of the king. The next is, that, in order to carry into execution that design, to destroy the king, he did certain acts, stated in the indictment, which acts are alleged to have an immediate view of deposing the king; and from that immediate view of deposing the king, you are desired to infer, that the ultimate object was to accomplish the king’s death. 
GIBBS 11565 This indictment is founded upon the statute of Edward the third, upon which my learned friend argued very ably and elaborately. You observe that, before this statute, different opinions had been entertained as to what was, and what was not treason; and men had been drawn into the penalties of treason, without suspecting that they had incur them. 
GIBBS 11566 The statute recites, ‘ that divers opinions had been entertained in what case treasqn shall be said, and in what not; and therefore the king, at the request of the Lurds, and of the Commons, makes a declaration of what shall be treason; that is to say, when a man doth compass or imagine the death of our lord the king, or our lady his queen, or of their eldest son and heir, and thereof be provably attainted of open deed by the people at of their condition, it is to be understood t in that case it ought to be judged treason, that is, high treason. 
GIBBS 11567 Then the statute goes on with a declaration that nothing but that, which is precisely expressed and specified in the statute, shall be treason : “ And because that many other like cases of treason may happen in time to come, which a man cannot think nor declare at this present time, it is accorded, that if any other case, supposed treason, which is not above specified, doth happen before any justices, the justices shall tarry, without any going to judgment of the treason, till the cause be shuwed and declared before the king and his parliament, whether it ought to be judged treason or other felony. 
GIBBS 11568 You have then the indictment stating these points, which yuu are to consider, whether ! the prisoner compassed the king’s death, and ! whether he committed these acts with an intent immediately to depose the king, ie ne main charge is, that he compassed the king’s death. ‘Ihis is the only treason, presented by the indictment, to your inquiry; and this isthe ila have been legally stated in the indictment, since the statute of the 25th of Edward Srd; if this indictment hadvaried from the statute in charging any thing dues not make so, it would be erroneous: if former indictments, from the time of passing the statute to the present, had varied from it, without being noticed, that would not alter the law ultimately to accomplish his death. 
GIBBS 11569 only form in which it cou as treason which the statute upon the subject, because in cases arisin; upon a statute, no established form of legal proceedings can control the statute, but must e corrected by it. 
GIBBS 11570 In this case, however, the form of the indictment and the statute go hand in hand; it appears frum each that nothing shall be treason (nothing, at least, necessary to be considered upon the present occasion), except the compassing the king’s death. You will observe the statute says likewise, that the party must be “ provably attainted of open deed by the people of his condition. Now, upon this statute, lord Coke, who was one of the most learned lawycrs that has ever lived, has commented, and I shall take the liberty shortly of stating his comment, at least that particular part of it, because that will point out to you how careful the law is, and how careful all writers upon the law are, to guard judges and juries against ever extending this statute; it points out the method you ought to use in investigating the charge brought against the prisoner, and therefore I trust it will not be thought useless if I state it to you. 
GIBBS 11571 The treason charged is, you see, a compassin the king’s death; there must be in the min king’s death, but that must be proved to a jury by his acts, and on that part of the su tute in which the legislature says, “ that thr parly shall be provably attainted of ojeo deed by the people of their conditiun, lod Coke has thus commented. gentlemen, where your recollection goes to the argumett of Mr. Erskine, which passed some time ago. Tam sure you will regret that I should repat it, but I will only endeavour to bring bac those things which may have escaped you. Lord Coke says, (3 inst. 12.) “ In ths branch four things are to be observed. Fir, this word provably, that is, upon direct, mnifest proof, not upon conjectural presump tions, or inferences, or strains of wit, tut upon good and sufficient proof; and heria the adverb (provablement) provably hth: great force, and significth a direct and pho proof, which word the King, the Lords ai Commons in parliament did use, for that the offence was so heinous, and was so hesviy and so severely punished, as none other tte like, and therefore the offender must praca be attainted, which. words are as forcibieas upon direct and manifest proof. Note, the word is not probably, for then commune crgvmentum might have served, but the word is procably be attainted. ; This you see, gentlemen, is an exhortation to you who are to find whether the prisuner or is not guilty; that you do not find bin guilty, without plain, direct, and manic! proof—this is the proof which the legislate requires for the purpose of fixing this noe upon the prisoner; this is the proof which a course you, who are the jury to try his quit innocence, must be satisfied has been zea in the cause, before you can find him gulls. Gentlemen, I will trouble you tarther. merely with a statement of the way in whica judges who have had to try causes upva ths statute, have laid down the law to the Juv. I shall then have stated to you the indictuert —the statute upon which it is founded, the construction of one of the most learned lsyers who ever lived upon that statute, andtie acting of one of the most learned judges a has ever adorned the bench (I speak of chief justice Pemberton) when he sat on bt trial of lord Russell, who was charged with aa offence of the same sort as that with whi! 
GIBBS 11572 alluded to in court, and not from the ba, bet from the bench. I have heard the sm rible treason and traitorous compassings, imaginations, and purposes aforesaid, he, the said William Russell, together with other false traitors, maliciously, traitorously, and advi-sedly between themselves, and with divers other traitors to the jurors unknown, did meet tovether, consult, agree, and conclude insurrection and rebellion against our sovereign lord the king within this kingdom of England, to move and stir up, and the guards fur the preservation of the person of our said Lord the king to seize and destroy, against the duty of his allegiance. So you see the charge in that indictment was, that lord Russell had compassed the king’s death, and to effect that treason, had conspired to raise insurrection and rebellion against the king, and to seize the ds appointed for the preservation of the king’s person. The evidence given in that case went certainly to show, if it went to show any thing, that lord Russell had conspired to raise insurrection and rebellion in the kingdom, and to seize the king’s guards, and yet lord chief justice Pemberton in summing up (Istate this to show what is the matter for you to inquire into in this case) does not tell the jury that the point for them to consider is, whether the prisoner had conspired to raise insurrection and rebellion against the person of the king ; and if they found that, they must find the prisoner guilty; but he tells them this— “now the question before you will be, whether upon this whole matter you do believe —not that lord Russell had raised insurrection and rebellion against the king, but “ whether you do believe my lord Russell had any design upon the king’s life, to destroy the king, or take away his life ;"—that is the charge which my lord chief justice Pemberton gives to the jury who tried lord Russell, and no man ever complained that the trial of lord Russell was not sufficiently severe— that (he says) is the material part here, itis used and given you by the king’s counsel as an evidence of this, that he did conspire to raise an insurrection, and to cause a rising of the people to make as it were, a rebellion within the nation, and to surprise the king's guards, which, say they, can have no other end but to seize and destroy the king. So that lord chief justice Pemberton puts it to the jury, that though they believed these facts, yet from these facts they were to collect whether the prisoner had, or had not, a design upon the king's life, for if he had not, they could not find him guilty; if that had not been his opinion of the law upon this subject, he would not have put it to them to say whether lord Russell by this means meant to accomplish the king's death, but would have put it—do you believe he conspired to raise an insurrection and rebellion against the person of the king? if you believe that, you believe enough ; he does not say that—says they put this to vou as an evidence that he meant to seize and destroy the kin; and he goes on to say—“ it is a great evidence 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11573 but it is only an evidence—(“ if my lord Russell did design to seize the king’s gears, and make an insurrection in the kingom) of a design to surprise the king’s person. It must be left to you upon the whole matter—you have not evidence in this case, as there was in the other matter that was tried in the morning, or yesterday, against the conspirators to kill the king at the Rye. 
GIBBS 11574 Gentlemen, I should tell you that either on that same morning, or the day before, some other prisoners had been tried for being accomplices in the Rye-house plot, and a part of that plot was not only to raise an insurrection against the king, but to seize his person, and murder him; therefore lord chief justice Pemberton says—“ you have not evidence in this case, as there was in the other matter that was tried in the morning: or yesterday, against the conspirators to kill the king at the Rye. There was a direct evidence of a consult to kill the king; that is not given you in this case; this 1s an act of contriving a rebellion, and an insurrection within the kingdom, to seize his guards, which is urged as an evidence, and surely is in itself an evidence to seize and destroy the king. So that lord chief justice Pemberton puts it to the jury that these facts are strong evidence of that which they are to inquire into, namely, a compassing the king’s death, but he puts it to them as the evidence, and distinguishes the case from the cases in the morning, where the design was, to seize and destroy the king. Where is the need of that distinction, if con as is now contended by the counsel for the crown, conclusively and directly treason in itself? He goes on to say, “ upon this whole matter this is left to you; if you believe the prisoner at the bar to have conspired the death of the king, and in order to that to have had those consults that those witnesses speak of, then you must find him guilty of this treason that is laid to his charge,—that is, if you find that he conspired the death of the king ; but unless you draw that conclusion from the other evidence in the cause, you cannot find him guilty; this is lord chief justice Pemberton’s summing up to the jury; and yet he is complained of by the friends of lord Russell, as having dealt too hardly with him ; therefore I think it cannot be imputed to him that he did this in any favour to the prisoner—he states the point for the jury to be, whether they think that the prisuner conspired to put the king to death. J admit that under many circumstances, a jury ought to draw that con they will draw that conclusion, or not. I think upon much consideration of the question, not only that the existence of the overt-act is for the jury, but that it is also for them to find whether the overt-act was committed in the prosecution of that design upon the king’s life, which must be stated in the indictment; not only does this appear to be the opinion of lord chief justice Pemberton, but of sir George Treby, who was then recorder of London, and who afterwards was lord chief justice of the Common Pleas. Lord Russell was found guilty—the jury did find from the facts laid before them, from his conspiring to raise an insurrection against theperson ef the king, and more than that from is design to scize those very guards that are appointed for the protection of the king’s erson, that he did conspire the death of the ing, and I cannot say it was an unreasonable conclusion. You shall hear whether this is an inaccurate expression of lord chief justice Pemberton’s, or whether it was generally considered then as the law. Lord Russell afterwards, when he was brought up for judgment, desires to have the indictment read to him, When he hears the charge against him of compassing and conspiring the king’s death he starts—he says, “ hold, I thought I had not been charged in the indictment of compassing and conspiring the death of the king. The attorney general says, “ yes, my lord, you are. Then he says to the recorder— ‘T appeal to you and the Court, even if all the witnesses have sworn be true, whether I am guilty within the statute of Edward 3d, there aving been an evidence of a conspiracy to levy war, but no evidence of an intention to kill the king; and therefore I think truly jndgment ought not to pass upon me for conspiring the death of the king, of which there was no proof by any one witness. That is only lord Russell’s argument—how is he answered by sir George Treby ? he does not say, what you state to have been sworn to by some of the witnesses is treason, but he says— that was an exception proper (and as I think you did make it) before the verdict, whether the evidence does amount to prove the charge; that is proper to be observed to the jury ;’—Sir George Treby then agrees with the chief justice, that it was for the jury to determine whether the evidence of conspiring to raise an insurrection and rebellion in the kingdom, and to seize the king's guard, does or does not prove a compassing of the king’s death; he admits that it is not treason in law, but it may be evidence of compassing the king's death, if the jury think proper to drawthat conclusion. He goes on—“ for if the evidence comes short of the indictment, they cannot find it to bea true charge, but when the jury has found it, their verdict does pass for the truth, we are bound by the verdict as well as your lordship. We are to go by what the jury have found, not by the eidence that was laid before them. 
GIBBS 11575 So, you see, itis plain, in this case fror the direction given by lord chief justice Peaberton, in summing up; and from the tex pitulation of that summing up, if I may soa! It, by sir George Treby, when lord Ruse: was brought up for judgment, that the po: for the jury is, whether the overt act, lad & the subsequent part of the indictment, prove the treason laid in the furmer part of their dictment, namely, the compassing the king: death. I never will stand up to contend t: there are not many acts of this sort stated in my lord Russeil’s case, from which an hoes!jury ought always to find that the prisdid compass the king’s death. I think theewas in that case, supposing the fact tok proved that he meant to raise insurrection ad rebellion in the state inst the king. axthat he meant to seize t ards of the king, I think that was strong evidence to go to jury, that his attempt aimed at the kgs life, and I cannot blame thesa fer finding t verdict that they did; yet still it was wb them. 
GIBBS 11576 Gentlemen, having stated what I comer to be the law upon this subject, and ansfrom that what the points are for your con deration, I will state to you now the cha which has been attempted in evidence, 10 brought against the prisoner ; 1 have stated it before, but in order to render myself inte ligible, I will shortly repeat it—it is, “ tha he conspired to procure a convention, wld convention, when met, was to overtum tte government, to depose the king, and to pal him to death. To a certain point we st agreed—we agree that he did hold consult j tions for the purpose of calling a conve tion—the point upon which we differ ispurpose for which that convention was tobe called ; and it is for my learned friends lo are of counsel for the crown, before they abring this charge home upon the prisoneraprove one or other of these two things, eliethat a convention cannot be called for wy other but treasonable purposes, or to prt. in fact, that this convention was called & the purpose of procuring the deposition of Ueking, and thereby his death : they must pro one or other of these two things. Now trfirst it is impossible to prove—to assert thats convention, or meeting of delegates from dt ferent sets of people, cannot be called ther but for treasonable purposes, would absurd, and ne such thing can pass from tt mouth of either of my friends. You ae heard of many, many conventions that bvbeen called; there were two conventionScotland, they were not proved indeed, witnesses did speak of them, and thet ad when the jury has found it, their verdict doesity was never puesto pass for the truth—we are bound by the ver
EYRE 11577 Is it very fair to allude to them? 
GIBBS 11578 I allude to them merely as showing that conventions may be called for lawful purposes. 
GIBBS 11579 Then the next thing to be considered is, whether the attorney general has proved that this convention was called for that specific unlawful purpose which he has stated, namely, to depose the king (for that is the gist of the cause) and thereby to compass his death— they undertake to prove this; we, on the other hand, say, that the convention was meant to be called for lawful purposes; we say that the prisoner at the bar, and those with whom he acted, believed that corruption had found its way into the state, and was making large strides in it; that he believed this corruption was occasioned, encreased, and continued by the long duration of parliaments, and by the unequal representation of the people in the House of Commons; that if these defects could be reformed, all would be well ; he knew, and they knew, thata petition to parliament would not produce the end which they wished to procure, because matty of their petitions had been, I may almost say contumeliously, rejected ; they thought, therefore, that it lay upon them, as g citizens, to find some other means by which they might effect what they conceived to bea lawful purpose; and they believed that if the general opinion of the people was for this reform, and if that general opinion could be made known to parliament, that parliament, though it had rejected the separate petitions of individuals, would yet attend to the general opinion properly conveyed to them; they saw no other way of conveying this opinion to parliament, but by calling together a convention of delegates sent from different parts of the country, by the voice of which delegates they might first collect whether this was, or was not, the general wish of the people, and if it was so, that they might by the same voice communicate this general wish to parliament. This they professed, and there can be no doubt that this the language of their resolutions imports. 
GIBBS 11580 On the other hand, the gentlemen who are of counsel for the crown say that all this was mere pretext—you did not think that there was corruption in the state; you did not think that that corruption arose from the unequal representation of the people in the House of Commons, and the long duration of parliament; you did not think that this reform, which you speak of, would produce a remedy—you had other views, and we take upon ourselves to prove that you had them. Certainly it does lie upon them to prove these other purposes ; and as the language of our resolutions imports that our intentions were innocent, unless they can show from positive and direct proof, from that plain, direct, and manifest evidence which lord Coke says is necessary in all cases of treason, that the prisoner, and those with whom he was concerned, did endeavour to bring about a revolution in by means of this convention, it is impossible that you can find him guilty of the charge that is now brought against him. 
GIBBS 11581 Gentlemen, there are two parts of the proposition which, in point of fact, the counsel for the crown feel it necessary to make out. In the first place, they say we will prove there was a general plot in the kingdom for effecting this purpose, that is for effecting the deposition of the king. In the next place, we will prove that the prisoner, with others, was an actor in this plot, and is implicated in the crime in which they are all implicated. Now you will recollect that for the sake of making out that first part of their proposition, which brings no guilt to the mind of the prisoner— which shows no intention of his to bring about that which is imputed to the others ; they have not only called many members of all these societies, but have proved every thing that ever was done or declared by any member either of the Constitutional Society, the Corresponding Society, or any members of any other society that ever corresponded with either of these societies ; that they say is for the purpore of proving the general plot. This would not be evidence as against the prisoner individually, but this it is necessary for them to go through, in order to make out the first part of their proposition, that there did really exist a general plot in the kingdom, for the purpose of deposing the king, and afterwards they endeavour to show you that the prisoner was concerned in that plot; this you see does not touch the prisoner, without proot thathe was concerned in what they call the general plot. 
GIBBS 11582 Now, gentlemen, this certainly does lay us under considerable hardships. I told you before, and I am sure you will afterwards hear from his lordship that nothing of this species of evidence, which is not brought home personally to the prisoner, ought to affect him personally; that it goes only to prove the existence of a plot, and yet how difficult is it for us who stand as counsel for the prisoner ; how difficult for you who are the arbiters of his fate; how difficult for the Court, who yet will do it better than either of us can, to distingnish the separate parts of this evidence, to say what tends only to prove the general plot, and what to affect the prisoner personally ! 
GIBBS 11583 The difficulty upon us is insuperable, not from the nature of the thing, but from the extentof the evidence into which we were carried ; for I declare that, with all the diligence which I have been able to use, and with all the time which the indulgence of the Court has granted me, I feel it utterly impossible, in my own mind, to separate them, and, therefore, it is impossible for me to state where the line of distinction lies. If my learned friends, who conducted the prosecution, had first finished their gencral evidence, and had then gone to that which was to bring it home to the prisoner, we might to 3 certain degree have been able to distinguish the state, and hurl the king from his throneit, but as the case is they have jumbled alt and opinion of many people wiser than he (I would not have used these expressions if the noble duke had not left the courty—it does, I say, appear to me folly, but then when these opinions are thus promulgated, that which is folly may reasonably be supposed to find its way into the mind of a shoe-maker. 
GIBBS 11584 Another topic which was urged upon the prisoner strongly, in the opening, was, that French terms were continually used in the resolutions; and therefore it was supposed that Mr. Hardy and those with whom he acted, wished to introduce into this country, all that anarchy which had been produced in France, by those who use the same terms
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11585 Ileave you to judge how material that observation is against the prisoner, when I state to you, that we, meaning to have proved the origin of one of these terms, in order to show tit was not derived from the French, were told that the evidence was inadmissible; that it signified nothing to the cause, whether it was derived from the French, or the Scots, because it was no part of your business to collect, from words, whether the prisoner is guilty, o not, of a fact charged upon him; theretore you may dismiss from your minds all observation upon the use of terms, when we were ready to prove, that a term they call a French one is an English one. 
EYRE 11586 If you meanany thing that fell from the Court to that effect, rather think you misunderstood the Court. 
GIBBS 11587 My argument upon that subject was couched in a word, I said, we offer this evidence to show that a convention kid held in Scotland, before the time we heldthis. 
EYRE 11588 There was nothing said of those terms that I am aware of. 
GIBBS 11589 No; that is my reasoning upoe the subject. 
EYRE 11590 Nor was it stated that these terms were used in that convention. 
GIBBS 11591 We meant to show, that the term “ Convention, which they insist to be of French origin, is not so. gentlemen, I submit to you, that my argument upon this subject is a fair one, and a conclusive one; either the use of French terms is or is not material in this case, and is, or is not to be argued upon
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11592 If it is to be argued in this case, that we approved of French principles, because we have used French terms, then I insist, that it is competent to me to show, that a term which we have used, and which they have said to be French, is English, or is Scotch, because thereby I get rid of the pre sure of that term,—If on the other hand, it be not open to me to show, that terms which are used by the prisoner, and those with whom he acted, and that are said to be French, are English or are Scotch, then I am sure it cannot be open to gentlemen, on the other side, to contend, that we are to be supposed, by the use of French terms, to have adopted French idess, together, sometimes a fee of evidenee is offered to the general plot, then something that affects the prisoner succeeds it; sometimes a man from Sheffield, sometimes a man from one society, sometimes from another, sometimes a letter produced from one of the societies, sometimes from another, and sometimes from a third. I findit utterly impossible, in my own mind, so to separate them as to lay before, you any plain line of distinction which you could safely pursue. I must content myself, therefore, with stating generall what appears to me the tendency of the evidence by which they have endeavoured to show that there existed this general plot, and also that the prisoner was concerned in it. In the firstplace numberless papers havebeen roduced to you, in which you find very vioent and very improper expressions and resolutions. I admit that they are highly reprehensible; it is not for me to say whether they are, or are not criminal, because it is not my duty at present to contend whether they fall under any crime but that of high treason ; but it is the duty of my learned friends to point out that any of these resolutions, picked from the monstrous chaos of papers, that they have produced on this occasion, amount to an act of high treason. The point you have to try in this case, is whether they amount to an act which had for its object to depose the King, and thereby to destroy him. That the expressions are improper, neither my learned friend nor I ever would deny; certainly they are highly so—no man of sense—no man of reason—no man of decency would stand up to defend all these resolutions, or to defend expressions that are to be found in many of the papers, but they are not high treason, and that is the question that you have to try; they may show an indecent and irritated disposition in the minds of those who wrote them; but they do not bring home to the prisoner that guilt of which he is now accused, that of conspiring with others to subvert the state and depose the king, and thereby to effect his death. 
GIBBS 11593 If we are to consider these papers, let us take them all; let that which makes for the prisoner be taken, as well as that which Makes against him; the counsel for the crown say that the prisoner had no intention to bring about annual parliaments and universal suffrage, that it is alla pretence. 
GIBBS 11594 Gentlemen, look at the papers which will be summed up by my lord, when the solicitor general has gone through his reply, and you will find them full of these declarations ; you will find the complaint is of the corruption of the present House of Commons; you will find that the cause of that complaint is always stated to be the partial representation of the people in that House ; you will find that the objects sought by the prisoner, and those with whom he acted, were annual parliaments and universal suffrage, folly I think, and I dare sey you think so,—but yet it is the expression 
GIBBS 11595  a i a ad because the effect of these two decisions would be this, that the counsel for the prosecution may argue against the prisoner, from certain facts, which the prisoner, though he knows them to be false, shall not be permitted to controvert. This cannot, surely be supported, and therefore all arguments arising from the use of French terms, must, as it appears to me be excluded from the cause. Another thing imputed to us is, that we approve the French Revolution
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11596 Certainly the prisoner at the bar, and certainly many of those with whom he acted, did highly aprome a a a re ove of the French Revolution; it was ikely that they should approve of the French Revolution, in its origin, because they were j Englishmen, and because they were Freemen, an because the original object of that revolution was, to give to Slaves the freedom which we enjoy here. What was more likely tocatch the ear, to catch the mind of an Englishman than that a nation, which had certainly been in a state of abject slavery for centurics past, was restored to that freedom to which they were entitled by nature? I know it will be urged against me, that, after that period was past (I speak of the origin of the French Revolution), after acts of enormity, of which no rational man can approve, had taken place in France, that they still approve generally of the French Revolution; but it was not these acts, but the revolution in general, to which their approbation went; and supposing that, under all the then existing circumstances in France, they had expressed a general approbation of the French Revolution, and the state of things, as they then existed in France, is it to be inferred from thence, that they wished the same thing to take place in England? Did the same necessity lie upon us as upon France? Were we an afflicted and oppressed people? Had we any reason to complain of an over-bearing Nobility, whose hts were inconsistent with the general rly of the people? Had we any reason to complain of the oppressions of the Crown or of the Royal family? Do you find, from the beginning to the end of the evidence, a single complaint of that sort? 
GIBBS 11597 You find, in many instances, they speak of the king, and the herelitars nobility of this country, as entitled to reverence and respect. —Was it so in France? Were the king and nobility of that country entitled to the reverence and respect of the subjects of France, as the king and nobility of this country are entitled to the reverence and respect of the people here
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11598 No; far otherwise; it is not therefore to be supposed, that, because these men approved of the revolution in France, they approved of the late acts of violence that have been committed upon the persons of severalof the nobility of that country: It is not to be presumed against the prisoner, that he means to overturn the government of this country and to bring about the destruction of the king, because, forsooth, perhaps, with ri a misunderstanding of the subject, he ha’ pa cag an approbation of the French Revolution even at a time when a more reasonable man would not have done it. 
GIBBS 11599 But more than that, wishes of union with France had been expressed
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11600  Why, gentlemen, what man is there, who, if it could be accomplished with safety to this country, would not wish for an union with France, rather than such a war as the present? This was their object, as it will appear when you hear the evidence summed up by his lordship, from what I remember of a letter, which contains some resolutions addressed from one societ to another—I believe the resolution for addressing the National Convention of France ; —the motive which actuated them is stated there to be, to prevent the calamities of war, Surely, gentlemen, we have seen enough of this war to conclude, that, if these calamities could have been prevented, it would have been wisdom to have prevented them. The prisoner may have judged ill upon that occasion ; those with whom he acted may have judged ill; the war may have been a just and necessary one; I have nothing to do with that; but still you must allow, that a contrary opinion might have been entertained; and if experience has shown that the war was calamitous, and there were circumstances existing, at that time, from which it might peasibly be foreseen, that it would be calamitous; if an opinion could possibly be entertained, from the then existing facts, that we might have kept out of the war, surely you will not say, that the prisoner is guilty of high treason for expressing a wish, that an union might take place with France, when he declares, that his reason for entertaining that wish was, that a war which has turned out to be calamitous, might be avoided. 
GIBBS 11601 The remarks which have been made on the Address to the National Convention are open to the same answer. 
GIBBS 11602 Then the insertion of Roland and Barrere’s speeches is attempted to be fixed upon Mr. Hardy ; and mark how wide he stands from it; there is a resolution, at a meeting of the society, that certain speeches in the French language, from a French newspaper, should be inserted in their books, and they never are inserted. 
GIBBS 11603 Do you think, that that shoemaker understands French? Do you think, that that shoemaker ever read the Moniteur? Can you believe that, at the time when that passed, he could have any idea of what were the contents of these speeches? — Not that I admit, by any means, that, if the fact were proved upon him; if he were the person who made that motion, that it proves any thing in this cause. What does it amount to? That he wished to have communicated to the members of this society, what the reasons were upon which those who were desirous of bringing about that calamitous event in France, acted; if he thought those reasons were convincing; if he thought they ought to be followed up by an execution of the design; though I should differ from him most unquestionably, yet I am far from thinking and i am sure you will be far from thinking, that it is to be inferred from thence, that he compassed the death of his own king. What has the state of France to do with England? What were the grounds of accusation against the king of France? A constitution had been received in the country, of which the king was a part; the accusation against the king was, that he had violated that constitution; perhaps he was in the same situation there, in which James the second was here. 
GIBBS 11604 I do not say that the prisoner might not be misguided; I do not say that those by whom he was advised, or with whom he acted, might Not have misled him ; but even if he had read the speeches himself, if he had himself entered the resolutions on the book in English, 1 do insist that it does not furnish a presumption that he compassed the death of the king of England. The circumstances of that nation and this are widely different—Thank God ! the king of England lives in the hearts of his subjects; there is nv accusation against him that he has violated the constitution of this country; he has by his public and private virtues deserved and acquived the affections of his subjects; so I think, so you all think, and so the prisoner thinks. And it would be Monstrous cruelty to impute to him a design against the life of the king of England, hecause, under certain circumstances, he wished to have published to a society of people, the reasons upon which certain persons in France thought it right to bring their king to a calamitous end. 
GIBBS 11605 Itis said, that the prisoner, and those with whom he acted, must have intended by assembling this convention to act with force against the government, because, forsooth, they had resolved that they would no longer Petition parliament. Now, it seems to me, that that resolution naturally preceded the calling together such a convention as I have stated the prisoncr intended to call, and as I insist he might legally call. If the petitions of individuals had obtained from parliament that which it was their object to obtain by calling this convention, then the calling the convention would be unnecessary; but it was because the petitions of separate individuals had been rejected, and because the prisoner, and those with whom he acted, thought that the voice of the people might be raised louder than by petitions of individuals, and that then it would be heard : it was for that reason that he meant to call this convention ; the object of the convention was, to petition parliament in a different form, and in a voice that was more likely to be heard by them, in a voice which, he supposed, would be that of the Majority of the people of England. 
GIBBS 11606 entlemen, you heard read to you that which I shall have occasion to state more at large hereafter: the protest of that great coo stitutional lawyer, lord Camden, together with thirty-two other peers, against the nega tive put upon a motion for a committee to quire into the expenditure of the pubic money
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11607 From thencethey might have learned that there is a great difference between a petition from separate individuals and the voice of the people speaking in associations ; and you will learn from thence likewise, that, in the opinion of lord Camden, such associations were legal; mark the words of this protest; —“And, however some may affect to be alarmed as if such associations tended to dis turb the peace, or encroach upon the dele gated power of the other House; we are periaded it has no other view but to collect we sense of the people, and to inform the whok body of the representatives what are the sen timents of the whole body of their constitucnts, in which respect their proceedings have been orderly, peaceable, and constitutional ; and ifit be asked, what farther is to be done if these petitions are rejected? the best answer is, thattbe case cannot be supposed; for, although, upon a few separate petitions it may be fuirly said, that the other House ought not to be decided by a part only of their constituents, yet it cannot be presumed they will act in defiance of the united wishes of the whole people, or indeed of any great and notorious majority. 
GIBBS 11608 Why then, gentlemen, alter private petr tions have been received and rejected, It & lawful for the people to associate tor ep pose of obtaining that which parliament alone can give to them; and such associations are, (I am using the language of lord Camden, as great a constitutional lawyer as ever lived) such associations are legal and constitutional; and this is a legal and constitutional method of collecting the voice of the people, and of carrying it to the ear of parliament. 
GIBBS 11609 The next general topic of argument that was insisted upon by the attorney general, and the head of evidence that he went into was, I think, the proceedings of Mr. Hardy, and those with whom he was concerned 0 the Scotch Convention. He began with the instructions that were given to the delegates, whom they sent to that convention, and tbe article which he relies on as showing that the prisoner is guilty of the charge brought against him, was the seventh, in which it is stated “ That it is the duty of the people to resist any act of parliament repugnant to the original principles of the constitution, as would be every attempt to prohibit associa tions for the purpose of reform. 
GIBBS 11610 T certainly disagree with him in tbat; I certainly think that that was an improper resolution, but it is not an act of high treasoa; 
GIBBS 11611 suppose a particular act of parliament, o noxious to the public, is resisted ; suppose men tise in bodies to resist it; suppose they mise an insurrection in the country to resist it; that is high treason ; but conspiriag to rise an insurrection for the purpose of resisting such an actis not high treason
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11612 So the law is expressly stated by lord chief justice Holt in sir John Freind’s case, his words are “ If persons do assemble themselves and act with force in opposition to some law which they think inconvenient, and hope thereby to get it repealed, this is levying a war and treason, though purposing and designing it is not so,So when they endeavour in great numbers with force to make some reformation of their own heads, without pursuing the methods of the law, that is a levying war and treason, but the purposing and designing st is not so. 
GIBBS 11613 Why then, gentlemen, if conspiring to raise an insurrection against an existing law, and to resist the operation and execution of that law, be not high treason, a fortiori, a resolution, to Oppose, if it shall be passed, a law which at present has no existence, cannot be high treason. «The prisoner, Mr. Hardy, is a member of the London Corresponding Society; he and those who acted with him are only affected by the Scotch Convention, as far as that convention acted under their authority, or with their approbation; as faras thev acted under their authprity—they are not attected by any thing but this resolution. When the convention met they came to some resolutions which I do not find myself interested upon this occasion to detend any farther than this, that they certainly are not overt acts of high treason; to them the same answer applies as applies to this resolution; they do not amount to any conspiracy for the purpose of raising or levying a war against the king’s person; nothin likeit; and, therefore, though they are sack asa quiet and reasonable man would disapprove, yet they are not such as amount to the Crime of high treason. I beg you always, gentlemen, to hold it in your minds that the question you have to try is, whether the prisoner, and those persons, with whom he was concerned, meant to call this convention for the purpose of overturning the government, and thereby deposing and destroying the king. Now you will not find throughout the whole course of these proceedings any evidence testifying that intent; you will find strong language used in letters that are written, very strong, perhaps—strong resolutions, but none of them amount to a proof of the crime with which he is charged; nor does it appear to me, however criminal they were, that he ought to be charged with any of the acts of that convention; none of them were high treason undoubtedly. 
GIBBS 11614 But how do they endeavour to fix them upon Mr. Hardy and those with whom he acted? merely by showing that when irritated at the fate of their delegates, whom they had sent there, and at that which they were told, trom high authority, was a horrid and unjustifiable judgment against them, they passed some violent, 1 will say, indecent resolutions upon the subject. , 
GIBBS 11615 Something is due to the human mind in that state; you will not be extreme to mark what is amiss in a case of this sort; you will look to the intention, and see if any thing is proved against this prisoner, which can brin; home to his mind the criminal act charge: upon this indictment, and unless you find some one act which furnishes plain direct and manifest proof, in the words of lord Coke, of a conspiring to overturn the government and depose the king, you will cast out of your mind such expressions as I am alluding to, and you will find, however you may disapprove of his conduct in some respects, that he 1s not guilty of that high crime which is now imputed to him. 
GIBBS 11616 It is said (I think it is uot supportable in law) that these delegates who met in convention in Scotland were guilty of high treason, and that therefore Mr. Hardy, who was one of a suciety who sent delegates, and who might approve the proceedings that passed there, that he also is guilty of high treason. I cannot bring myself to believe that it was really thought that the proceedings of the convention in Scotland brought the crime of high treason home to those who assented to them here; because I cannot understand how the conspiring here to do that can be high treason which was not high treason in those who did the thing in Scotland. You know very well, gentlemen, that the delegates, who sat in that convention, were prosecuted ; but they were not prosecuted for high treason, but for a misdemeanor. ‘The lord justice Clerk had the’same evidence befure him on that subject that you have now; ifit had been hightreason heywould have done that which it was his duty to do; he would not have tried the prisoners for a misdemeanor—he would have told the jury, on the first trial, that they must find the prisoner not guilty of the misdemeanor, because his offence was of a greater magnitude ; and a person. must not be brought to trial for a misdemeanor when the facts amount to proof of a higher crime. WhatI say upon this subject is law, his lordship will tell you so, that if a man be indicted for a crime of a lower description, and upon the trial the evidence goes to prove that he was guilty of one of a higher description, he cannot in law be convicted of that crime of a lower description ; and therefore I have the authority of the court of justiciary in Scotland ; the authority of those who instituted and conducted those prosecutions for misdemeanor only, to say that the meeting of the Scotch Convention, the acts of the delegates (1 am not speaking of Downie and Watt, they were not connected with them) were not high treason, and, therefore, the conspiring here to bring about these acts could not be so. ‘ 
GIBBS 11617 Gentlemen, these appear to me to be the general observations arising out of the mass of evidence, with which we are loaded in this cause, and from which the counsel for the crown would persuade you to believe, that the risoner, and those with whom he acted, have een guilty of high treason. I come now to the parol evidence, and I beg again and again to bring to your recollection that the question upon this part of the case is, whether the prisoner in conspiring to call together this convention meant to depose the king : I come now to that parol evidence by which the crown has endeavoured to su port this position, that the direct object of all these societies was, to drive the king from his throne, and thereby to compass his death. 
GIBBS 11618 The first two witnesses whom they called upon this subject were, two men from Sheffield, Camage and Broomhead; they are witnesses for the crown, and therefore their evidence is unimpeachable as far as it makes for us most certainly. They are called to prove that preparations were made to support measures of violence by which this convention was to carry its projects into execution; for you know, gentlemen, to suppose that a convention was to be called that were to act with force against the whole body of the government, and to depose the king, and notto show that that convention was furnished with something like adequate means to effect that intention, would be absurd and nonsensical. 
GIBBS 11619 They found it incumbent upon them, therefore, to lay before you pat that the prisoner, and those with whom he acted, had prepared means for supporting this convention by force against the whole armed body of the government. For this purpose they call Camage and Broomhead, and certainly they both do prove some of the facts, at least, which the crown called them to prove; they proved that some pikes were prepared at Sheffield : I admit it—but how does the fact come eut upon their cross-examination? What was the purpose for which these pikes were prepared? Watch the account that the witnesses for the crown who were called before you to tell you all the truth, and whose evidence you TMust attend to, as far as it makes for the prisoner, as well as against him, and must give equal credit to it,—see the reason they give for making these pikes ; they say they were made by aparty to whom they, the witnesses, belong, because they had ground, just and reasonable ground to apprehend that they should themselves be attacked by the opposite party. Broomhead had been beset in his house; inflammatory hand-bills had been sent abroad; a gun had been fired under the door of one of their houses, and that gun had been fired by a member of an armed body, who were of political sentiments opposite to the society. Then what becomes of the line of evidence which is directed by the crown to this object; namely, to show that the prisoner, and those who acted with him, had been conspiring with the people at Sheffield to procure pikes for the purpose of supporting this convention, when it should te called against the whole power of the ment of this country? They had prepared ikes, but their own witnesses tell you why they prepared them; they had prepared themte cause their persons their houses, and their ives were not safe; they had actually been attacked, their houses assailed, and inflammatory han bills had been circulated round the town, 2 viting people to attack them by force, and ther thought they might legally do that which they will never be toldthey may not legally do, tht when attacked they may repel force by force, and may make preparation for such resistance, if they have reason to expect an attack. 
GIBBS 11620 The late history of this country shows hew necessary this measure was, and some inst ces which I shall state, show to how purposes such force may be applied. We bare not forgotten the calamities of doctorPriestiey, at Birmingham; we know that there a mb, because they happened to differ from him ad some friends of fs in political opinions, beet his house, and rased it to the id; woold it not have been lawful for doctor Priestky upon that occasion, to have opposed that fore, and to have prepared for it, if he had forewea it? Then was it not lawful for these peopk, when they had notice from the opposite party that they should be attacked; when they bad actually in some instances been attacked; when inflammatory hand-bills had bea sent round the town for the purpose of aciting people to attack them, was it tha unlawful in them to prepare the means of de fence against such an attack? and how is the preparation made by them of these arms fr their defence to be construed into an act of high treason in Mr. Hardy, because, truly, Mr. Hardy laine member of the Comes ponding Society here, has corresponded wih a ieabe of the Sheffield Society, of whrh society these men who had so provided for the defence of their persons and houses, wet members. This is coming at treason, not by plain, direct, and manifest proofs ; not evenby that by which lord Coke says it oughtnot tote come at, by inferences, butcoming at itby fake and unfounded reasoning; it isassigning too cause what the evidence ascribes to another; it is attributing to these people a design whit they certainly had not, and which the w nesses who proved the fact of their having the pikes state they had not, thereby to implicate ina supposed lesign, which was never enletained by these men, the prisoner, who hid no sort of connexion with them. 
GIBBS 11621 Not only doctor Priestley was attacked Birmingham, but Mr. Walkerand other pe sons were attacked in the same manne t Manchester. We know also that Mr. Dent son, at Nottingham was so attacked, buthiring notice of it before-hand, he did pnvie himself with arms to defend himself sist that attack ; he used those arms, be was he the place, and two of the rioters who attacked his house fell, and the inquest upon that death found it justifiable homicide. What would have been the fate of Mr. Dennison, if he had not prepared himself with those means of defence 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11622 his house would have been rased te the ground, as doctor Priestley’s was, and another disgrace would have fallen upon this country, by the destruction of the property of an innocent man, because he had not the means of defending himself against an illegal attack. 
GIBBS 11623 These instances show not only the neccssity, but the legality of providing arms against such attacks, when we are furnished with means of foreseeing them. But, gentlemen, not only do they take off all effect from that fact which was proved on the part of the crown, that pikes had been provided at Sheffield, but they prove something more. You observe that all the members of the Constitutional and London Corresponding Societies, and the Societies at Sheftield are endeavoured to be implicated in a general plot to calla convention for the purpose of deposing the king, and upon that ground the declarations and acts of all those people are received in evidence against us; we have a right then to ask them, when any of them are called here, what their views were ; if their views were to calla convention for the purpose of deposing the king, so far the plot is proved. Then what do the witnesses say? Camage and Broomhead are called by the crown, they say they had no idea of attacking the King, or the House of Lords; they had no idea of any thing but calling a convention which might make known to the House of Commons what was the pois opinion of the people; they had no idea of effecting the views of the convention by force, but only by the progress of reason; they meant to collect what was the general opinion of the people of the country, and if it should turn out to be the general opinion that this reform of parliament ought to be effected, then they believed, and I believe too, that the House of Commons would listen to that opinion so signified to them. 
GIBBS 11624 Another witness whom they called is Widdison. He comes from the same place, and you will recollect here that there had been given in evidence a letter from one Davison of Sheflield, to Mr. Hardy, stating what was true, that the patriots at Sheffield had provided themselves with pikes for their defence ; it is insisted that this defence was alla pretext, but when you come to hear the witnesses for the crown you see that it was not a pretext, that there was real danger of an attack. This Davison writes to Mr. Hardy, informing him that the patriotshad provided themselves with pikes for their defence, and telling him where their friends in London might supply themselves with pikes, if they thought proper, for the same purpose. It is imputed to Mr. Hardy the receiving this letter shows that he meant to provide this convention, or those who vere Ae act ame the opaxenten, with arms for the purpose of supporti! ir pretensions by force. It tent out that this letter contains another letter, to Norwich, which Mr. Hardy was desired to forward; both the letter to Mr. Hardy, and the letter for Norwich, remained in Mr. Hardy’s ssion from April 26th to the 12th of May, when they were seized ; he does not send that letter to Norwich, and he never mentions to his division that he had received such a letter; he never proposes to any of them to furnish themselves with arms. What then isthe fair conclusion to be drawn from these facts? You were in danger at Sheffield, and you provided yourselves with pikes there, and you did right In doing so; but we do not yet feel there is the same danger in London; we do not believe that we shall be attacked ; therefore Mr. Hardy takes no notice of this communication; he does not send the letter to Norwich, Nor state it to his division, or to any of his friends in London, except in the instance I shall mention presently. I say he took no step upon it, because he is desired to address any answer to one Moody at Sheffield, who is afterwards called asa witness by the crown, and who swore positively that no letter from Mr. Hardy, or any of the society, ever came to his hands; a conclusive proof that nothing was done by Mr. Hardy, or any of his society, at least with his knowledge, upon that letter, and it is, therefore, conclusive proof that he did not mean, upon a concert between him and Davison, to use these arms which were rovided at Sheffield for the protection and lefence of that society, he did not mean to use them against the government of the country. 
GIBBS 11625 Widdison, who is called also to this fact of the pikes, is cross-examined by us as to the purposes of their institution; he and they all Join in telling you their object was only parliamentary reform, that they wished to obtain it by peaceable means; that they meant to call this convention, not in order that they might oppose the government forcibly, not in order that they might take upon themselves the functions of parliament, not that they might enforce their opinions by dint of arms, but merely that they might represent to the House of Commons, what was the opinion of the majority of the people. 
GIBBS 11626 Hill, another witness, also states the same things ; he proves they had the pikes, but he proves that they were provided for the same purpose. Then great reliance is placed upon the evidence of Edwards; it is said that Mr. Hardy did communicate this letter to Edwards, and furnished him with the means of getting these pikes. Now how did he communicate it to him
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11627 Edwards, a forward man, asks him (and it was publicly known that these people at Sheffield had been thus beset, and had provided themselves with these pikes; it was no secret); Edwards comes to 
GIBBS 11628 Hardy and asks him if he could give him the direction to a person who made the pikes at Sheffield; Hardy having this letter in his pocket, never having communicated it to a single soul (for, if be had, the prosecutors would have knownit, for they have had spies upon him for these three years), being asked by Edwards for a direction to a man at Sheffield, he does give him that direction, and that is the only use Hardy ever makes of the letter he received from Shetteld, and he makes no use whatever of the inclosure to Norwich; Hardy did not want any of these pikes— how came Edwards to ask for them? Not from any communication he had with Hardy; he is the crown’s witness, and what he says on one side must be believed, as well as what he says on the other; he had it, he says, for the purpose of defending himself, if illegally stat ba, He says great insults had been offered him, and it was for that purpose only that he desired a direction to this man. He made one for himself. Is Mr. Hardy answerable for all his acts? And if he were, what does this amount to? Entertaining, perhaps, a fulse idea of a danger that threatens him, he chose to provide himself with a pike, and to advise two or three other persons to do the same thing. Is this evidence that can convince any reasonable mind, or can go a Step towards convincing a man of common Teason that these pikes were procured by Mr. Hardy, and those he acted with, for the puspose of supporting this convention which was to be called, for the purpose of resisting by force the whole united military of this kingdom, and all the armed associations whic have been raised in the country 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11629  Three doren pikes in the hands of a few Sheffield men, and in the hands of a few others into whose hands Mr. Hardy might have put sixty muskets and three French case knives, against the whole army of England! Now is that credible? Can you give ear to such a story? You observe this convention was to be called peat soon: Can you believe that men who ly entertained in their minds an idea of enforcing by dint of arms the acts of this convention which was just about to be called, would have taken no farther steps for providing themselves with the means of supporting them, than three dozen of pikes, an order only I think for sixty muskets, and less than half a dozen of French case knives? Gentlemen, my learned friend suggests to me a fact that fell trom a witness to-day when I was not in court, and I am very much obliged to him for it, as certainly it strengthens my observation extremely; he informs me that a witness being asked how many pikes they could have procured in Sheffield (if they had wanted them) in the course of one day, tells you that they could have procured ten thousand. Why then, gentlemen, it is no excuse that though their wants might be large, the means of providing them were not sutlicienuy large; they had nothing to do but to signify what they wanted, and if they hed meant to support this convention by force ia Shetheld, in the must disaffected plece, as my learned triend says, that existed in the coum try, they might have raised an army of pase men; that is, supposing they had numbes sufficient, into whose hands they might tar put them, they might have provided te thousand pikes in the course of a day; am yet this plan of arming for the support of tk convention, which is stated, I think, to tur commenced so early as the year 1792. whxb continued froin that time down to the 12h a May, 1794, this array preparing against te government of the country, though it mkt have been provided with ten thousand pices in the course of a day, had for its supp«t oo more than three dozen of pikes ; and I dom know whether it was an order, or only 2c versation, about an order, for sixty musket for the Lambeth Association, and three a four French knives. The absurdity and probability of the thing stares me in the face. 
GIBBS 11630 If these people had the will, they had me means; and you are to try whether ther ind the will; you are to try whether it was tle intention of these people to call this conve tion, and then to act themselves, through iis convention, by force of arms; now if yuu ind them making no preparation for this, if re find them not prepared to attack a sinzk company of guards, if it resisted them ; it becomes incredible that they should enternm any such project. In most cases of projected insurrection that we know from history, collect from the State Trials, there is either party in the country in arms to which the m surgents can immediately attach themselves, or else there are preparations for the levvze troops, which troops are to be collected, ead to be formed into a body at the time that th conspirators themselves are to rise ; but here there is a convention to meet immediatels, and yet no proof of that, without which thy indictment cannot stand fora moment, no prot of any levies on fcot, nor any preparations i raising that force with which it is pretemied the convention was to act. 
GIBBS 11631 Gentlemen, another witness whom the called is Samuel Williams, and he is to prove not only that Mr. Hardy had provided himet with pikes to enforce thedecrees of this cov vention, but also that he had embodied a fe of musketeers to serve under it. Now wht does that evidence amount to? 
GIBBS 11632 Mr. Samuel Williams, whois a gun engrave, and by that means connected with gun-smiths ordered a pair of shoes of Mr. Hardy at the end of the year 1793; he wished him to tek a gun(this doesnot move from Hardy original's. but he asked Hardy to take a gun of his’ Mr. Hardy is supposed to be a man who bad at this time in his minds plan for overturo7g the government by force, and for arming exber this convention itself, or arming an army act under this convention; they were not thee provided with arms; if Mr. Hardy had a tome in buying this gun, but he re such intention as this in his mind he would have caught at the proposal immediately ; this is a fair opportunity, as far as it goes, there can be no pretence to impute any thing uses to percha it; it remains with him a fortnight fore he can find a chap fur it: at the end of that fortnight the man coming again, and the purpose of supportin ordering a pair of boots, he has then got him a-customer. Now is that the conduct of a maa who had such a design in his mind as this indictment imputes to the prisoner? for he must have had it in his mind at this time, if at all, because they say that the conspiracy commenced before the delegates were sent to the Scotch Convention; yet if Mr. Hardy had in his mind the arming a troop for this convention, sarely he would have caught at the opportu.

Then Mr. Hardy is to be affected with the business of Mr. Franklow’s Lambeth Associalion, and Williams says that Mr. Hardy recom

Why itis notorious that Frank!ow had an association, he made no secret of it himself; those who belonged to his corps wore uniforms, he himself appeared publicly in this uniform at the dinner at the T know not whether the asso
GIBBS 11636 ; certainly it was an open and avowed association—probably Franklow, seeing the country full of armed associations, chose to have one ofhis own. Whether he had a right to do it, or not, I do not say, but it certainly is not an act of high treason. Seeing that other people, whom he thought no better affected than himself, had raised men, armed, and drilled them, it-was not unnatural that he should be desirous of doing the same, especially as he had been in the army before; a sort of esprit du corps 
GIBBS 11637 ‘that might belong to my learned friend. I 
GIBBS 11638 remember myself being in arms, and acting asa lieutenant under him (Mr. Erskine] at the time of the riots in the year 1780, and very proud we were of our arms, regimentals 
GIBBS 11639 ‘we had not, but very proud we were of: our muskets. I remember no orders from government to do this, no commission from the lord lieutenant; but as other people associated for the same purpose round us, we did it also; and Mr. Franklow instituted his association in the same way; it was a known public thing, there were printed orders and regulations, and he went publicly about in his uniform, To say that because that unfortunate man at the bar recommended Williams to furnish Franklow’s association with two or three guns, therefore he must be presumed, without farther proof, to have assisted m raising an armed body for the purpose of supporting this convention by force against’ the established government of the country, is the most alarming proposition I ever heard ina court of justice
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11640 If proofs like these are to implicate a man in the highest crimes, by what caution can innocence itself be secured against such a perversion of evidence? Merciful God! how do we expect that thou wilt look upon us at the great day of judgment if we thus scan the acts of our fellow-creatures here? Because a man happens in communication with another, who is his customer, to recommend him to provide a few muskets for persons who are raising an association, which might, or might not be legal, therefore itis to be inferred that he meant these guns to arm this convention, or their troops, for the purpose of waging war against the government; it is a monstrous conclusion, it would be too disgraceful a thing to insist upon, were it not that there are other circumstances, which I know the solicitor general will rely upon in his reply, and from which, taking them altogether (for no one of them, taken separately, furnishes any colour of argument), he wishes you to draw the conclusion whic! this indictment endeavours to affix upon the prisoner, namely, that he has compassed the king's death. 
GIBBS 11641 Gentlemen, the next witness whom they call is Gosling, and Mr. Gosling is one of that infamous set of men (for so surely I may call them) who, having no means of supporting themselves, endeavour to procure a Tivelihood by insinuating themselves into the secrets of others, and discovering them to the government; I do not say that men are not to be charged with acts of theirs discovered by spies, but I say that a man of this description, who gives evidence against persons into whose confidence he has endeavoured to insinuate himself, is to be heard and attended to with very great caution and reserve; his, value rises according to the importance of his testimony, he is a more or less valuable witness according as the acts which he communicates to his employers are more or less criminal; he is interested therefore to enhance them, and to that motive it is that I attribute a great deal of the testimony of Gosling. If a man of this description goes through his evidence fairly, without any objection arising upon the manner in which he gives his testimony ; if he relates to you a plain, regular, conekitent series of facts, I admit thatyou ought to attend to him. But recollect, gentlemen, how this man demeaned himself upon his cross-examination. In his examination in chief he was fluent, he was easy ;, he had all his facts ready, and he stated them all precisely ; but he sunk under my learned friend when he came to the cross-examina- , tion, he was confounded and abashed. I shall not pretend to go through the whole of his evidence, the day would not admit of it; but I remember he stated that one of those persons, whom they would have implicated in the guilt of the prisoncr, said he had been going about the country, to corrupt the soldiers, that he bad corrupted a considerable number of them, but he had found many who stood out againsthim. Now, if thathad been true, you would have had here all those soldiers who resisted him, as witnesses; there could be no difficulty in calling them, it was an easy thing for government to have collected who the men were whom this person had unsuccessfully attempted to tamper with, and their not being able to discover any of those men whom he had so unsuccessfully attempted to corrupt; there not heing called a single witness of that description to support the evidence given by Gosling upon that subject, is a plain proof to me that his evidence in that respect was not true; add to that observation upon his evidence, the manner in which he deported himself upon his cross-examination, the difficulty my learned friend had to get from him any answers to the plainest questions that he put, and I think you will have no doubt to say that what he swears unsupported by any other witnesses, speaking directly to the same facts, is not deserving of any credit in a cause Tike this. 
GIBBS 11642 Gentlemen, another witness of this description is Lynam, his evidence lasted five or six hours; itis utterly impossible for me to ge through it literally, but you recollect that he spoke from notes he had taken, in which he entered short memorandums; he had mistaken a great number of naines which he had entered in these notes, Curtis for Carter, &c. as far as they went they were full of mistakes, and there was hardly a single fact that hie spoke of which fixed any degree of criminality upon Mr. Hardy, or those with whom he was connected, that was found in his notes, but he related those facts from his memory ; if the notes of what he wrote down are so incorrect as to confound one name with another, what credit can you give to his recollection? He tells you that he did not attend to the particular persons who held the conversations of which he speaks, but that this, and that general conversation, passed at these meetlogs. gentlemen, I will tell you why he said this; it might have been dangerous to be more particular ; he might have been contradicted ; and any thing that had been said, by any of those people, he knew was ruled to be evidence of the general plot; consequently what he stated to have been said in general conversation, among them there was evidence.—Who told you this
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11643 Who are the people that used th sse expressions? From whom did you collect that? He does not know; he did not think it material to observe.—What! a spy; a man whose business it was to collect information for governMent; a man, who attended the meetings merely for the purpose of coming afterwards and giving evidence against these people. 
GIBBS 11644 Did not he think it material, at the time when he attended, to collect the names of those who suid this or that particular thing
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11645 Did he not know, that there was a great deal of difference in the degree of criminality, in those who said a thing, and those who were only present when it was said? Did not hs common sense tell himthat?— Oh! no! hepad noattention tothat; only that the conversatica did pass. To the memory of awitness, who gives you thisaccountofhisattention to such matens conversations as he pretends to describe, I think no credit is to be given.— Y ou will observe, whether the evidence he gives of any particular facts, is confirmed by other wanesses of a different description, and to whow testimony no objection lies; ifit is, you wil so far give credit to him, but otherwise joa will not. 
GIBBS 11646 There is another witness of the Lambeth Association brought forward to prove ths detestable plot, and that is Mr. Coates, Franklow’s apprentice. The account he gives of this Lambeth Association is, that it was public, that Franklow had a cartouch ber is true, but that cartouch box lay open, with others, upon the work board; he rez mentals, but we heard in evidence befure, that he appeared in them, publicly, at the Globe-tavern. 
GIBBS 11647 They come next, gentlemen, to the evidance of a Mr. Groves, aud I beg your partcular attention to him
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11648 Mr. Groves's evr dence had two objects; one was to show, that Mr. Hardy, in fartherance of the des za which is imputed to him, and for the sake of arming this convention, which was to act by force against the government, bad provided himself with French knives.—A nother object was to show, that, ata meeting, held on the second of May, at the Crown and Anchor, such language had been held, by persuns connected with Mr. Hardy, and the same society, as showed, demonstratively, that ther must mean to overturn the king, and his go vernment. 
GIBBS 11649 Now, in the first place, let us see how Groves, in his examination in chief, relates these facts. With respect to the knives, he tells you, that he was at Chalk Farm; that he was in a shed with about ten people; that five or six of them pulled out a little instrument, all exactly alike, which were French knives, and that Pearce was one of them; that somebody said, they were bread and cheese knives, and then a smile went round; that he asked, where they might be got; they said, at Green’s, in Orange-street, who was & perfumer and hair-dresser; he says, a week after he went to buy one; and then his ob:et is to show you, that Green had sold a great number of these kuives, for the purpose of arming this convention, or their army; aod that he had sold them in such a way as show, that he was sensible of the impzopnety of what he was about; he says, Greea uid him he had sold two or three hundred; be says, 4:¢ told me to speak very low, for the parlour door’ was open, and his wife wasa damn’d aristocrat. It is evident he meant, that it should be inferred from hence, that Green, who was one of this society, had plotted with Mr. Hardy, for arming this multitude that were to support this convention ; that he had contrived to procure these knives from Sheffield, for the purpose of arming them, and had alrcady collected a body of two or threc hundred, thus armed. 
GIBBS 11650 “ Another object that he had, was, to collect the sense of the society, from what passed at the meeting, on the 2nd of May, at the Crown and Anchor; and he tells you, that Mr. Horne Tooke was there, and it is out of his mouth that he collects this
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11651  Mr. Horne Tooke, he says, after dinner got up; he observed, that he supposed, one vut of fifty of the people who were there, might be considered as spies, and to them he wished particularly to address himself; the witness did therefore attend to what he said. Mr. Tooke desired the company to observe, that he was Not in a state of inebriation, for, having something to say to the company, he had refrained from his glass. He called the parliament a scoundrel sink of corruption; he called the opposition in parliamenta scoundrel sink of opposition ; he said, that there was a junction between these two scoundrel parties, formed for thepurpose of destroying the rights and liberties of the country ; he spoke about the hereditary nobility of the country; he asked, if that skip-jack, Jenkinson, could be considered as one of the hereditary nobility. He was asked, how Mr. Tooke had treated the Lords; he said, speaking metaphorically, for which his lordship, I remember, corrected him, that he had paid the Lords pretty much the same compliment that he had the House uf ComMmons; from thence he meant, to be sure, that it should be collected, that he had spoken of it as of the Commons; that is, that it was a sink of corruption, and ought to be purified. These are the two main facts of which he gives evidence. 
GIBBS 11652 Now see how this comes out in the course of the cross-examination. First, with respect to Mr. Tooke; you remember, that the question here is, whether the prisoner has conspired to call this Convention, for the purpose of deposing the king, and that this witness was examined for the purpose of proving, that language had been held indicative of an intention to overturn the government, and to depose the king; and that this Groves, in his examination in chief, stated to you, that Mr. Tooke had so spoken of the House of Commons, and of the House of Lords
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11653 How does it come out upon his cross-examination? T asked him, leading him as I might, he being a witness for the crown, whether Mr. Tooke had not said, that the hereditary nobility in the country, were a body ever to be respected? He said, yes, he had; he always had. I: asked him, whether his complaint had not been, that, by corruption, improper men were drafted out from the House of Commons into the House of Lords, by which the Lords were degraded. He said his complaint was, that the sending such men into the Ilouse of Lords was a disgrace to those who have hereditary seats there. I asked him then, whether he did not speak with high respect and regard, both of the office and person of the king? He said, yes; he always had; he spoke of this as trenching upon the authority of the king, and that he did not say one word disrespectful to majesty. 
GIBBS 11654 Then what does this evidence amount to P —See what is the question between us
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11655 We say, that the object of these men was mcrely a parliamentary reform; that they wished to bring about annual parliaments and universal suffrage; that their complaint was of corruption in the House of Commons; they thought a parliamentary reform would remedy the evil, and they meant to call a convention for that purpose. On the other side, they say, it was not for that purpose, but for the press of deposing the king; and they call a witness to prove, out of Mr. Tooke’s mouth, that that was his object. What does Mr. Tooke say? He says, that the evil lay inthe House of Commons ; so says the prisoner at the bar, and so he always has said; so all those that ever acted with him have said ; that it was the corruption in the House of Commons which had given birth to the evils he complained of, and that therefore the representation. in the House of Commons ought to be reformed. We say, that they never meditated any alteration in the House of Lords, or any attack upon the king; so says this witness, who is called to prove the contrary ; he swears that Mr. Tooke, whose language they are making use of against Mr. Hardy, always said, that the hereditary nobility of the country were a respectable body; that his complaint was, that members of the House of Commons, who did not deserve it, were removed into the House of Lords; that the king sires deserved respect; and yet this witness is called to prove, and that from Mr. Touke’s mouth, that the object of this convention was to dethrone the king. 
GIBBS 11656 Consider, gentlemen, how very strong this evidence is for us, when it comes out of the mouth of the prosecutor's witness. — We admit, that the object was to induce the Honse of Commons, hearing the general sense of the people, to reform the representation. This is the opinion of Mr. Tooke; this is the language which he held, and which he held in the presence of that spy. 
GIBBS 11657 These observations go completely, not only to put this evidence of Mr. Groves out of the case, as bearing upon this cause, but they go farther, in two respects. First, they go to show (and I am entitled to the full strength of that application of them) that the object, and the only object of these people, was a reform in the House of Commons; that a man, charged to be connected with them in this conspiracy, did, in their face, absolutely negative any design upon the king, or the House of Lords; that he confined his complaints to the House of Commons; that he spoke with respect of the person and of the office of the king, and yet this witness is called to prove, that they wished to drive the king out of his place in the constitution; he proves the direct contrary; he proves, that the object of all the people there assembled, spoken by the voice of Mr. Tooke (I say, that was the object of them all, because none contradicted him) was, to maintain the dignity of the House of Lords, and to maintain the person and dignity of the king. 
GIBBS 11658 Gentlemen, that is not the only use of the evidence of this man; it furnishes us with a fearful example, how much mischief may be done by the evidence of spies; we have no means of correcting their evidence; we know not what will be the course of it; we have no clue ta cross-examine them; and it was mere accident, that his testimony did not leave upon your minds the impression, that Mr. Tooke, in this large assembly, had declared himself against both the House of Commons, and the House of Lords; for he expressly said, at first, that he complimented the House of Lords in the same way that be did the House of Commons, and so we should have been fixed with this imputation, that, sitting at diuner with Mr. Tooke, and five hundred people, all of whom are attempted tobe connected in this plot, we countenanced a doctrine which was publicly broached in that assembly, that all the Lords and Commons were a sink of corruption, and, consequently, that an attack was levelled at them all ; what a situation then would my client have been in, from our not knowing how to examine the witness; from our not knowing how to lead him to the truth, which he kept back, and which he knew to be material, and which he ought, upon his oath, to have told upon his examination in chief; from our not having the clue to his cross-examination, that man at the bar might have been condemned to the extreme punishment of high treason, None but a spy so demeans himself 3 None but a dishonest man; none but a miscreant, like him, seeps back, in his examination in chief, all that he thinks will make for a prisoner, and delivers all that is against him. I am entitled to say he did so; and from thence entitled to caution you, how you credit the testimony of such witnesses, unless you find their evidence confirmed by other witNesses, speaking to the same fact. 
GIBBS 11659 Gentlemen, I have not done with Groves yet; he has beem guilty not only of a supPression of the truth, but he has been guilty of direct perjury; a perjury, committed by him, for the putpose of enhancing his own value with those by whom he is employed, at the price of that man’s life; a crime which, I am sorry to say, is not in law murder; that, however, was his object, and I will shew you it was his object. I observed, that another part of his evidence went to show, that Greea was a conspirator with the rest in this plet; that he had conspired to assist this convestion by force, and, in the prosecution of that conspiracy, had already sold two or three hundred knives, for the purpose of arming the conspirators. 
GIBBS 11660 Groves says, he went to Green's, for the purpose of purchasing one of those knives; that all was secrecy; Green told him “to spesk low, for the parlour door was open, and his wife was a damn’d aristocrat. Now the anly object that he could have in so representsg the thing was, to make you believe, tht Green sold these knives in private. Greenis afterwards called, as a witness for the crowa, and what is the account that he gives of this? Ile tells you, that, in the fair and ordingry course of trade, he had three dozen of these knives, and he had sold, I think, thirteeper fourteen, each to a different person; he hed them sent to him in packages, of six or seven in a package ; he says, he sent one yackagen Mr. Hardy, but that part does not apply to Groves’s evidence. 
GIBBS 11661 This evidence is, you see, inconsistent with the account that Groves gives ; this, however, may not affect Groves with perjury ; because, though this is the truth, Green may have given a different account to Groves. Withs view to ascertain that, he is asked, did you ever tell Groves you had sold two or thre hundred 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11662 O ! never! he asked, if the knives were a saleable commodity: I said they were. To be sure, every man will talk in that way of his own wares; there Groves is contradicted. Did you say any thing, testifying any apprehension about selling them? Nothing upon earth ; the knives, he says, hy in the show glass, open to the view of the public, a public article of sale ; and yet Groves tells you, that he sold to him, privately, and would not let even his wife know, that be sold one of these knives. But here we pia him to a direct fact. Groves says, in terms, that Green told him (Groves) that his wie was a damn’d aristocrat, and desired him net to speak so loud, because the parlour door was open. Now Green, a witness, who is likewie called by the crown, swore, most positively, not only that he did not use the expressions imputed to him by Groves, but also, that be neither mentioned his wife, nor made use of the word Aristocrat. Then here we have one of the crown’s witnesses, positively and directly contradicting another of the crown’s witnesses, as to a very material fact, slid in by Groves, that these knives were scld by Green, under an apprehension of fear, and in secrecy: it goes farther ; for, in stating that Green ssid is wife was a damn’d aristocrat, he meant you should infer that he, and those with whom he acted, were men of a contrary priuciple, apd men who meant improperly to use these knives. You see the turn be gives it, is endeavouring to disti between aristocrats, and those who had french knives; that his wife was not to see him sell these knives, because she was a damn’d aristocrat, meaning that Green would have it understood, that he sold these knives to persons of a contrary deseription, but would not have her know it, because she, being of different principles, would disapprove of it. With these observations I dismiss this witness ; he not only does not prove any thing that would be advantageous to the crown, but his evidence is material for the prisoner, and he furnishes you with a lesson, which, I hope, you will not forget, when you are to decide upon the evidence of persons of his description. 
GIBBS 11663 I have done with so much of Green’s evidence as relates to the contradiction to Groves. But there is another thing which Green, a witness for the crown, swears to, and which falls in with the rest of our evidence. He is asked, whether he, being a member of this society, and acting with them upon many occasions, whether he had any idea that this society, or any deputation from them, or any convention to which they sent delegates, was either to attack the person of the king, or to effectuate any of their opinions by force of arms? He tells you, in express terms, no, not aman of us, had any such object; our object was parliamentary reform; the means by which we were to effect that parliamentary reform, not being able to effect it by petitions, was, by a convention, to act peaceably. It was first to collect the opinion of the public, and then to represent it to parliament
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11664 We hoped and believed, that that would turn out tu be the public opinion, and that the public opinion, being so peaceably represented to parliament, would bave its due weight. 
GIBBS 11665 Then, gentlemen, after these witnesses, who go to the proof of what had passed in England, they endeavour to implicate us in the guilt of Watt, who has been lately executed for high treason, at Edinburgh, and for that purpose they call Mr. McEwan. There is no way by which at at all connect Hardy with Watt, except, I think, thata letter was sent by Hardy to Skirving, who was a member of a society to which Watt belonged; and in a conversation between Watt and Stock, at Eaiabiare, it appeared, that Watt was deSirous of sending a letter to Hardy, and communicated with Stock, how he might send that letter, without saying what it was about; but no such letter appears ever to have been sent; what the subject was upon which he Meant to correspond with him, does not appear; and yet it is in evidence to you, that the letters that were sent to Mr. Hardy, I cannot say, positively, that it appears in evidence that all were, but there is every reason to suppose, that all the letters which were sent to Mr. Hardy, upon this subject, were seized by the crown 3 so that, I think, you that he personally knew that any such man as Watt existed, and yet it is endeavoured to affect him, by what Watt did in Edinburgh, though none of the delegates who sat with Watt there, are attempted to be affected by it. 
GIBBS 11666 Who is this Mr. Watt? Why Watt was a spy, employed by government, up to a certain extent; he was discharged by them from that employment, I believe, because he over-valued his services; so it appeared, I understand, upon his own trial; being discharged by government, he continues to associate with the Scotch Convention, and he makes a violent proposal there, which all who were present reject; I do not mean that, in the convention, he made the proposal; but among some of the members, he made a proposal, which all who were present instantly rejected. 
GIBBS 11667 Now I will tell you what I firmly believe to have been the case. Watt had been a spy ; he had carried communications to government; he pretended, perhaps, to know more than he did; he over-valued the communications he did carry, and therefore was discarded ; he still fixed himself upon these men, who did not know that he bad been a spy, and kept company with him; and I do verily, in my conscience, believe, that he made this pespossl to them with a view to carry the information of it afterwards to government, and then to hang these men, if he could get them to agree with him. I believe that to be the case ; I believe him to have been a determined miscreant, and I am not sorry that he was hanged, if that were the case, because he justly deserved it; but having, as a spy, carried information to government; having required a higher price for his services than vernment thought he deserved, he had n discarded; he afterwards goes back, and makes this proposal, which was rejected withabhorrence by them, and I do verily believe he made this proposal for the sole purpose of implicating them in the guilt of such a project, that he might carry the information to vernment, and thereby show he was worthy of his hire; that he might show he was worth the price he asked, Now take it cither way; that te really meant to accomplish this roject, or that, not meaning to accomplish it, Es wished to draw other people into it, fur the sake of sending them to the gallows, he has met the fate he richly deserved. 
GIBBS 11668 But observe another thing. Watt is to be connected with Mr. Hardy. How? Through the Scotch Convention; because Mr. Hardy corresponded with the Scotch Convention, and because Watt was a member of that con. vention. Good God! have they attempted to fix this guilt upon any of the delegutes to the Scotch Convention, except those two individuals, Watt and Downie 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11669 Government has prosecuted all the indictments, E suppose, that they mean to prosecute tor high treason, in Scotland, and yet not one of these may fairly infer, that no such letter was sent;delegates with whom Watt was, at one time, there is no evidence in the cause to show, immediately connected, has been indicted for  
GIBBS 11670 bit treason
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11671 Why? because the high treason of which Watt was guilty, consisted of a fact, in which they had no participation, and much less had the prisoner any participation in it. Recollect what is the account McEwan gives, when this project was proposed to him by Watt. He says, that they rejected it with abhorrence. Then, if those who were upon the t rejected it with abhorrence ; if no immete communication upon the subject is proved between Watt and Hardy, will you, by a long chain of implication and inferences, fix that upon Mr. Hardy, which the officers of the crown do not pretend that they can fix upon those who were immediately connected with Watt, the actor in it? It is impossible to suppose, that men of common justice, and of common humanity, can entertain such a thought. 
GIBBS 11672 Another observation arises upon this evidence of Mr. McEwan; he is a Scotchman, and he was a member of the Scotch Convention, and you have heard from him what he thinks of the Scotch Convention, and I think You have reason to believe from the manner in which he gave his evidence that you receive from him his real sentiments upon all the subjects upon which he is questioned, and a true relation of all the facts to which he was examined; was there any difficulty in getting from him this account of Watt? Did not he immediately, upon being asked, communicate the whole story? Did not he express his own abhorrence of it? I believe he came voluntarily to give this account; I am sure the contrary does not appear in the cause, and Iam entitled, as counsel for the prisoner, to insist that no fact exists which is not proved. The witness came forward in the ordinary course, and therefore I am entitled to suppose, that coming forward in the ordinary course, he did it voluntarily, in order to state facts to “you, upon which you will have to reason when you come to consider what verdict you will give. When I say that no compulsory means were used to bring this witness to the bar, it is not because it is material to me whether it le so or not, yet still I am entitled to make that assumpticn. Now what is the account he gives of the whole of this business? and here I am answering that part of their case which endeavours to implicate us in the guilt of those persons at Edinburgh. He states that there was no idea of trenching on the authority of the King, or Lords; that there was no idea of assuming the functions of parliament; that nothing was to be done by force, and the very night on which they were dispersed, it appears, they had considered upon petitioning either the parliament, or the king: then, if that were the case, what becomes of the charge against the prisoner? If in all this vast field ot evidence, which they have taken, they cannot prove any design, hy means of this convention in Scotland, to depose the king by force, what becomes of the charge against Mr. Hardy, who was not directly implicated eva in what that convention really did? The charge against him is, that he conspired, wit: others, to call a convention, which convetion was to act by force of arms against tk povennitent of the country, and to depose the ing. Surely the proceedings at Edinbas furnish no proof of this sort against him. 
GIBBS 11673 I observe, and I dare say the fact will relied upon, by the solicitor general in reply, that all the witnesses who have been que tioned to these circumstances (their witnesses as well as ours) were asked by the atlomegeneral, whether they thought certain res tions that were shown to them were peacute and orderly? Some had seen them, sae had not. Now I have nothing to dowd their opinion upon the point, whether the resolutions were peaceable or orderly. Th question, in this cause, is not whether thez people had come to peaceable and orderly m solutions; but the question is whether ther have committed an overt act the direct obet of which was to depose the king, and te ultimate object of which was to bring abon his death; that is the question for your dete mination. And it is very hard upon the pr soner if dust is to be thrown inte the eyes the jury, by endeavouring to fix their attentka upon facts which do not amount to an art«l high treason (for if one act does not, all taken together cannot) for the sake of preventing them from looking directly to that which 3 alone the object of their inquiry, name, whether this prisoner did conspire, will others, to destroy the king, when they to call a convention? And it matters ot whether this report of the secret commiliee be full of obnoxious and offensive resolutions; it matters not whether they are guilty of the other crimes in the catalogue of crimizal law: the sole question is, whether they hie been guilty of high treason? whethet Hef meant to call this convention for the purpot of deposing the king? And when you every one of the witnesses for the whether they had any such intention; i they tell you in plain direct words that Uey had uo such intention; that their views peaceable, and that they meant only top duce a parliamentary reform, by calling convention ; you are not to be led away by9 accumulation of all these acts (offensive, Pe haps, but not one of them amounting overt act of treason) to find the prt guilty of so high a crime, because you 4 prove of his politics, or because you dist}Pt of some of his conduct. ‘Thank God! i not the way in which a prisoner is to be in this country !—You are to keep your the fact with which he is charged, 0 inquire whether he is guilty of ten thos misdemeanors; whether he is obnoxios. this or that set of men; whether his int are such as you or I should approves whether he has been guilty of the crime iE which he stands charged, namely, when his project of a convention was directed immediately to the deposition of the king, and ; to be guilty of High treason, and ultimately to bis death, and if you do not find that, you cannot find the prisoner eet Gentlemen, I have already observed upon the miserable case that is made on the subject of arms, muskets, and pikes, and I am perfectly persuaded that that part of this case -would never have been laid before you, if 2 those who conduct this prosecution had not entertained a firm and certain opinion that without it they could do nothing ; such evi. dence weakens a strong case ; it is of a nature to add nothing to the strength of a case that could stand by itself; but we know very well that in a certain stage of a cause, when it is found that’ there is not sufficient to fix that charge upon the prisoner, without fixing which there must be a verdict of acquittal, any thing is attempted. Hence, arose the attempt to fix Mr. Hardy with the acts of Watt; one’s Mind revolts at it, and I am sure it would ; Rever have been attempted, if it had not been thought necessary to the support of this cause, Gentlemen, I told you before I had the ; best authority for saying that the delegates in Scotland, none at least of them but Watt and Downie, had been guilty of high treason. I have the best authority for saying that, because Lhave the authority of diisae who prosecuted them for a misdemeanor, and of the judges before whom they were convicted of a misde; Meanor. If they were known to be guilty of high treason, and yet were prosecuted for misdemeanors, it was not humanity so to Prosecute them ; true humanity is to be shown tothe innocent, and not to the guilty; the guilty should be punished up to the extent of their crimes, but if these men were known to be guilty of high treason, and yet were prosecuted only for misdemeanors, that prosecution becomes a snare to others; it holds out to them that acts of this sort are not high treason, it waits for their going on perhaps till they have accomplished the act, and then the net is thrown over them; they are told, this was a trap laid for you, we knew that those others had been uty of high treason, but we thought if we punished them as traitors, you would not gu on ; you have gone on, and now you must take the consequence; it is nothing to you how we proceed against other men; we will proceed against you as the law is—we will proceed against you for high treason, although we proceeded against them only for misdemeanors. I say that is not true humanity ; those persons who had been guilty of high treason should have been punished as traitors, and a trap should not have been laid for those who at that time were innocent of it; humanity should have been shown to those who had not been then guilty of crimes, and not to those who had. Ido not say that this was the conduct either of the prosecutors of these delegates, or of the judges who tried them; but I ain entitled from their conduct to assert this, that they did not believe them that they prosecuted them only for misdemeanors, because they knew them to be guilty only of misdemeanors. 
GIBBS 11674 Gentlemen, I have stated to you the ground upon which this prosecution is founded ; it is compassing the king’s death. I have stated to you that which I beg you always to hold in your minds, that the foundation of this prosecution is, that the prisoner called this convention for the purpose of deposing the king. I have stated to you that none of those acts which are contained in the volume of written evidence that has been laid before you, amount to proof of that fact. I should have stated before, it was an omission that I did not, but: I will now state to you what I apprehend to be the overt act charged in the indictment, and relied upon in proof as fixing this crime upon the prisoner; it consists in the resolution for calling a convention; the crime imputed is, that he resolved to call it for the purpose of deposing the king. 
GIBBS 11675 Now I beg you to hear the language of that resolution, as it was ultimately agreed to— “ That it appears to this committee very desirable thata general meeting, or Convention of the Friends of Liberty should be called, for the purpose of taking into consideration the proper methods of obtaining a full and fair representation of the people, that is the overt act with which the prisoneris charged. Wh, then, gentlemen, ihe professed and avow object of this convention by those who resolved that it should be called, was, not that it should take arms into its hands, not that it should entertain others who had arms in their hands, but merely that it should take into its consideration the proper methods of obtaining a full and fair representation of the people. This is the language which they hold throughout all their resolutions, and I insist that there is no direct evidence on the part of the crown which shows that this is a mere pretext. I shall come presently to that part of the case, and to the grounds there are for saying this was not a pretext; at present I am only considering how the evidence for the crown have made out their case; upon this part of the case you must believe, before you convict the prisoner, not only that there was force prepared, but that it was his intention that this convention should use that force. 
GIBBS 11676 Now a very remarkable observation that arises in the case is, that there is nota sin; le tittle of evidence from the beginning to the end which unites the project of the convention with any thing of arms, that connects or brings them together at all; they had spies upon all their proceedings—all their meetings were watched over—every member of the society had, when in the society, and robably at many other times, a man at his elbow who: would give an account of every thing that assed, and yet there is not a single word that has tallen fromany of the witnesses ; nota single expression, I believe, to be found in all: the written evidence, that connects the calling of the convention with the preparation of any force ; unless you connect the two together, you cannot find the prisoner guilty upon this charge in the indictment; there is no proo' which can be stated to you, none that can be left to your consideration without the parol evidence that these men intended that the convention should act by force; throughout the written evidence they expressly disavow it. 
GIBBS 11677 You must believe men’s words, unless the direct contrary is proved; but when the crown has given in evidence this business of arms, they tell you, and I am entitled to assume it, that this is the force which those members of the convention meant to use; if there was any other they would show it, and’ the conclusion follows, that if they did not mean to use this force, they meant to use’ 
GIBBS 11678 none. The crown knew all they had done; the question is, whether the convention meant to use force; if the crown cannot prove they Meant to use this force, they do not prove they meant to use any; the case would have been more strong, perhaps, upon that part of it, if they had not called their witnesses, because then you would have been told that a great deal was to be left to fair presumption and inference : that though they had not proved it, yet you were to presume it from the other facts proved ; but they have taken upon themselves to show you what that force was which this convention was to use, and they put it upon the pikes, the muskets, and the knives. Thee we have pretty well disposed of them 
GIBBS 11679 But supposing there was any thing serious in this proof of the pikes, the muskets, and the knives, there is no evidence connecting it with the convention; and if it had been the project of these people, if it had ever entered into the minds of any of them that this force should be used by that convention which they intended to call, it is impossible that the crown should not have been able to have laid evidence of it before you. You see they have spies every where; you see when we call a witness, they know him better than we do; they have had a man in every society in London. They can ask when Mr. Stevens was called, whether it was Mr. Stevens of Rathbone- place, or Mr. Stevens of the Minories. They know them all, they have watched at their elbows, they have been vigilant, and they are to be commended for it; ie still it fortifies my observation, that they know all that is in this case; that nothing is left to presumption, to inference ; that all that exists as been brought forward by them, and that you have nothing to form your judgment: upen, except that which they have laid before you; they have laid before you, therefore, all which exists of arms; they have laid nothing before you to show-that these arms were connected in- any way with the convention: ‘Therefore, I bave-a right to assume that the lise fact does not exist, that it ever wae nik contemplation of these men that thee am: should be so used; because if that had bese their contemplation, these men who tk of what they mean, would hy enough f talked of this, and it would have le: 
GIBBS 11680 known to the officers of the crown. Hor ublic has every thing been done whit iss been done? There is hardly a single x: of theirs imputed to them as a crime; one out of that number and variety of tte acts which are all woven up in this isinar web that is now spread before you; not which the prisoner, and those with when acted, have not publiely avowed in the fe of day. It may be said that if the acts illegal, this adds to their illegality ; that te: are not only illegal, but they are impute but that does not make them high tres: and it shows that what. these men profes were really their objects ; it shows that the acted bond fide; it shows that they thot they were about that which they hed nst todo, and that is the way in which usetk argument ; it shows that though they mitt be wrong, that though they might be eos; illegally, they thought they were ectiog k. gally, or they never would have submitted the investigation of courts: of justice, thet acts which are now complained of as consti ting the crime of high treason. Gentlemen, hitherto I have only remattd upon the evidence that has been produce the part of the crown; you observe it app from the language of our resolutions eer they have produced against us, that our ject was parliamentary reform; that langnt they say may have been a mere pretest, i may have covered a different desiz0. ee have it upon oath that this and nothing was the object of those people with wi they say we are connected, for every witit whom they have called, and who keer objects of those people, has sworn pares objects were peaceable. This is the e on the part of the crown. th Now, gentlemen, we have confirm ss evidence of the crown by evidence of our we have added to the number of wiuew whom the crown have called, others wirgia an account of what were the motives of iy societies, what was their end, 3 what means by which they meant to - ue end; every one of those witnesses, a we after another, has agreed in saying ths end was: a parliamentary reform, 29 call th to accomplish that end they meant (0 convention, yet it itever entered into minds to conceive that this conventt na to act by force; on the contrary, that tte to act by all peaceable means, to wetel voice of the country, and whe a os means of that convention, it was to eth by the same organ to the House of who it was supposed would listen 0"it Gentlemen, it would be idle 2 pat would be cruel towards you, td go cularly into the evidence than is necessary. 1 think I have stated what is the general effect of the evidence of every witness we have called; but I think there are two who were called last—I mean Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Francis, who spoke more particularly to this fact, 
GIBBS 11681 ‘ and whose evidence will deserve more of your consideration, because they show most decidedly that the objects the prisoner has always professed, were his real objects. Gentlemen, you recollect the time when there was an alarm in the kingdom, when the militia was suddenly embodied, and parlia Tent was assembled. Parliament was assembled, indeed, for the purpose of embodying the militia, because without it the militia 
GIBBS 11682  could not be embodied in a legal way; the ground alleged for calling ther was, that there were disturbances and insurrections in the kingdom; there were some gentlemen who thought that there did not at that time exist those disturbances and insurrections which were stated, and accordingly an inquiry was instituted into the real existence of them; upon that occasion Mr. Hardy attended Mr. Sheridan, and Mr. Sheristates to you in terms that Mr. Hardy arliament togewished a committee to be appointed; he wished an inquiry to be made, and he was 
GIBBS 11683 Yeady, and was to have laid before Mr. Sheri" dan, nay he was to have been called before the House of Commons, and to give an account there of all he knew relative to that business; be state! that their societies did meet at public-houses; that publicans, bably thinking their licences would be taken away, would not permit them to meet in their houses any more; that they had accordingly met at private houses; that he (Mr. Hardy) had communicated a list of these houses, and hadl given Mr. Sheridan all the information in his power ; that he wished an inquiry might be instituted, in order to show to the iament and the public what their real’ iee was: that he was ready to lay before them all the papers, all the documents relative to the prveress of this society. This seems te me to furnish extremely strong proof that Mr. Hardy acted bund fide; that he had then no criminal intent in his mind, nor had any of those acting with him, because if they had, he would have withdrawn from such an inquiry ; instead of that he comes forward publicly, deSires that an inquiry into their conduct may be institued, and he gave every assistance in his power for that purpose. Eappeass from Mr. Francis’s evidence, that what Mr. Hardy says has always been his object, always was so; he and some other members of this society attended Mr. Francis, wishing him to pace a petition to parliament, for annual parliaments and universal suffrage. Mr. Francis says, Mr. Hardy struck him, particularly from his deies, as areasonable, quiet man. Mr. heridan likewise gave that testimony to his tex: he says he remarked him for his peaceable and decent deportment ; thet come ing to him to desire him to present this peti tion, he conversed with them upon the subject; and they said then, what they now sayy notwithstanding this sent prosecution against them, that they learned their principles from the duke of Richmond’s letter that they were convinced by his arguments ; and I am afraid that they still hold the same opinions. I hope it is no reflexion upon any. man, not to entertain these vpinions; for I do not myself; yet still it is surely am excuse to such a man as Mr. Hardy, that he, holds opinions such as the duke of Rich mond entertains, and not only entertains, but has given to the ae as his opinions, and acted upon himself. They adhered to their object, Mr. Francis says, of poiversak suffrage; he stated to them, that that wag net the usual form of a petition, and they had better leave it to the House, what sort of reform should be adopted. They still, Mr. Francis says, adhered to their object; but they were ready, if, according to the forms of the House, it was more respectful, to leave the whole to the wisdum of tha House of Commons, what means they should adopt; they were ready to pregent their Petition in the general form; but still they adhered to their principle, that what they wished for was universal suffrage. Surely this must show, beyond doubt, that these men really thought it would be good thing to obtain universal suffrage, and that this was the object, and the only object which they i , and bone fide pursued. 
GIBBS 11684 But, gentlemen, those who conduct this prosecution wish to persuade you that there’ 18 more in it tham lies upon the surface; that these men have not acted honestly; that they have not acted bond fide; that this which they have held out as their object, and this which they have held out as their means of obtaining that object, are a mere pretext, and that there is no colour for insisting thet they are their real opinions
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11685 Let us examine that a little; let us see what grounds they had for really entertaining these opinions, and whether their conduct be not such as leaves you reason to conclude they are their real opinions.—The proposition of these men is this : That the House of Commons is corrupt; that that corruption proceeds from the manner in which the people are represented in parliament, and from the’ long duration of parliaments; that they think thisevil might be corrected by annuak parliaments, and by universal suffrage; they think the House of Commons will not grant them this upon their petition, because they have often refused them ; they think that the majority of the people (I do not say that they think right)—but they think the majority of the people are or may be with them ; they say, they wish to collect the sense of the majority of the people ; they therefore wish that a convention o delegates from different parts of the country should be called, by whom they should first collect what was the sense of the people by whom they were delegated ; and if it appears to be what they contend it is, that it shall then be comtaunicated to parliament—This it is said is mere pretext. 
GIBBS 11686 Now, let'us examine it’ in its parts.—The first proposition is, that the House of Comfons is corrupt—I do not mean to say that the House of Commons is corrupt; but I am examining whether Mr. Hardy, who has inned his faith upon the duke of Richraond, as not ground for saying so, and that that eorruption proceeds from the want ofa proper representation of the people in the House of Commons. What does the duke of Richmond say upon that subject 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11687 He says, in his letter to colonel Sharman,The lesser reform has been attempted with every possible advantage in its favour, not only from the zealous support of the advocates for a more effectual one, but from the assistance of men of great weight, both in and out of power; but with all temperaments and helps it has failed ; not one proselyte has been nee from corruption, nor has the least ray of hope been held out, from any quarter, that the House of Commons was‘inclined to adopt any other mode of reform.—Why, then it is not a suggestion first of Mr. Hardy and his: friends, that the House of Commons was corrupt, and that this was the means of reforming it; his great prototype the duke of Richmond, the man whose a he has followed, and whose disciple e is, told: him, in express terms, that the House of Commons is corrupt, and that that corruption proceeds from the people not being oped re preneile in the House of Commons. 
GIBBS 11688 he remedy, then, that is to be applied to this, is, in the opinion of Mr. Hardy and his friends, annual parliaments and universal suffrage. Why, what does the duke of Richmond say upon that subject Hle says, 
GIBBS 11689 “From every day’s experience to the present hour, I am more and more convinced, that the restoring the right of voting universally to every man not incapacitated by nature for want of reason, or by law by the commission of crimes, together with annual elections, is the only retorm that can be effectual and permanent: I am further convinced that it is the only reform that is practicable. 
GIBBS 11690 “ All other plans that are of a palliative nature, have: been found insufficient to interest and animate the body of the people, from whose earnestness alone any reform can be expected
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11691 A long exclusion trom any share in the legislature of their country, has rendered the great mass of the people indifferent whether the monopoly that subsists, continues in the hands of a more or less extended company, or whether it is divided by them into shares of somewhat more or less just proportions; the public feels itself unconcerned in these contests, except as to the oppressions it endures, and the exactions it suffers, which it knows must continue so leng as the peop: remain deprived of all control over their nPresentatives. What I call for, he says, ‘ is, not cocveniency, but right; if it is not a mazim our constitution, that a British: subject ist be governed only by laws to which be bs consented by himself,. or his representa, we should instantly abandon the error; batf itis the essential of freedom, founded on the eternal principles of justice and wisdom, 14 our unalienable birthright, we should mt hesitate in asserting it. Let us, then, bt determine to act upon this broad principle of giving to eyery man his own, and we immediately get rid of all the perplexitieste which the narrow notions of Partiality ad exclusion must ever be subject. 
GIBBS 11692 Now it is objected to Mr. Hardy, that ths idea of the corruption of the House of Com Mons; corruption proceeding from sn mproper representation there—that this idea of referming parliament by annual election, 's all pretext. What foundation is there fr that, when you have heard from twenty wit nesses im the cause, that Mr. Hardy has over and over again said, he forms himself upor the: duke of Richmond’s plan, which be wishes to be carried into execution ; that tht is his only object; and when this, which ke pretences in all his letters, which appears in fact the object he is pursuing, 3s, it terms, the reform which the duke ef Richmond by a publication recommends to tte people to ban ? hen, gentlemen, we have got this length 
GIBBS 11693 —that the corruption of parliament is pots thought of Mr. Hardy’s—that the cause of that corruption is net a thought of Mr. Hady’s—that the means by which that comuption might be remedied is not a thought of Mr. Hardy's; they are all the thoughts of the duke of Richmond, supported by these ret sons which you heard read while his gree was in court.—I have stated to you what the immediate means were—annual parliaments, and universal suffrage—The next thing be considered is, how that reform was tobe effected.—Mr. Hardy thinks—but that is ss to be pretext—that it may be effected, and he meant to effect it, by a convention of the peo le, and by collecting the sense of the peope rom that convention.—What does the dake of Richmond say upon that subject
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11694 He says, “ the weight of corruption has this more gentle’—speaking of a lesser re form, —“ as it would have defeated sy more efficacious plan in the same circum: stances; from that quarter, therefore, I hare malting to hope—it is from the Trey u large that I expect any good. Why, thes, when such a man as the duke of Richmond tells the public that parliament has been pe tioned so often for this redress that they il not grant it; when he tells them thet be still expects this to be granted, and tele 
GIBBS 11695  ne that it is fromthe people at large only that he expects it will be obtained, how is this man at the bar to understand the duke of Richmond
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11696 What was the mildest sense he sould put upon his words ?—From the people 
GIBBS 11697 ; at large the duke of Richmond ex hopes aM a at ts this reform—he does not expect it from the parliament—he knows the parliament will not t it? but he expects it from the people
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11698  
GIBBS 11699 hen the people must have some lawful means of promoting it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11700 I think the most rational, I think the most peaceable; I think the most constitutional construction that can be -put upon that expression is, that it is to be expected from the sense of the people at large, first collected, and then conveyed to the House of Commons—not acting by force; unquestionably, the duke ef Rich
GIBBS 11701 ‘ mond could never mean that ; but he expected this refurm from the people at large, because he hoped that they would declare publicly what their wishes were, and that those wishes being communicated to the House of Commons, would produce the reform which he wished to see effected. 
GIBBS 11702 Gentlemen, I think this ie fair reasoning ; I think this must be the construction which 
GIBBS 11703 ‘ou will put upon the duke of Richmond's tter: It cannot be said that a man possessing so enlightened a mind, and holding sucha rank in the state, as the noble duke, meant by this letter to colonel Sharman, to incite the people to take up arms against their government, and to enforce that which would otherwise be denied to them. He must be understood, therefore, to have -expected that the people at large, by-their opinions being collected, and those opinions being communicated to the legislature, would produce that reform for which be was so zealous au ad
GIBBS 11704 ‘vocate, 
GIBBS 11705 What, then, has deen the conduct of the prisoner, as testified by every part of the evidence in this cause
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11706 That he uniformly acted upon the duke of Richmond’s plan; that he pursued that only which the duke of Richmond wished to be carried into effect : that he promoted it by the means by which the duke of Richmond wished to see it accomplished.—Who, then, can say ‘that he meant any thing farther than the duke of Richmond meant? Is it not, I will ask you, possible at least to put upon these acts of the prisoner the construction I put upon the language of the duke of Richmond? Is it not Possible, upon all these acts, that bis object should have been for the convention to collect the sense of the people, and state it to parliament? J ask you first, is it not possible ?—If it be possible, and if you find that shat was the duke of Richmond's plan, and if you fine that this man has universally declared that his object was only to do that which the duke pointed out in his plan, surely you will not then, for. the sake of fixing guilt upon him, Presume that he meant more than the duke of Richmond meant—but rather inclining onthis the side of innocence—inclining ‘to a man upon whom guilt is not directly proved, you will say that he meant what the duke of Richmond did mean—that he meant this convention should act as the duke of Richmond meant the people at large should act, by collecting the general opinion, and conveying it, not by force of arms, but peaceably, to the House of Commens1. 
GIBBS 11707 Gentlemen, it is a principle, I. think, in the English law, that, when the act-of a man is indifferent or doubtful, it should rather be attributed to an innocent than a guilty motive, —And I hope that we have not lost sight of another principle by which English juries have always been governed ; namely, that if the act of a man be in itself indifferent, and there be evidence, some having a tendency to show it criminal, and some innocent, if the former does not most clearly overweigh the latter, humanity will turn the scale in favour of innocence, 
GIBBS 11708 With respect to this act of calling a convention, it being in its nature an innocent act, you heard read a protest of several learncd, peers upon a motion that was made in the House of Lords during the pressure of the American waz, when the burthens which that war produced were felt heavily by the subject. Lord Shelburne made a motion in the [louse of Lords, the ultimate object of which was to decrease those burthens; the immediate object was, that a committee should be called, consisting neither of placemen nor of pensioners, to inquire what unnecessary expenses arose in the public expenditure—what unnecessary places existed — what unnecessary ensions had been granted —and to inquire ow that expenditure might be lessened. 
GIBBS 11709 After a long debate, the motion was negatived ; but those who were in the minority, if they were weighed not by their number but by their merits, would be called a majority: There was at their head the venerable and learned earl Camden, as great a constitutional lawyer as this country has ever seen, and as firm a supporter of its constitution
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11710 There were many more, some of whom are now acting in administration.— The duke of Portland, the duke of Grafton, lord Fitzwilliam, the duke of Rutland, the duke of Devanshire, lord Rockingham, lord Scarborough, and, true to his old principles, the duke of Richmond; they were in the minority; the motion was negatived; but they protested against the negative that was put upon that motion; they assigned their reasons to the public—they wished to hand down to posterity their reasons for thinking that that committee ought to have been instituted, and that inquiry set on foot ; and the fourth reason which they assign is this: 
GIBBS 11711 “ We are further impelled to press this motion, because the object of it has been secunded and called for by a considerable majority of the people, who are associating for is purpose, and seem determined to pursue 
GIBBS 11712 4 by every legal and constitutional method that can be devised for its success
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11713 There you have lord Camden’s authority, that the people may legally and constitutionally asSociate for the purpose of obtaining an end which appears to them publicly benefieial— “ And however some may affect to be alarmed as if such associations tended to disturb the peace, or encroach upon the delegated power of the other House, we are persuaded it has No other view but to collect the sense of the people, and to inform the whole body of their Tepresentatives what are the sentiments of the whole body of their constituents. 
GIBBS 11714 Then this learned and noble lord asserts the collecting the sense of the people at large to be the object of the associations of the people; that the object of those associations is, to communicate te the whole body of the representatives what are the opinions of the whole body of their constituents
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11715 That was the object of the man who stands at your bar; that was the object of all those who acted with him; they meant to call, not an association of the whole people, but something less tumultuous—a convention of delegates sent by the people at large, by whose means they sight collect what were the opinions of tne whole hody of their constituents, and might, by the same organ, communicate them to the whole body of their representatives.— And if it be asked what farther is to be done if these petitions are rejected, the best answer js, that the case cannot be supposed ; for although, upon a few separate petitions, it may be fairly said that the other House ought not to be decided by a part only of their constituents, yet it cannot be presumed they will act in defiance of the united wishes of the whole people, or indeed of any great and notorious majority.—Then here I get another step; separate petitions had been rejected; Separate petitions might be rejected; the House ot Commons might not feel it necessary to attend to separate petitions ; but if a petition could be got from these general asSociations of the people, such a petition would be legal and constitutional, and, according to the opinion of lord Camden, ought to be attended to—ougbt to have so much weight in his estimation, that it is not to be supposed that so wise a body as the House of ComMons would not yield to it. 
GIBBS 11716 Gentlemen, is that illegal to which lord Camden, so great a lawyer, gives such an effect, when he states, that petitions offered by the general associations of the people, ought to be attended toby the House of Commons, and that it is inconsistent with their wisdom to reject them? Does not he, by this protest, hold out to the public, that, when separate petitions are rejected, the object of which is thought conducive to the public good, it is the right of the people to associate for that public good, and, being associated, to present such petitions as lord Camden tells them are not likely to be rejected? 
GIBBS 11717 “It is admitted that the House of Con. mons have a power to vote as they think f, but it is not possible to conceive that so wae an assembly will ever be rash enough tore ject such petitions, and by that means cane this dangerous question to be broached ad agitated whether they have not broke they trust? The voice of the people will certainly be complied with; ministers may, as they seen to have done in a recent instance, departany man of what he holds, at their pleasur, for presuming to exercise his undoubted ngt! of thinking for himself on these and o public subjects, but it will not be wis a them to treat these associations with ce. tempt, or call them by the invidious name a faction, a name by which the minority of both Houses of Parliament have been so iruently and s0 falsely calumniated, becas: the name sd applied, will recoil back ups themselves, when acting against the gener! sense of the nation, nor will they be able represent these numbers, so respectable a rank and property, as they did but too succesfully the discontented Americans, as a mb of indigent and seditious incendiaries, becaxe the people to whom this is addressed, are the very people that are abused, and every ma bears within himself the testimony of i falsehood. .. 
GIBBS 11718 Gentlemen, my reason for bringing forward this protest to you is, that you may seeit has been the opinion of great and enlighened men in this country, that associations of the people for the purpose of obtaining that which they conceive to be a redress of 3 national grievance, are not only lawful bit commendable ; for if they were only strictly lawful, and were not commendable, we s! not see the names ef such men as we doaat the bottom of this protest, publicly decar ing, that, because this appeared to be the voice of the people collected in their assoc tions, therefore it was incensistent with tbe wisdom of the House of Commons to rejed the prayer of these petitions. a 
GIBBS 11719 Now, gentlemen, if this be so—if this man at the bar has always acted upon the dake of Richmond’s plan—if the duke of Richmol has conianily pointed out to him ip all bs publications (it is not necessary for me Into more than that which I have stated) tha there exists this corruption in the state, may be remedied by these means—that th people have a right to act for themselves a the way I have stated ; if it be the opin men so eminent as those, whose nsmes Yo haye heard are at the bottom of this proiesy that associations of this sort ought to be tended to, how is the prisoner implicated ia any guilt charged upon him in this ment? Recollect the principle whieh I bere stated, and which cannot, I am sure, F that if you can attribute his actions to 2 BS Motive, you ought not to ascribe to a criminal one—I defy any man SY: that. there is direct proof, pesoom that the prepared any force for pad ya this convention ; and then if you find he ries constant} 
GIBBS 11720 declared that he followed plans of a dif3 ferent nature, if you find that general associations for such a purpose are lawful, how can you say, that he who projected only the calling a convention, for the purpose of parkamentary reform—who states, that it was for the purpose of takin: 
GIBBS 11721 into consideration the proper modes for obtaining a full and fair representation of the people
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11722 How can ou presume against the constant tenor of his ife—against the constant language he held upon the i a the conduct of that man, whose precepts ehas constantly followed 
GIBBS 11723 —against the doctrine laid down in this protest, that associations for this purpose are legal and constitutional? How can you presume against all this, that his conduct was 
GIBBS 11724 Not legal and constitutional, though he always professed to follow the examples of men who acted legally and constitutionally ; though he professes in his resolutions to follow them only by legal and constitutional means? How can you presume that he had that illegal intent which the indictment charges him with, namely, that he called this convention for the purpose, by force of arms, of deposing the king, and putting him to death; that would not be a charitable conclusion — it would not be a conclusion to which Englishmen have ever upon such evidence arrived, and I am sure therefore that it will not be yours. 
GIBBS 11725 Let me suppose for a moment, that that noble person who has given his evidence in this cause, could descend from his high station, and become the advocate of this prisoner. What would he have had to say in his defence? would he not say, “ Look to the ay of this; it was my plan, he is my disaple, he has followed my doctrine, he has pend my principles by the means which pointed out to him; I told the public that annual parliaments and universal suffrage, was the only reform to be introduced into the House of Commons, which would remove the grievances under which we labour —J told the public, that they had a right to assemble, and to make their voice heard in the House of Commons; I not only told the public this at the time when I brought forward my motion, but I left with the public the reasons which induced me to form this Opinion, and these reasons have since been Operating upon the mind of this man at the bar—his sins, if he has sinned, are upon my head; if he has been misled, he has been misled by me, he has pursued the same object, by the same means; but (it is said) he’ 
GIBBS 11726 has used harsh language, he has entered into Improvident resolutions. Why he may; he 18 an ignorant man; his resolutions may have been improvident; may have been rash; may have been illegal; his language may have been so—but when I have af him to this; when I gave him the principle; when his end is the same as mine; when the means he uses are the same: namely, by the intervention of the Peon 3 a little indiscretion ; a little violence of language, and even a little illegality, is to be excused in a man in his situation. 
GIBBS 11727 “ I have high rank in the state; I have the advantages of great abilities ; t industry ; education; experience; knowledge; and an enlightened mind to direct me; I used them all, endeavouring to lead my judgment to a true conclusion, upon what was really salutary to the public upon this subject; they led me to conclude, that annual parliaments and universal suffrage, were the only means by which the public could be saved ; and led me also to conclude, that the people had a right to annual parliaments and universal suffrage ; and that if the House of Commons did net grant them upon private petitions, that to the people was the proper appeal, and the people would then make their own voice heard the House of Commons; this I told the poor man ; he learned it from me; he has not my advan ; with all these advantages I entertained the opinion which this man, who has none of them, following me entertains; he has on his side nothing but i ces it is not wonderful that he should have beenconvinced by the reasons whieh I published, and which induced me to entertain this opinion of a convention of the people, nothin on the other side ‘having been published, which could come into his hand: therefore surely it is reasonable to expect that you will presume he has acted bone fide. 
GIBBS 11728 “ But he has gone greater lengths than I have; well, that ma excused in him; he is an ignorant man, he has not the advantages Thave; he has not had the advice I might have to follow; he has met, too, with greater prsroctions than I ever met with; J had a rge train of followers in the House of Lords; the propositions which I brought forward, were never rejected with disdain end contumely; I had never the provocation that this man has had from the treatment that he has received ; I will not inquire whether the. provocation be well or ill founded, but it is still provocation which a eommon mind was likely to be moved by. 
GIBBS 11729 Gentlemen, these are the lope which the duke of Richmond himself, if he could be placed in my situation, and argue the case of the prisoner, would urge to you; but if he felt for a moment that this man’s life was in danger, his blood would eurdle in his veins; he would shudder at the mischiefs produced by his publication, and wish in vain to recall it; he would implore you upon his knees, not to find any guilt in Mr. Hardy, that you would not be ready to find in him; he would tell yor that the prisoner has done neing which is not imputable to him, nothing whic! he would not have done himself; his principles are the same, his objects the same ; that the means of attaining these objects avowed by him, and proved in this cause, are, tention you will pay te his lordship, when te the same; nota single expression has been| comes to sum up, for distinguishing bow proved upon Mr. Hardy, tending a different way, and surely, gentlemen, it is a great excuse for a man in the situation oflife in which the prisoner stands, to urge that he followed the same object which the duke of Richmond points out by the same means: I say by the same means, because it is not proved by that plain direct and manifest proof which the statute calls for, and which lord Coke says is tequired, that he has used any other; then penn me to add that the circumstance of his ing always avowed an adherence to the plan of the duke of Richmond, ought to lead you to a conclusion that in this case he mean Rot to go beyond it1. 
GIBBS 11730 Gentlemen, what I have troubled you with hitherto, is chiefly upon the general evidence of the plan that has been laid before you. 
GIBBS 11731 Gentlemen, you collected from an argument which we had in the early part of this cause, that none of the evidence admitted in it, which is not brought personally home to Mr. Hardy, ought at all to affect him, otherwise than as it it may prove (which was the object of it) a general conspiracy in the coun‘try to call together a convention, which was to be supported by force against the government; with that view nine-tenths of the evidence that has been read was admitted, and with that view only; and it was stated by the Court, that Mr. Hardy was not to be affected by any of that evidence, any farther than he might be proved afterwards to be engaged in that plot, and to the extent only that he was proved to be engaged init; namely, in the plot of calling together a convention for the purpose of attaining their end against the government, by force of arms, re is proof enough to show that Mr. Hardy did mean that a convention should be called; he certainly did, and I do not dispute it, but the question for you will be, whether Mr. Hardy, the individual standing at your bar, did in his mind intend that that convention should act by force against the government. 
GIBBS 11732 Now, gentlemen, wish it-were within the compass of my ability to have separated the evidence, and to have laid distinctly before you, what evidence does apply to Mr. Hardy, upon this point.. I admit that his case refe it. Iadmit that his counsel ought to lo it; and I have but one excuse for not doing it, which is, that to the reach of my ability, the thing was impossible; though I have had the accidental leisure of a Sunday to look into the papers 5 yet from not having a copy of a third part of the letters that have been produced in evidence, except those which are in the report (and I do not mean to blame any one thatI have them not) though I endeavoured to do it. I wasted a considerable pore tion of my time, and I found it, at last, absolutely impracticable. I must, therefore, leave itto you. I trust to your recollection, to the notes which you have taken, and to the atmuch of this affects Mr. Hardy. In my4prehension, none of it goes to show, that m is mind, there existed a design of effecting s pert in the parliamentary representatioc, yy force. 
GIBBS 11733 You observe, gentlemen, that, in the forms part of my argument, I contended, that thee existed no such design; if there did, whet is another fae of my argument, there is 2 colour for fixing any thing, as it seems to me, ‘apon Mr. ly, the prisoner. gentlemen, it is in evidence to you, that Mr. Hardy bas never been without a spy at his elbow for the last two years, from the year 1792 tll the time that he was apprehended ; he bas never been at any meeting, he has never been with any assembly of friends at which there wa not present some person who has carried the ears of government every thing that wis said, by every person, at these meetings. Is it not singular then, that with the disposition which these men had to produce a reform (3 I admit they had) that not one single expr sion, upon any occasion, is proved to bare dropped from the mouth of Hardy, showing disrespect either to the King, oy to the Lords? But I would not rely much upon that : Isit not aleo singular, that not even an hasty epressions nut an accidental word, has ever fallen from him, to show, that it ever was if his contemplesis to use force for any pupose? And is it possible, that if he had conceived in his mind a design of carrying the project of that convention by force, walt as he has been, with spies constantly about him, some unguarded word should not at some time or other, have fallen from him, indicating, that be had entertained such an intention’ You will observe, that though it is 8 pat of bid evi enes of the crown to show fe Sie lot, and, for that purpose, they have jor general avnletins, vas you have another uestion to try; you are to say, notonly whe ther there was any such plot; but, if ther was, whether Hardy was an actor in it, embraced, in his mind, all its criminal views? For you are trying his intentions in calling this convention, whether it was the object o! his mind, that, when called, it should act by force? No matter who meant it, if be not; if that was not the intention of Mr. Hardy, you cannot find him guilty ; andi it was his intention, I do think it utterly impo sible, that going into the history of his lie for two years, going into every aet of it, tending him at every meeting that be ee attended, with spies whose ears were one upon all occasions, it is utterly impossible ad think, that some expression, some gus! word, should not have fallen from him sm ing that this was his intention. No such is proved to have fallen from him; 00 ression from which it can be presumed, be entertained such an idea. Is this en ding to the cofumon course of human «io 
GIBBS 11734 Does the hisfory 6f human life furnish you with a single instance of a man, having a certain plan in his mind, for two years together, meeting persons, with whom he is supposed to have been associated for the purpose of carrying that plan into execution, conversing with them upon the subject which would naturally lead to it, with the utmost freedom,— Supposing himself not watched; supposing himself to be talking with men, in whom he might repose the most certain confidence; do you find any instance, in the history of human nature, that a man the most artful and wily, through the course of two whole years, has never in confidence dropt an expression, showing he entertained that design which was lurking in his heart? Does the history ef human nature furnish you with such an instance? And, if it docs not, surely your humanity, your good nature will lead you to say, that it bas not existed, for the first time, in this unfortunate man at the bar. Gentlemen, you are trying an act of his mind; you are trying whether it was Ais intention to compass this end by force; if it were not, whether such was the intention of any other person is immaterial. Then, if he has never suffered to escape from him an expression, feom which that can be collected; if all that has fallen from his lips, for the last two years, ‘bas been communicated to those who accuse him, being, as he supposed himself always to be, in company with friends andconfidents, when he was in company with spies, surely it is too hard to say, that he entertained in his mind, during all this time, a project, fconcerning which he never uttered a syllable, even to those with whom it is pretended that he conspired ; that is too much for human credulity to give faith to. , If Mr. Hardy were a man of profligate man‘Bers and dissipated life; if he were a man likely, from the tenor of his conduct, to rush into a plan of this sort; if I could presume, from his general habits, that he was disposed to entertainand to pursue violent objects, by Violent means, there might be something in this case. But you have heard the character that has been given of him; I think I never heard so universal and complete a character iven by 90 many persons, of an individual in is situation, in my life. All sorts of persons have been called to you ; his neighbours ; his friends; those with whom he fived in intiMacy; those of the same business with himself; some his countrymen ; some not; all of them, concur in saying, that he isa man of the most amiable disposition, and respectable character; that he is a man of the most peaceable mind; that he is the last man in the world whom they should ever think capable of entertaining such a project as is now imputed to him.‘The minister whom he attends has been called; he not only says, that his conduct in life has been exemplary, his manners amiable 
GIBBS 11735 4nd peaceable, but he tells you, that conversing with him upon political subject, he enSeatourel to draw fear him what his object was, and the means by which he meant to attain that object; that he always told him, it was parliamentary reform, upon the duke of Richmond’s plan, and that the means by which he meant to obtain that object were peaceable. You observe, that these witnesses whom we called to his character, were not all eople of his way of thinking, but that some fad differed with him in politics. I believe that is in evidence. I know, however, the fact tobe so. They all concurred in saying, that, during all the time they have known him, some for twenty years, his masters whom he served, all concurred in saying, a better character never belonged to man. 
GIBBS 11736 Gentlemen, this is a case in which, of all others, a Pane character ought to weigh; because this is a case in which you are trying the act of the prisoner’s mind; in which you are trying, whether he had conspired with others to pull down this government by torce? Whether he was ready to take arms in his own hand, and attack the established powers of the country? That is the question you are to try; and, if you find any thing short of that; if youdo not find that it was the design of Mr. Hardy to attack the government by force, through the means of a convention, it is impossible you should find him guilty. 
GIBBS 11737 Then, gentlemen, surely this character ought to weigh; surely a man of such peaceable manners as belong to him, ought not lightly to be presumed capable of such an act; and when you add, too, that his conduct has been most diligently scrutinized, for two years, ina manner which no man could be aware of; when you find, that they are acquainted with every thought of his mind, that has found expression by his tongue, and that no word has ever fallen from him indicating a criminal intention, it is not too much to expect you to say, that, whatever other men may have intended upon this subject, he had not those views which are imputed to him, and therefore ought to have your verdict in his favour. 
GIBBS 11738 Gentlemen, let me remind you again of what the point is which you have to try; it is, whether Mr. Hardy, at the time he cont curred in the resolution for calling this cone vention, did himself personally mean, that the convention, being called, should act by force of arms against the government? That is the joint which you have to try
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11739 Mr. Hardy’slife as been sifted : It is not proved, that; through the whole course of it, conversing with men upon the subject of this intended convention, and of the parliamentary reform? meant to be effected by it, he ever cisipgessingle expression, from which it can be col lected, that he meant to use force ; if he didi not mean to use force, he must be acquittefl of the charge now brought against him.—Thathe did not, I think this evidence goes fully to prove ; and, therefore, I trust in God that you will give him your verdict of acquittal. 
EYRE 11740 Mr. Hardy, the counsel whom you have had assigned to you at your own request, have hitherto conducted your defence, examined your witnesses, and each of them has addressed himself to the jwry on your behalf: you are alco at full liberty to speak for yourself, if you wish to do so; and if you do, this is the proper time for you to be heard.

THOMAS_HARDY 11746 Mr. Solicitor General. May it please your Eaclakpe gentlemen of the jury—The Defence of the Prisoner being now closed, it is my duty to address you in reply to what has fallen from the learned counsel, and for the purpose of (in some degree) summing up the evi e that has been given. You have no doubt been impressed with the very able and very powerful speech which you have last h delivered; and Iam; happy in the opportunity of congratwlating, wnyself, and the rofession, upon the axentians Af abilities which think have beem Aqaany which I have ever witnessed.

THOMAS_HARDY 11747 I must coni bewevnuthakpvith respect to one thing whish bli fronpy jing counsel for the priggner, and wiaglhsowas repeated in the courseof what hey gaid,4aj-you gentlemen, [felt great surprise. Argqr to what he said when he talked to yoq af the policy of a verdict—I have ever been tayght to think that a jury of Englishmen, sworn tp decide upon the hfe of their fellow Englishman, are to decide only according to the truth of the case which is made out in evidence before them, without turning aside to the right, or to the deft, ‘keeping. perpetually the direct course, and attending only to the evidence before them, the law as it affects that evidence, and what is the conclusion which they ought to come to, without entering intoa consideration, either on the one side or the other, of any political circumstances whatever ; and much should we have to lament, if political circumstances, or any circumstances beyond the particular case before the jury, should in any dego weigh with them. The trial by jury is great safety of the state itself, of fy individual member. If we suffer it to perverted one way or the other, we remove from the constitution of the government the great control which the people of this country have reserved in their own hands; that control which prevented the tyranny ofCromwell from reaching to such extent as might have done, which first shook James th: second upon his throne, and which at all tins has preserved, and which at all times will,Itrust, be found sufficient to preserve the rights and privileges of the subject, as well as tk constitution of the state. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11748 In common and ordinary criminal cass, beyond the particular case, and beyond te mischief that may arise from crimes gv unpunished, in whatever way the verdxts given, no great inconvenience can result ; ba in cases which so greatly affect the state a the charge of high treason does, the safety of the state itself may be fatally involved; ba it is your duty to diseard even that considention. You are simply to give your verddt according to that which, in your conscienca, you stall believe to be the truth of the ca, as made out to you in evidence, and wholly discard every other consideration. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11749 Gentlemen, in following my learned friewds, who have appeared as counsel for the prisone, T have considerable difficulty—a dificulty which, perhaps, in some degree the case i Poses upon me, but I think thus far appeats clear, that they have not attempted to invalidate the truth of any one important faet, but as far as I am able to judge, the trush of every important fact stands, in effect, admitted upon the defence which the prisoner's cut have made. They have endeavoured qualify; they have endeavoured to throw some obloquy upon particular witnesses; bet I think you will observe, that, upoa the whok, every attempt of that sort (in some respect, perhaps, justly founded), but every attemp of that sort has failed of shaking the mam great points of the case. On the contrary, my learned friends, with a great degree of judgment, have omitted even to touch upon some of the strong parts of the case. I would also observe that the facts which have beet stated by the witnesses who have given testimony, are facts in general to which greab numbers were also privy, which might, there fore, be contradicted by great numbers, if they had not been truly stated by the witnesses, and, therefore, you have the strongestfur presuming that it was impossible by-the production of any witnesses against them te touch these facts, With respect to one of them, which I observe was noticed by Mr. Gibbs, I mean what passed oD the and of May, where he chose to sup| there might he a considerable degree of diff culty in finding out what questions to ask the witness, or finding out persons who could give evidence to contradict him, I believe shee were at the moment several gentlemen 8 court who were present upon that occas, one of them an officer of the court, whomIhave: seen here constantly during the 02, who sat next Mr. Horne Tooke at that me ing, and who could have contradicted Mr. Groves, if he had said apy thing win 
THOMAS_HARDY 11750 '; With respect to some part of what has been by my learned friends, I really have thought it an attack upon Mr. Burke, the duke of Richmond, his majesty’s ministry, 
THOMAS_HARDY 11751 ; the constitution itself; rather than a defence of the prisoner at the bar. All these conside
THOMAS_HARDY 11752  Tations, it appears to me, ought to be thrown entirely out of the case. You are merely to decide upon the evidence before you, and upon that evidence as it applies to the prisoner. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11753 Conceiving, therefore, that my friends have not been able materially to shake any of the 
THOMAS_HARDY 11754  important facts of the case, I shall very shortly take a view of the law of the case, and consider it with reference to what appears to me to be the striking and leading facts. But it is necessary first to observe, that as the meaning and intention of the acts imputed to the pri
THOMAS_HARDY 11755 " soner are more questioned than the acts themselves, it may be important a little to attend to the evidence as it may appear to impute that meaning and intent to him, in common with a great number of other persons. Itdid not enter into the mind of the attorney genetal when he opened this case to you, to impute to the great mass of people concerned in these transactions any such meaning or intent as he imputes to the prisoner at the bar. He conceived, on the contrary, that the proceedings were, generally speaking, a system of fraud and deception; always professing one thing, and really meaning another ; confining the Eamwicdae of their true meaning and intent to a few persons, who were the directors and the leaders of the whole, who had the whole business in effect under their management, If this were matter of doubt with us before the cause was opened, we can have no doubt of it now. It is impossible to doubt that there was great secrecy in parts of the transaction, that a few transacted the whole, and that the rest blindly submitted to what course they directed. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11756 Gentlemen, the whole cross-examination ofheard the Sheffield witnesses, and the whole of the Original examination of the witnesses for the Prisoner, and their cross-examination, seems to me to show, that a vast majority of the persons who were engaged in the transactions which have been brought before you for discussion, have been persons who implicitly Save up their judgment to their leaders. You will recollect the manner in which Broomhead described it. He said, “ they listened to their great orators, as to their guides and directors ; vee not the vanity to think that they id form a proper plan of proceeding; they, therefore, passed a string of resolutions, as Broomhead distinctly stated, “ in compliment to those who drew them UPbelieving those Persons to be men of knowledge, and having confidence in their judgment. Some of them appear, through a perfect inattention, merely to have done as others did; and Dowling, you will recollect, in speaking of the transactions at Chalk-Farm, said, that when the resolutions were read, and speeches made, he was at such 4 distance he could not hear what was said, but gave his vote in consequence of seeing all the rest vote. Some of dem described themselves as being totally inattentive, You will recollect Archibald Hunter, a man who described himself at last, as having been a hair-dresser and perfumer ; but who had, as he represented, forgotten what trade he had been of before he lived upon his means. He stated that he heard the resolutions at ChalkFarm and the Globe tavern read, but he did not dote; he took no part in them; and he said of himself, that this arose merely from the inattention which pervades his whole conduct. I can easily helieve that many other persons were as inattentive as this man was, and engaged as he did in such societies as this, without adverting to consequences. It is indeed miserable, that there should be such men, but more miserable that there should be persons who take upon them to lead such men, and to decide for them upon acts which are, unquestionably, at least of great importance, not only to those men themselves, but to every other man who lives in this country. For inattentive men, like these, might be led to the most violent measures, without in the least judging for themselves upon the subject. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11757 Gentlemen, almost every one of the wit- — nesses who were proiace’ on the part of the prisoner from the London Corresponding Society (for I think there is only one from the Constitutional Society) but almost every one of the witnesses for the prisoner from the London Corresponding Society has been of this description; and the only witness who was of the Constitutional Society, was Mr. Wills, the dancing-master, who was a member of both societies. He said he was little acquainted with their proceedings; he never looked into their books, though it appeared that the books of the Constitutional ces constantly lay upon their table; he never of a secret committee, or a committee of correspondence, till he read it in the newspapers, though it has been proved that the whole business was transacted by the committee of correspondence, or secret committee, That committee was not, indeed, originally named a secret committee, but it got that name, as a nick name, from all its proceedings being secret; and finally it got that name from its very members. Upon the whole of the evidence of Wills, you must be persuaded that he was nota man whom they would have sought as a member of either of the societies from any other motive, than that he appeared very willing tu part with his money, and probably was in better circumstances than most of them were. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11758 The producing witnesses of this kind is a strong circumstance; because if they had meant that the transactions of the London Sorespons ing Society should be openly examined; if they had thought the transactions of that society could bear the face of open day, would they not have brought the acting men, the managers of the society, those men whostance ; because it shows, that those who tal had been delegates, who had been of thethe management of affairs, at Sheffield, bezaa committees, so far as they were not directlyto find that Widdison did see a little into the implicated in the accusation now made?business, and therefore that very inoportant But not one man is brought forward, who hasletter was not communicated to him

You willwith respect to the pikes, at Sheffield, wasa recollect the circumstances under which heimposition upon the minds of the peope pre his evidence, and the temper with whichthere. For what was the case? The alam e gave it. For I must beg to deny what iswas spread—how, God knows—but an alam -asserted by the counsel for the prisoner, thatwas spread, that the aristocrats, as they calied you are to give equal credit to every part ofthem, were going to arm against them, andwhat a witness says.—When a jury perceives, disperse their meetings. For you are tl that a witness has a bias upon tis mind, theythat Yorke, Gale, and Davison,—and vw aye to try his credit, mccain to that bias.—recollect that Gale has absconded, as has beet It would, unquestionably, be necessary todoproved in the cause, and so has Davison80, if his bias arose from any other cause; but,Yorke, Gale, and Davison, tell them, thatit if it arose from prejudice, you are, neverthe- } was lawful for them to have arms; that they Jess, to weigh that circumstance, and see howwere entitled, by the Bill of Rights, to have it affects his credit. For the most honestarms for their defence; that this aristocrat man in the world would be misled by thatparty would certainly attack them, and there kind of bias; and whien you hear personsfore they ought to provide arms. Itis cle, giving their evidence, and perceive, from thethat such discourse had heen held at She manner, in which they give it, and from thefield; itis clear, that, in consequence of that terms which they use, that they have a biasdiscourse, the minds of these people had bea upon their minds, you are to determine whichagitated with the idea of a civil commotica; -way that bias lies, and to give a due degree of that they were afraid of some attack om? credit to their testimony, having regard to thethemselves; and, under that impress¢t, probable effect of that bias. they had provided themselves with pics Gentlemen, Widdison states that whichWiddison always said, he would have nothits must induce you to think, that he had, at| to dowith it; and you will likewise remea length, seen through the veil which coveredber, that Broomhead told you, there were & these proceedings. For Widdison states, thatpressions of Mr. Yorke, which he recollected, he had agreed in opinion with Yorke; thatas improper expressions, because be felt pal some few weeks before Yorke left Sheffield, when they were used. oe he hada conversation with him about universalThese men were men of that descripts, suffrage ; he told Yorke, he thought that wasthat it required, that they should be going too far, and that he would have nothingto a great degrec to induce them toarm more to do with it. What could have madeselves, under pretence of defending the this alteration in the mind of Widdison, if heselves 3 but when they were once araned, ‘had not perceived, as the matter developedwhat importance was it, whether the ground itself, things which were concealed from himupon which they had been induced 108 before? As he saw farther into the business, was to defend themselves, or not? If ter he thought he saw danger in it, and thereforehad the arms in their hands, they might he would have nouns more to do with it. them offensively, as well as defe a Gentlemen, you will recollect that WiddisonThat the persons who had the directioD a was one of the Sheffield committee, and yetbusiness must very well know, and they i" -he never saw Davison’s letter about the pikes not persons of inferior understanding— 7Now that is an extremely striking circum-Yorke has been described as a perso of superior understanding. He well knew, that, if those personsapprehended any injury to themselves, an application to a magistrate would have tended most effectually to their protection; but he never told them to make that application, He never told them, “If you are afraid of having your houses burnt, or of being insulted in any way, apply to a magistrate for protection. No; he rather chose tomake an impression upon their minds by what had passed from the Church and King party. I can easily conceive, that a violent party might have done very improper things, and very blameable; but use is made of that to induce these men to arm themselves; and that idea being once entertained, you can easily conceive to what length it might be carnied, particularly when you recollect what dropped from one of the witnesses for the prisoner—that there was no difficulty whatever, when the plan was once settled, of having ten thousand pikes forged at Slicfheld, in one day; therefore, all that was wanted was, to have the plan settled ; that they should have some pikes, so that they might know what sort of thing to order ; that the price, which is a very eheap one, should be fixed, and the other little: circumstances arranged, of the length of the pole, and the materials of which it was to be made; and then a very few days would have armed a very large body of men, at Sheffiel, with these pikes; and a body, so armed, might have been used in the manner which you will recollect Yorke stated to Broomhead, and in which those who governed them were well disposed to use them; namely, that rather than be trampled upon, in the way in which they were supposed to be trampled upon, he would have gone at their head, to London. A body of ten thousand men, with pikes, thus led, might have been like the Marsellois you have so often heard of, who have acted at Paris, ia a manner not the most agreeable to humanity. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11760 Gentlemen, in consequence of this plan of fraud, and of this credulity, you will remember, that motions were made on purpose to be rejected. That has been clearly proved in the transactions at Sheffield. The motion to petition parliament was made, unquestionably, for the simple and only purpose of being rejected, in order to its being the foundation of the subsequent proceedings. Domen mean to act fairly and honestly, who act in that way? And did the body of people, who attended upon that occasion, know, that that was a contrivance? The evidence has distinctl shown to you, that they did not know that it was acontrivance. When these men published to the world, in the printed proceedings of what passed at Sheffield, that a motion had been made for a petition to parliament, and had been rejected, and so on, was it not held out to the world as a fair bond fide proceeding? That the motion had been made, and rejected, there were reasons for rejecting it? Whereas, in truth, and in no such discussion ever took place; it was -determined on before hand ; it was made for the purpose of being rejected; and then, being rejected, other proceedings were directly to follow. I think, also, there can be little room to doubt, though there is not direct proof of it, that the proceedings at Shetlicld were printed before the meeting was held. They were printed, certainly, according to the account which Broomhead gave, as nearly as possible to the time ; so that they must have been prepared Jor printing at least before the meeting was actually held. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11761 The proceedings at the Globe-tavern, you recollect, were printed, to be delivered on the eighteenth; whereas the meeting was not held till the twentieth. So it was determined before-hand, that certain resolutions should be passed ; that certain things should be done; the whole proceedings which actually passed at the Globe-tavern, were all contrived before hand, by a knot of people; and, being so contrived, an account of them, describing them as having passed, was put into the hands of the printer; and but for an accident, but for the prisoner’s happening to come in the way, the account would have been distributed before the proceedings were had; for the printer brought two hundred copies to the Globetavern, and he was told to carry them back again, except a few, which were taken perhaps, to be delivered to a few confidential friends. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11762 Gentlemen, you will recollect, also, that the account of the proceedings, at the meeting at Chalk Farm, appeared very early. It does not clearly appear, that the proceedings were Printed before hand; but they must have been all arranged before the meeting actually took place. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11763 It seems to me, therefore, gentlemen, that a system has been pursued, which absolves a great majority of the persons, although certainly very blameable in many transactions in which they have been engaged, from a great part of the highly criminal intent imputed to the prisoner. They acted carelessly; they acted incautiously ; they gave themselves up to their leaders—but they acted without any eal distinct views of what they were doing ; and they acted (many of them) under delusion, under false impressions. One of the witnesses, from Sheffield, I recollect, who was examined this morning (I have unfortunately mislaid the minutes I took of his evidence) but one of them, I recollect, said, that his object solely was, to have things as they were at the Revolution, in 1688; that glorious event, as he described i
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11764 Now, gentlemen, let me call to your minds what change has been made in the constitution of the House of Commons, since. the Revolution in 1683, soon after the Revolution the triennial bill passed, and the septennial act has since followed, That is the sole and only change, since the Revolution, in the House of Commons, except several bills which have had for their object to exclude from the House of Commons, persons holding particular places under the crown, and persons having offices in the collection of the revenue, which might be considered as making them dependant; so that the alteration in the House of Commons since the year 1688, must be considered as rather for the benefit of the people, than disadvantageous to them; and therefore it is clear that the statement which had been made to this Man on the subject, was a mere delusion upon his senses; it is impossible that the facts should have been stated to him in such a manner as to make him fairly comprehend them. And this was not theenly man who was deceived upon this subject ; for I think I remember another witness who said he was for restoring the constitution, as it was in 1688. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11765 Gentlemen, the great majority being thus absolved from the high guilt imputable to the few, the few are involved in a guilt of still deeper die ; not only the guilt which arises from the acts which they have committed, but the guilt which arises from their having induced others to be participators in those acts; who did not know, or who did not attend to what they were about; or who were misled, deceived, and imposed upon, by those who took the lead in these societies. Among these few, the evidence has certainly deeply implicated the prisoner at the bar. He cannot excuse himself as Broomhead, Dowling, Hunter, Wills, and other men of that description, have done. He cannot say he was little acquainted withthe proceedings of the society ; that he toook no part; that he voted resolutions which he never heard. He cannot say that he never heard of the Committee. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11766 of Correspondence, of the Secret Committee. The very name—a Secret Committee—shows that danger was understood to be in their measures ; even the names of the members of this committee were finally unknown to the rest of the society; and by this contrivance, that the existing committee should be dissolved, but should name their successors without making the names of their successors known to the rest of the society. The consepee was, that a body was created, such as believe never was permitted to exist in the pat of any state
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11767 When this business rst came within my notice, I looked into the constitutions of those states which have been supposed to have provisions of this kind, of the most extraordinary nature ; and I believe the Republic of Venice is considered as having the most extraordinary. They have no provision so tyrannical in its nature, or which tight lead to such dreadful consequences, as this Committee of Secrecy, the very names of whose members are unknown. So that this London Corresponding Society, a little state within the state; for such it is, and that is the danger of it, that it isa state within the great state, which is always a dangerous thing to the community ; this London 
THOMAS_HARDY 11768 Corresponding Society was given up to th most despotic dominion that was ever exerci ed upon men; a dominion over their minds beyond all example; for they were led whatever measure their secret committee, consisting of persons whose very names they did not know, might think proper to adopt; and that upon peer of which the rest of the society could have no opportunity of judging. Gentlemen, the very existence of that cret committee was not only in itself danger ous, as it tended to blind their followers, while they were leading them to the brink of every thing terrible before they knew where thy were, but it shows that the dispositions aut intentions of those who formed it, were du erous beyond a possibility of doubt. Fw Bow can it enter into the heart of man to co ceive that their measures were such as ther preted them to be; a fair, an open, and onest attempt to remove what they consdered to be an abuse—how could they cor ceive it was necessary for that purpose to form such ar institution as that which J have staled toyou
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11769 such a proceeding needs nos crecy; it might have been fairly and opealy avowed, as it has been fairly and opealy avowed. For, gentlemen, in this country 9 culative opinions upon government, and upoo any other subject, if they do not immediately tend, by the proceedings taken upon them, by the manner in which they are circulated, and other circumstances, to disturb the quiet of the state, remain untouched,—If they do teod to disturb the quiet of the state, unquestio ably they are necessarily an object of snimadversion: for no state can exist, if perpelull means are taken to disturb the public opinion in favour of its government—for upon what rests the authority of all governments -vernment can be administered only by in prapey oat to the whdle body ; nothing an induce obedience by the many, but an opined that in some way or other their good 1s best consulted by that obedience.—Habits of obedience, habits of submission to particular4ss, induce submission to governments which we (used as we are to the government which the constitution of this country has provic think terrible. That habit of submission duces the inhabitants of those countries continue to submit to the inconveniences they experience, rather than to endanger thet own particular happiness by resistance. Bat if a society may be formed in a state, such a secret committee, accompanied wt! such circumstances, it appears to me that D0 state can be safe. However wisely its vernment may be constituted, however pro perly that government may be administer (so far as the imperfection of the human admits of governments being wisely forme or wisely administered) yet by lowering itthe public opinion, any government whatere! may be destroyed. ‘ entlemen, you will recollect that eve the French Revolution, of which we bir? 
THOMAS_HARDY 11770 heard so much; in the constitution formed by the National Assembly of 1791, that assembly did not conceive it possible for a state to exist unless some restraint was imposed upon the extravagance of opinions, when in their circulation they aimed at the destruction of the state. That assembly also conceived thata state could not exist with such a combination of people in the form of clubs, as appears in this case to have been established in this country; and one of the last legacies which they left to their successors, as the attorney general observed, was a decree (unfortunately never executed) tending to prevent the dangerous effect of clubs by association, afbliation, and delegation, which have ever since continued to disturb that country. Gentlemen, you will find that in the execution of this plan, which I cannot avoid calling a plan of art, of deception, and of mischief, whatever higher name may be attributed to it, the prisoner at the bar must necessarily have been concerned. For he was the person to whom in the character of secretary, all the affixed to al

THOMAS_HARDY 11772 as “a very sensible 
THOMAS_HARDY 11773 “man. You are not therefore to suppose that he was himself aman deluded. Indeed if you attend to. the circumstances, it is impossible you should imagine that he was—you will find that Mr. Hardy was at the constitution of this secret committee which did what it pleased, communicating to the committee of delegates letters or parts of letters, or keeping back let
THOMAS_HARDY 11774 “ ters or parts of letters, as they thought proper; so that all their vast communications by correspondence with the country societies, was entirely in the hands of this small committce, I think of five persons only—He had also his private correspondence aud communications, 
THOMAS_HARDY 11775 ‘ probably unknown even to the secret committee itself, 
THOMAS_HARDY 11776 In the very outset of the London Corres nding Society, in the formation 
THOMAS_HARDY 11777 " of its constitution, you will recollect, and particularly in the progress of it, a very myste
THOMAS_HARDY 11778 Tious correspondence between Mr. Hardy, Mr. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11779 ‘ Vaughan, and Mr. Horne Tooke—you will recollect the perpetual sorrection in the hand‘ writing of Mr. Horne Tooke, of divers papers hot bein ! ponding produced to you; so that (Mr. Horne Tooke a member of the London Corresciety) Mr. Hardy must have acted in communication with him, and probably, from every thing that appears, in many instances without any communication whatever with the rest of the society. The prisoner’s connexion with Margarot and Skirving, is also mysterious; and it is perfectly plain that he did not communicate to the delegates all that between him and Margarot and Skirving, you will recollect that the first plan of gending delegates to the convention at Edinburgh, which afterwards assumed the title of the British Convention, originated in a correspondence between the prisoner and Skirving, which was expressly communicated only to Margarot. It appears by Hardy's letter to Skirving of the 5th of October 1793, that Skirving had written to Hardy privately, about sending these delegates; that Hardy had communicated it to Margarot; that they wished it to be officially communicated to the suciety ; and the prisoner uses these words, “ without any ways mentioning that you have written to me privately. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11780 Gentlemen, here you see was a contrivance to induce the sending delegates from this country to the convention which was intended to be assembled at Edinburgh; and by whom is the contrivance? I do not mean to’ say, that the persons I am going to name, are the people that were concerned in it; but they are all whose names appear in this particular transaction; Skirving, Hardy, and Margarot ; no other person appears at all privy to the original idea; on the 5th of October 1793, Hardy writes to Skirving—From that letter it appears, that there had been a private correspondence between him and Skirving upon this subject; that this had been communi. cated only to Margarot; and that Mi and Hardy, consulting together, determined that it would be proper, that an official letter should be written upon the subject, which Hardy might be able to show to the delegates. If in that official letter Skirving had stated the fact, that there had been a private correspondence between himself and the [poner upon the subject, the delegates would have said, “ where is that correspondence? we have never heard of it before. Therefore the prisoner tells Skirving, do this “ without any ways mentioning that you have written to me privately. Is it not evident from this letter, that the previous correspondence was concealed from the rest of the society, from the committee of delegates, even from the .committee of Secrecy, as well as the body of the society? that all this was a contrivance between Skirving, Hardy, and Margarot, for the purpose of inducing the society to send delegates to this convention? Skirving then sends up a letter, in a great hurry, saying there was No time to be lost. This the Corresponding Society is to communicate to the Constitutional Society, and delegates are chosen, and are sent to Edinburgh
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11781 Probably this was a sudden thought; and I think, when I come to investigate the transaction more particularly, you will be of opinion that it was so, But it demonstrates that the prisoner had the contrivance of all the transactions, and particularly of this transaction. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11782 Gentlemen, if you advert to the correspondence which took place after Margarot and) king in the execution of his authority, ad 
THOMAS_HARDY 11783 Gerrald went to Edinburgh, you will see that the correspondence between the prisoner and them became partly private, and partly of an official nature; and dees is one letter, of the 8th of December, 1795, in which Margarot says to Hardy, “ You may consider this as a private letter; but you may read such parts of it as you may think proper, to any member of the society, especially where it may be productive of good. gentlemen, this letter shows that Margarot had a perfect confidence in the prisoner; that he relied upon him in the whole transaction, and that he left it to his discretion to produce to the rest of the society, such parts of this letter as he should think proper to communicate. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11784 Gentlemen, there are several other letters, with which I will not trouble you, in which it appears that the same sort of secrecy was kept up; and on the 17th of April, 1794, there is a letter from Margarot to Hardy, in which he expressly tells him, “ Show this to nobody. ‘all these circumstances seem to make it impossible to consider Mr. Hardy, either as one who could be deceived, or as inattentive, or ignorant. He must be ranked in the number of those persons who led the society, and as one of the most active. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11785 Gentlemen, considering him in this light, and conceiving, therefore, that the evidence presses as strongy against him as against any other man, I shall endeavour to investigate, first of all, the law upon the subject, and then consider how that law applies to the facts; and I shall go pretty much at large into the law, in eoumegrace of what passed from my learned friend who led the defence for the risoner, and who entered pretty much at rge upon the subject; the gentleman who followed him having also in some degree addressed you upon it. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11786 Gentleinen, the indictment is framed upon the statute of the 25th Edward 3rd, upon which you have heard a great deal. The prisoner is charged with high treason in compassing the death of the king; and you have n told that the law makes the mere intent, followed by any act done in pursuance of that intent amount to the crime of high treason. Therefore the indictment states various acts to have been done by the prisoner, in pursuance of the alleged intent. The first of these is a conspiracy to procure a convention to be assembled to subvert the legislature, and depose the king. Evidence has been given of various matters which I am to contend prove this fact, and several other facts charged in the indictment as overt acts; such as composing and publishing various books and papers, containing incitements to send delegates to the convention—consulting about assembling such convention—agrecing upon the appointment of a committee for that purpose
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11787  These are charges which relate to the assembling the convention.—There is a charge of procuring arms, to oppose with force the foreibly to alter the legislature, and the king.—There is another charge of aco spiracy to levy war—another of a consping to alter the goveramentand depose the king— and others which are nearly of the sam effect, intended to meet all possible ass which might arise on the evidence which has been laid before you.—It is for you to judg, from that evidence, whether the prisonerit the bar, and those with whom it is alleged he conspired, had formed any design which would render their minds guilty within the meaning of the law; and whether he had & monstrated this criminal intent by any act, acts, in furtherance of it, so as to bring him within the penalty of the law. And, genie men, you must likewise consider, whether tk acts so done, have been proved as the law re. quires; that is, one act by two witnesses, a two acts, each by one witness; and whether you give credit to the evidence. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11788 With respect to the formality of the ev dence, as no objection has been taken wit, (and no objection, I apprehend, could be takea to it), I shall not enter into that subject; and I conceive that the only subject for your cam sideration now is, how far you are to gre credit to the evidence adduced, and hov far that evidence, if credited, gives suticiest proof of the charge contained in the indict ment. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11789 Gentlemen, with respect to the question of law in the construction of this statute of the 25th Edward Srd, I venture to lay it downt you as clear law, that forming a design to take any measure by which, if pursued, the kings life may be in danger, and taking any step 0 pursuance of that design, brings the man who Is guilty of forming that design and that step, within the provisions of the statute; and that it is perfectly immaterial whether the acts proposed to be done, or the measures taken, were or were not equal to the purpose. It is sufficient that the intent was conceve, and the act done in pursuance of that intent 
THOMAS_HARDY 11790 Gentlemen, before the statute of the 25th Edward 8rd, (as has been repeatedly stated ou) there was considerable uncertainty in law of treason. Many acts were deemed tre son, which were certainly merely contempts of the king’s authority; and in consequence, the legislature was, in the 25th Edward sr, called upon to define treasons. In doing this, the legislature must have considered, if w suppose the persons who made this law t0 have had the sense and discretion which ord narily belongs to men in that situation, they have been generally considered as mel possessed of great wisdom — indeed it is general observation upon the transactions df the reign of Edward the Srd, particulary with respect to law prosaing, that they were clear, plain, and unembarrassed, & dently the work of very superior mec—t must necessarily have oc to them, thst it was proper for them to consider, when making the law of treason, what necessitythere was for providing the law of treason as a distinct code
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11791 The necessity is clear andplain: An association of people, forming astate, must have some form of government by which the whole body must be submitted to some power. That power is difterently constituted in different governments; but in every government it must of necessity be sovereign, Whatever that power is, it must act for the whole body, it must represent the whole body, and the act of that sovereign wer must, in the government of that state, e taken to be the will of the whole. A state cannot exist without such sovereign power; it is the great bond which binds the whole together, and makes it really a state (for, without such 2 power to control, as well as to direct the actions of all individuals in the state, they never could act as one body, and asa state), thus giving to the whole body the unity which belongs to one person. The conSequence is, that any attempt to destroy the constitution of the power so established, is Necessarily an attempt to destroy the very ; purpose of the association by which the state 1s formed, and consequently to subvert the State itself; for the constitution of the soveTeign power is an essential part of the agrecment, or the compact, or whatever you will call it, upon which the people are united together in one association. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11792 Gentlemen, it is the duty, therefore, of every person who is subject to the sovereign power of a state so constituted, to support, to the utmost of his ability, that power, as the necessary bond of the whole state; and his acting contrary to that duty is treachery to the state itself, and his crime is denominatedtreason. — gentlemen, the true foundation, therefore, of the law of treason, as a distinct code, is the necessity of providing for the safety of the state itself, in the constitution of its sovereign power: as the principal object of the ordinary criminal law is the personal security and particular enjoyments of the subjects of the state as individuals. It has therefore become necessary, in all countries, to make a distinction between those acts which put in hazard the sovercign power of the state, and those which, though they may be contrary to the provisions of the laws, are mercly contempts of the authority of that sovereign power to which the framing and execution of the laws is intrusted, and do not immediately put in hazard the constitution of the sovereign power, and therefore the existence of the state itself; or, if they do in some degree affect the safety of the state, are not considered as so dangerous as to require the severe coercion of the law of treason. As, for instance, libels, and publications of that kind, though they tend to affect the safety of the state, have never been considered as of that dangerous description, when standing alone. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11793 hen, therefore, the legislature, in the 25th of Edward Srd, was called upon to define treason, it was necessary to consider what was the degree of treachery to the state which the satety of the state required should be pmines with the high penalties annexed by aw to the crime of treason
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11794 For, previous to Edward Srd’s time, the crime of treason was acrime known to the law, and its unishment was defined. The defect in the law was, that the crime itself was not so clearly defined as the safety of the subject reuired; and therefore the law was made for the safety of the subject, that those acts which were notin so great a degree dangerous to the state, should not be so penal. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11795 In the exccution of the duty which the leislature were called upon to discharge, they declared that the penalties of high treason should attach upon those who were found guilty of compassing the death of the king, and particular persons of his family; of levying war within his realm ; of adhering to tl king’s enemies, in his realm, or elsewhere ; of counterfeiting the king’s great and privy seal, and other acts of less importance
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11796 At the head of this definition, is the compassin and imagining the death of the king; suc conipesing and imagining, or purpose of the mind, being manifested by some overt act.— That is the language of our law.—Upon the construction of this law I must confess that hitherto no sort of doubt has occurred to my mind. Ithas been attempted by the counsel for the prisoner to raise a doubt upon it, and particularly by the learned gentleman who is the leading counsel for the prisoner.—It seemed to me (and, notwithstanding the explanation which he thouglit proper to give, it still seems to me) that, in so doing, he contradicted that assertion which unquestionably he made in the character of an advocate in lord George Gordon’s case, that, ‘¢ The plain, unextended letter of this act of Edward srd was thought to be a sufficient protection to the person and honour of the sovereign, and an adequate security for the laws committed to his execution.—Speaking of the statute as consisting of different and distinct members, he adds, “ I shall mention only two of the number, the other not being in the remotest degree applicable to the present accusation, To compass or imagine the death of the king ; such imagination, or purpose of the mind, visible only to its great Author, being manifested by some open act ; an institution obviously directed, not only to the sccurity of his natural person, but to the stability of the government; the life of the prince being so ine terwoven with the constitution of the state, that an attempt to destroy the one, is justly held to be a rebellious conspiracy against the other, There I make use of the words of my learned friend; and [am sure, whenever I make use of his words, 1 cannot make use of better.— 
THOMAS_HARDY 11797  ’ 
THOMAS_HARDY 11798 What is the meaning of these words 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11799 There cannot be any other than this; that a conspiracy against the life of the prince is a conspiracy against the constitution of the state, and a conspiracy against the constitution of the state is a conspiracy against the life of the prince; the life ofthe prince being so interwoven with the constitution of the state, that an attempt to destroy the one is justly held to be a rebellious conspiracy against the other.—The provision is not with a particular view to the distinct person of the man, though it is intended to preserve great reverence to whoever is upon the throne of the country, but it is because he is the king; but can it be supposed, that when the legislature was making a law upon this subject, for the express purpose of defining those crimes which should be deemed treason, it should have overlooked that sort of provision which was necessary for the preservation of the constitution of the state itself; that the law should so have remained until thisday, and that it should be necessary, in the language of my learned friend, to resort to parliament, for an act to be made upon the subject ? 
THOMAS_HARDY 11800 Gentlemen, it is absurd to suppose, that if there really had existed this defect in the law from the 25th Edward 3rd, till this time, that the defect should not have been sie, But it never yet has been understood that there did exist a defect in the law. It has been always understood that the provision of the law was adequate to its 3 that it did sufficiently protect the state ; that it has in all times, and in all instances, proved sufficient; and, therefore, the legislature has never (with this view) thought of making any farther provision upon the subject. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11801 Gentlemen, when it is considered what is the nature of the government of this country, there cannot be 2 doubt upon the subject. For, in truth, the person of the king in name, is the state itself. All the powers of the state, legislative and executive, are nominally in him. Notreally, because the king can make no law but by the advice, and with the assent of the Lords and Commons in parliament. He can execute no law but by his judges and other ministers of justice, according to a formed and regular establishment. He really does nothing, but he nominally does eve ing. The consequence is, that he is, to all intents and purposes, the sole representative of the state; and in his name every act is done. Therefore, when the security of his person was provided for, and the principle was established that that person was so inteswoven with the state itself, that they could not be separated, it necessarily followed thatthe security of the constitution of the state was provided for, in providing for the protection of his person; the sovereign power of the state never could be attacked, without attack likewise upon the person of the ing. Gentlemen, it is impossible, therefore, as it seems to me, to doubt that any altempt to subvert the constitution of the soverim power in this count to depose the king from that character whid he holds in the constitution of the soverig is, in effect, an atten: 
THOMAS_HARDY 11802 power by law established; and it has bea constantly held since the passing of that se tute uf the 25th Edward 3rd, that any attempt to depose the kia tempt against his life, under whatever pretene necessarily involves an atit may be coloured, and whether the intentxa be wholly to depose, and to put another in bs place, or to destroy monarchy itself: o merely to take from the king his sovereign authority temporarily, for some certain parposes, such an attempt has been always to be treason. Gentlemen, I cannot doubt of this, and ifit should be necessary, I am persuaded my lot, and all the judges upon the bench, will oo firm whatI say. I confess I should have bea astonished to hear this doubted, if in the pre sent age I could be astonished at a but it is the temper of the times to hold cu to the world that every thing which has bea revered for ages, is now no longer to bem vered; that the reason of man is become more powerful than it was in former times; and upon every subject new lights are to break in upon his mind; he is to be a new creature, no longer to be governed by the wisdom o former times, but to proceed entirely upon te theory of his own conceptions.Gentlemen, when my learned friend argued this point, he app to me to feel that be was so struggling with authority, that be di not know how to manage the subject; sx poses to be bound by those authorities, e at the same time prefty broadly im! an inclination to put them all aside. Yoo must recollect, however, that he did this, not simply in contradiction to the decisions courts of justice, but in truth, in contradiction to the decision of parliament itself; to the de cision of parliament in making laws, and the decision of parliament, sitting in its cial capacity, The ground upon which py learned friend has attempted to put his ment is, that the intent is the gist of th crime; and that when a man does an act D fulfilment of an intention, he must first bare conceived the intention. Now, gentlemen, by that is meant that he must have formed 8 distinct and clear purpose to do the particular act, nothing can possibly be more mistakes; not only in the case of treason, but in evey other case whatever. If a man shoots at 4. with anintent to kill him, and kills B. whoo he has no intention whatever of killing, yet is guilty of killing B. with malice aforethoust So if a man lays poison for A. and B. takes!t; anda variety of other instances there sre 2 which it is perfectly clear that a man has beea deemed guilty of a crime, which was the yo sequence of his act, although be had 50 ra tinct preconceived intent at the time, ert act should produce all the : have followedit. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11803 Gentlemen, in commenting upon this statute of the 25th Edward 3rd, my learned friend cited from lord Hale's: Pleas of the Crown several passages. Page 80 was, I think, the first that he cited, where lord Hale says— accruaching royal power was a usual charge of high treason anciently, though a wy uncertain charge, that no man could well tell what it was, nor what defence to make to it. And again in page 82, he says —“ before the statute of the 25th Edward Srd, almost every offence that was, or seemed to be a breach of the faith and allegiance due to the king, was by construction, and consequence, and interpretation, raised into the offence of high treason. For what these passages were quoted by my learned friend 1 am at a loss to guess. They seem to tme clearly to show, and were considered by Lord Hale as clearly showing, what was the tree intent of the statute of the 25th Edward Srd, that is, that such acts as did not tend in abeir consequences, te endanger the life of the ag altbough they might be deemed in fome degree accroachments of royul power, or might seem to be breaches of faith and alJegiance to the king, yet should not be deemed high treason. You will observe these are the two articles which he specifies in the two passages I have mentioned, and which before the 25th Edward Srd were raised into tthe offence of high treason. The object of the statute was, that such offences as were mot found in their consequences to endanger the life of the king, should not be deemed high treason, except (for in this the statute snakes exceptions), except that it makes some acts which im some degree are accroachmeats of royal power, or breaches of faith and allegiance to the king, though they do mot tend an their consequences to endanger the fife of the king, high treasun. What are these acts? ‘One is levying war within the realm. Now, ying war within the realm, in the sense in which these words have been constantly unaerstood, and in which it is clear from the swhole of the statute, that the words ought to De understood, may be a sort of levying war by way of resisting the king’s authority, in «ircumstances which have no view whatever to the destruction of the government of the king, but merely opposing his authority. In the particular instance of adhering to the king's enemies, the act may not have even a Temute tendency to affect the life of the king; and yet it is declared to be high treason. And so the other articles ; counterfeiting the king’s great or privy seal, or his money, &c. it is clear they could bave no possible view te the endangering the person of the king. All these acts aight seem to be in breach of faith and allegiance to the king, or coming under the other head of accroachment of eeyal power. Counterfeiting the king’s seal might be ae & acctoschunent of royal power; that is, takine u t rson who does the act, a certain accroachment of royal power ; but could not by any means whatever affect thepees of the king, and the means used could not in any degree put the king’s life in hazard. The other two, levying war, and adhering to the king’s enemies, might or might not put the king’s life in) 0 cording to circumstances; and what has been the consequence? If war is levied, or a man adheres to the king’s enemies, under such circumstances as cannot possibly affect the lite of the king, the person guilty can only be indicted upon those clauses of the statute which make levying war, or adhering to the king’s enemies, treason; but if be levy war under such circumstances as may affect the life of the king, he may be indicted upon the first of the statute for compassing the death of the king, and the levying war may be given in evidence as an overt act of that compassing. If the object of that war is such, that it may endanger the life of the king, a conspiracy to levy it is unquestionably cen treason, although the act speaks simply of levying war. And, therefore, a distinction has prevailed im the construction of the law, and the actual levying of war is Decessary to constitute the crime of high treason under circumstances that can have No tendency to touch the life of the king; but if the object is, to destroy the sovereign power, or to depose the king from the exercise of that sovereign power, or restrain him in apy manner in the exercise of it, a mere conspiracy to levy war for such purposes, is high treason within the first branch of the statute. Another passage was cited by the learned counsel from Hale; it is in page 110, in which he states and which seems to me to be directly to the point for which I have stated it, that “a conspiracy to depose the king, and manifesting this by some overt act, is an overt-act to prove the compassing the death of the king, within this act of 25th Edward 3rd, and in page 111, he says, “ compassing to depose the king is an evidence, or overt-act within the meaning of the 25th Edward 3rd. He refers to lord Coke’s Institutes, where lord Coke says—“ As if divers do conspire the death of the king, and the manner how, and thereupon provide weapons, powder, poison, array, harness, send lettcrs, e&c. or the like, for execution of the conspiracy ; also preparation by some overt-act to depose the king, or take the king by force and strong hand, and to imprison him uutil be hath yielded to certain demands ; this is a sufficient overt-act to prove the cormpasning and imagination of the death of the king. For this, upon the matter, is to make the king a subject, and to despoil him of his kingly office of royal government ; and so it was resolved by all the judges in England in 1 James 1st, in lord Cobham’s case. And so it had been resolved by ue judges in 43 Elizabeth, in the case of the earls of Essex and Southampton. And he adds that it had so fallen out in several other cases to which he refers; particularly the cases of Edward 2nd, Richard 2nd, Henry 6th, and Edward 5th, and other unfortunate kings who had reigned in this country, and who lost their lives by such conspiracies, The same doctrine, with the sme comment upon it, is also stated by lord Hale, with reference to the same cases; and sir William Blackstone, in his Commentary, considers these points as settled law. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11804 Perhaps nothing tends more clearly to illustrate a point of law, especially to persons who are not in the habits of considering points of law, than the very terms of a case which has actually happened; and in that view I will state to you the proceedings upon the trial of sir Christopher Blunt, and other per sons who were indicted with him, in 43 Elizabeth, for being concerned in that transaction of my lord Essex, which I think was -mentioned by Mr. Gibbs. Upon the arraignment of sir Christopher Blunt and sir John Davis, who were indicted for high treason, in compassing the death of the queen, they confessed that their design was, to come to the queen with so strong a force that they might Not be resisted, and to require of her divers conditions and alterations of government. This they confessed. Nevertheless they intended no personal harm to the queen herself; and that was the reason why they could not confess the whole indictment, because the indictment charged that they intended and compassed the death and destruction of the queen. Lord chief justice Popham told them—“ whenever the subject rebelleth, or riseth in a forcible manner to over-rule the royal will and power of the king, the wisdom and foresight of the laws of this land maketh this construction of his actions, that he intendeth to deprive the king both of crown and life; for the Jaw judgeth not of the fact by the intent, but of the intent by the fact. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11805 ‘0 which the queen’s counsel added ; “ this construction is no mystery or quiddity of law, but an infallible conclusion warranted by reason and experience; for the crown is not a garland, or mere outward ornament, but consists of pre-eminence and power; and, therefore, when the subject will take -upon him to give law to the king, and to “make the sovereign and commanding power become subject and commanded, such subject layeth hold on the crown, and taketh the sword out of the king’s hand. The crown is so fastened on the king’s head, that it cannot be pulled off, but head and lite will follow, as all examples, both at home and abroad, do manifest. Therefore when their words testify one thing, and their deeds another, they are like the declaration of the conspirators with Cataline, protesting their only object was their own security, that they sought nothing but just laws, and that liberty which 
THOMAS_HARDY 11806 no man would lose but with life. But admitting that the protestation of the prisoners was so far true, that they had not at that time in their minds a formed and distinct cogitation to have destroyed the queen’s person, yet there is nothing more mutable than the mind of man. When they were once alott, and had the queen in their hands, who could promise of what mind they would. then be; especially as lord Essex, upon his arraignment, defended his first action of imprisoning the privy counsellors, by pretence that he was forced to it by his unruly company. So that if themselves (that is sir Christopber Blunt and the rest) “ would not have had, or would Not seem to have had that extreme and de vilish wickedness of mind as to lay violent hands upon the queen’s sacred person, yet what must be dene to satisfy the multitude, and secure their party, must then be the question. That is, when they once had taken the measures which they meant to take, awas not in their power to say whether they would, or would not secure the queen’s lite. What must be done to satisfy their party must be then the question. Here, gentlemen, permit me to draw your attention to. something which fell from Broomhead, one of the witnesses, who when he was asked whethes there was any idea of violence or force, he disclaimed every idea of it ix Ais own mind; but be added, “ what persons might have done, if any convention had assembled, I cannot tell. A very sensible, very just, and very proper exposition of the law upon the subject. Sir Christopher Blunt, and those indicted with him, when the law had beea thus stated to them felt the force of it. They said they had entered into a deeper consideration of the matter; they were sorry they had given the Court so much trouble, but the facts of the case were perfectly clear against them, and they confessed the whole of the indictment t They were afterwards executed; and sir Christopher Blunt in his speech at his execution, said that which shows the propriety of drawing this conchge as an spfallible conclae, warranted reason and experience, in the s sid clearest ciao In his peers ai bl execution, he said, “ although it be true that, as we all protested in our examinations arraignments, we never resolved of deing burt to her majesty’s person (for in none of our consultations was there set down any such urpose) yet I kuow and must confess, if we failed. of our ends, we should, rather than have been disappointed, even have drawn blood from herself. t 
THOMAS_HARDY 11807 Now there, gentlemen, is the confession of a dying man, who felt and acknowleged, in his last moments, that although he had never formed any distinct purpose of doing any injury whatever to the Queen in the transaction which he has engaged in, yet he saw the conclusion to which it inevitably led; namely, as they could not have submitted to have been disappointed in their purpose, rather than be so disappointed, they would havedrawn blood even from their sovereign. It strikes me that nothing can more cleaily demonstrate what is the true construction of this law than the bare narration of the case I have now cited. It shows that those who have construed the law in the manner in which I have Stated it, have construed it by drawing infallible conclusions warranted by reason and experience. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11808 Gentlemen, the cases which are mentioned by lord Coke by name only, the case of Henry 4th deposing Richard ad, and Edward 4th deposing Henry 6th show that the humbleness ofthe demand at the Epaniag of ascheme of this sort may often lead to the most dreadful consequences, When the wife of Edward 2d conspired against her husband, and came over tothis country with her infant son, her pretence was, that it was only against evil counsellors. In consequence of that declaration, numbers ined her, who were discontented with the bars government, unquestionably with very considerable reason. hat was the result? The moment she had raised this power, she got the great seal into her hands, she issued writs for summoning a parliament in the king’s name, without his authority, and in his absence; that parliament when it met, acting without the king’s authority, was in effect in the nature of a convention; and they resolved to depose the king, and place his son in his stead. In consequence of this resolution, they compelled the king to make a resignation of his crown, which was in no degree voluntary; and they placed his son upon the throne. They had no intention to touch the king’s life; but those who were more deeply involved in the conspiracy, the leaders om it, knew that this life was utterly inconsistent with their safety; andin a very few months, they contrived that he should be put to a most cruel death. hat was the case of Richard 2nd; was it not the same thing; and when we talk of the means by which a conspiracy is to be effected, we know that Henry 4th, when he first landed at Ravenspurg, had but twenty-six men. He came, relying upon the popular discontents within the kingdom, and was upon the point of guing back. again ; but being joined by a large body of pools the king was deposed, and put to death. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11809 Therefore you are not to imagine that a distinct cogitation, or intention to destroy the king, is necessary to constitute the crime of treason. If the act proposed to be done is that which in its consequences leads, accord- ing to ordinary experience, to the death of the king, or at least to endanger his life, the act is in substance high- treason. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11810 Of the persons who formed the convention in France, for the purpose of establishing a government, such as itnow is, probably when they deposed the king a great number had no idea of touching his life. We know it was a aestion extremely agitated among them, and here are strong reasons to believe that the majority of them, if they had been free agents, would never have consented tothatact. But the question, after they had deposed the king, was not what they would do, but (as was observed in the case of sir Christopher Blunt) what must be done, to satisfy the multitude, and secure themselves. The moment they entered into those ,measures, they were no longer free agents, the could no longer control their own acts, and the consequence was the death of the king. ‘ 
THOMAS_HARDY 11811 Gentlemen, this dessins is also laid down with equal clearness in a book which has been cited by my learned friend, and which appears to me to demonstrate the impossibility of putting any other construction upon the statute. The manner in which the author states it, is thus—“ The care which the law hath taken for the personal safety of the king is not confined to actions or attempts of a more flagitious kind ; such as attempts either to assassinate or to poison, or other attempts, directly and immedjately aiming at his life. It is extended to ¢very thing, wilfully and deliberately done or attempted, whereby his life may be endangered. And, therefore, the entering into measures for deposing or imprisoning him, or to get his person into the power of the conspirators, these offences are overt acts of treason, within this branch of the statute. For experience hath shown, that, between the prisons and the graves of kings, the distance is very small. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11812 Gentlemen, this is the language of a man, who has, in general, been considered as extremely correct upon this subject, sir Michael Foster, who was well known to many persons now living. He was considered as a man as little disposed to stretch the law, upon any subject, as any man that ever sat upon the bench ; but he saw and felt, that the real meaning of this statute was, to provide for the safety ot the constitution of the state, and for the safety of the person of the king, because he was the head of that constitution; and be-. cause, in providing for the safety of the king, the law necessarily provided also for the safety of that constitution ; the crown being so fixed on the king's head, that it could not be pulled off, but head and life would follow. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11813 I have, therefore, been much at a loss to collect upon what ground my learned friend could assert, that nothing could be a compassing the death of the king, under the statute of Edward Srd, but what would amount toa compassing the death of any other man, under the common law. He attributed this assertion to sir Michael Foster; but, with submission to him, sir Michael Fosterasserts no such thingin the passage to which my friend alluded. He is speaking only of the form of the indictment ; and itis perfectly clear, that the case of the king, and the case cf an individual, are in no degree parallel. For when the mere imagining the death of a man, accompanied with an overt act, was deemed, in law, asa homicide, it never entered into the idea of any. man that, to remove a man from his office, or imprison him, were overt acts of compassing his every authority, are overt acts of compassing the death of the king, within the meaning of the statute. The reason of this difference is clear. In the case of the king, deposing him, imprisonment, or any coercion of that kind tends to his death, with relation to his political character, because he is king, and for no other reason. You cannot use the term deposition to a private person, nor can imprisonment merely have any tendency in itself whatever to his death. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11814 My learned friend stated another passage, from lord Hale, page 95, with respect to the statute of Richard the and. At the time he read that passage, I apprehend he had the book in his hand. If not, he had certainly omitted to take from the book the passage which immediately follows. For, if he had stated both, he could not have mentioned the first passage, so as to raise any doubt in your minds. For lord Hale expressly states, that the statute of Richard 2nd, was merely for the purpose of making additional forfeiture of lands, and a new mode of trial; and adding some other circumstances in the four cases of treason, mentioned in the statute, all of which he states as being actually treason, within the statute a Nanerd ant and one of them is leposing the king. it perfectly appears, that oat Hale naire the mutte Gr the 
THOMAS_HARDY 11815 11 Richard 2nd, as in no degree affecting the original law upon the subject, and as intended to introduce only additional severe provisions, to establish a new unheard-of mode of trial, and to add some other circumstances; all of which it was thought proper, by a subsequent etatute of the 4 enry 4th entirely to sweep away. Gentlemen, I mentioned to you, that the -‘Tegislature had, both in its legislative and in its judicial capacity, given precisely the same determination upon the subject. The statute of the 7 William Srd, limiting the time for indictments for treason, excepts, by particular words, persons designing, endeavouring, or attempting an assassi the king, by poison, or otherwise; but does th. But those acts, according to ; 
THOMAS_HARDY 11816 ination on the body of not generally except treason in compassing the death of the king; so that the framers of that statute must necessarily have conceived, that there existed cases which were (withn the meaning of the5 Edward 3rd) compassing the death of the king, and did not come within the meaning of assassination, or any such attack immediately upon the person of the king. And in prosecutions by impeach ment, in lord Lovat’s case, and lord Wintoun’s caset where the charge has been of treason, in compassing the death of the king, the same decisions have been made. In lord Wintoun’s case, sir Joseph Jekyll (who has generally been understood to have been as constitutional a lawyer, and as a whig, as any that ever existed) states the law thus: “a conspiracy to levy war, with intent depose the king, is treason; and such a conspiracy, to levy such a war, has been held to be an overt act of compassing and imagining the death of the king. He then speaks another overt act alleged, which was lord rintaiia's forcing with others, in proclaiming the pretender: “ which, says he, “is endesvouring to set up another prince, in the room of his majesty, and I believe it will not be doubted, but that is likewise an overt act the same species of treason; and if there wanted another overt act, the levying war against the king, with intent to depose him (which is likewise mentioned ip the articlesas a distinct species of treason) may serve for an overt act of the other species of Fon tbouge and imagining the king’s death. For, it is reckoned in the statute as a distinct treason, yet it doth not thereby cease to be of the nature of an overt act of compassing and imagining the king’s death, which it wassatecedent to its being declared a sshinet pets: and this point is likewise supported by authorities, and many attainders have been upon it.’t 
THOMAS_HARDY 11817 This was declared, by sir Joseph Jekyll, oa behalf of all the commons of England, on the impeachment of lord Wintoun, before House of Lords ; and lord Wintoun was guilty of treason upon that impeachment; and judgment being propounesd against him, the ing as the head of the commonwealth, issued his warrant upon such judgment, for the execution of lord Wintoun. In that deci sion, you have, therefore, the three branches of the legislature, in their respective capacities, giving precisely the same construction of the act, which is now contended for.Gentlemen, the assertion, that, if persons had conspired to seize (for instance) king pileets penton, setariee tat ae b one. Holland, express ing, ey int ed no hela fie yernonn they would not jn ea nisi avail einenDae i sir Joseph Je! openingp. 831. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11818 have been guilty of treason, seems to me very extraordinary. In the assassination plot it appeared, upon the evidence, that the intention to kill the king was only in case the eonspirators could not secure bis person. Their design was not to kill him, but to endeavour to secure his person, and send him out of the country ; and it was only in case they should not be able to secure his person, that they meant to assassinate him. In Layer’s case it was expressly proved, that the design to seize the King’s person, was not for the purpose of killing him, but in order to protect him from insult. The intention of the party was, to make the pretender king, and to seize the person of George 1st, for the purpose of sending him back to Hanover. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11819 In lord Cobham’s case, in the reign of James 1st, the conspiracy was, to seize the king’s person indeed; but not with any view of deposing him (except by depriving him of power fora time) nor for the purpose of injuring his person, in any degree whatever, but for the purpose only of compelling him to assent to the general toleration of the Roman Catholic religion in this country, and to certain acts, intended to be proposed for that purpose. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11820 Gentlemen, under these circumstances I shall take the law to be perfectly clear, that, if a conspiracy is iret to despoil the king of his kingly office, and the exercise of his authority, in such manner as the spirit of the constitution requires, it is a eonspit to depose the king, and therefore it is high treason in compassing the death of the king. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11821 Gentlemen, it has been next insisted, that the nature of the evidence required to prove high treason is different from that which is required in any other case, by force of the word ‘ provably,’ used in the statute of Edward Srd, and that, therefore, the evidence must be direct and plain. I conceive, in this respect, the evidence required is exactly the same 4s in other criminal cases, with the addition only of this circumstance, that there must be two witnesses, at the least; that is, either two witnesses to one overt act, or one witness to one overt act, and another witness to another overt act, of the same species of treason. With respect to any other distinction, in point of evidence, I have found no authority whatever. Ifthe minds of the j are not really satisfied ; if the evidence will Not produce reasonable conviction in their minds, in no criminal case ought a verdict of ilty to be pronounced. But if the minds of the jury are really satisfied; if the evidence would produce reasonable conviction in the case of a murder, of a robbery, or of any other crime, the verdict ought to be precisely the same, in the case of treason, as in any other case, seq. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11822 Another objection which has been raised is, that the evidence has been carried to so great a length. ‘It is perfectly immaterial, whether the evidence is long or short, with respect to the effect it should have when it is complete; whether you come to a conclusion by the proof of many circuynstances, or by the proof of only one; for, if the conclusion and result of the whole is a conviction, in your own minds, of the guilt or innocence of the person accused, the consequence must necessarily be the sang. ‘ 
THOMAS_HARDY 11823 In cases of treason the evidence has often been very extensive, but certainly in no ease so extensive as it has been in this. In lord Strafford’s case, however, which was a ease of impeachment, the evidence was very extensive, and took up a considerable length of time; and lord Coke, in that book which Mr. Erskine cited with so much respect, observes, that the compassing, intent, or imagination of the king’s death, in a case of this species of treason, though secret, is to be tried by the 
THOMAS_HARDY 11824 Ts; meaning the jury; and to be discovered yy circumstances, precedent, concomitant, and subsequent. By such circumstances you are to discover the intent; and then you are to apply that intent to the particular acts which are all as overt acts of treason, if they do not in their very nature demonstrate the intent itself. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11825 Considering the law to be clear, I will now state the nature of the conspiracy charged It is not a simple conspiracy to destroy the life of the king upon the throne, and aiming only at him; cat it is a conspiracy (as it has been attempted to be proved), in effect, to destroy monarchy altogether; in the language of one of the letters which has been read to you, to rip up monarchy by the roots, and plant democracy in its stead. And I conceive that this is to be drawn by fair conclusion from the facts demonstrating a treasonable conspiracy. An intent to cearoy the monarchy, and an act in pursuance of that inten demonstrate the intent to compass the deat of the king, as plainly as an intent to rob fs demonstrated by a man’s coming up with a pistol to your carriage, and showing that he as the power, or that he conceives he has it, to take from you your money. In such cases, without even demanding your money, if the thing were intended to be done, and means were taken for the purpose, the nature of the attack is utterly unimportant to the question of guilty or not guilty—it is unimportant borrowing, as I may do for this purpose, the nguage of one of the Scots delegates, Mr. Gerrald) whether the life of the king is to be endangered by a robber on the heath, or by associated clubs; and —I think that the latter is far more dangerous. History tells us that thieves have respected the persons of sovee reigns, that they have felt for fallen greatness, which popular conventions never have done. ee EEE 
THOMAS_HARDY 11826 Gentlemen, I was repeatedly called upon by my learned friend opposite to me, in his address to you, to state the point of time when the prisoner first conceived the criminal intention imputed to him—my answer is, that it is perfectly immaterial when it was first conceived. The question is, did he ever conceive it; and if he did, and acted in pursuance of an intent so conceived, he is guilty of high treason, although the intent is not necessarily a distinct intent to destroy the king, but an intent to do any act which might endanger his life, by any probable consequences. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11827 Now, gentlemen, has the evidence produced to you, shown any fact from which it may be 
THOMAS_HARDY 11828  fairly concluded, that there has been a conspiracy to take measures in consequence of which the king’s life might be put in hazard ; and has the prisoner done any act or acts, in furtherance of such design? I think when the evidence is attended to, that there can be no doubt upon the subject. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11829 The atlorney geteral in his opening, stated a case, in which he attributed to several’ persons, and particularly to the leaders of these two societies (of both of which the defendant 
THOMAS_HARDY 11830 ‘was a member, and to one of which he was secretary) one general object, which they considered as a common cause with other secieties, and with all the friends of liberty, in all countries : the establishment of a representative government, founded on the principles of the Rights of Man—and he likewise attributed to them, a general pursuit of means, for the accomplishment of that object—first by ccllestening the peuple, and secondly by assembling a convention (or meeting, or whatever name you choose to give it, for there is no magic in the word convention) which should assume the character of a convention of the people. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11831 That is the material point—a convention which should assume the character ofa convention of the people, fora convention of the people on the iprueiples ofthe Rightsof Man, must necessarily be sovereign. What are the people? 
THOMAS_HARDY 11832 ‘Fhe natural power is in the hands of the multitude; the forceremains withthem. Iftherefore those whohave the natural force are to be called intoaction by the assembling ofa meeting which is to assume the authority of a convention of the people, the whole people are called into action, and government is necessarily dissolved. There is an end of all government; every constitution must fall before such a power; because it is the people themselves, taking back into their own hands, that power which they had before delegated—I do not pretend to state principles contrary in that respect to what these societies have stated— that power which the people in all countries must be considered as having deleted. But the moment persons are assemled who take upon themselves the character of a convention of the people, upon every principle bat must be, if they are what they assume to be, sovereign: and if they are not what they assume to bg, still if they assume to be a convention of the people, they assume to be sovereign. Gentlemen, if this is clear, the end these persons wished to obtain ws necessarily the deposition of the king, ani something to be done in consequence of it It does not absolutely follow of necessity, that the monarchy should be destroyed, and thata representative government should be eublished ; for it is possible that the conventica of the people so assembled might deliberate with wisdom upon the subject, might be of opinion that the monarchy was still the bet form of government, limited in some way other, and might therefore form a consttr tion which in its nature should be monarch cal. But whether ed should do so or not, still the deposition of the king would be in te interim as complete, as if they had actualy destroyed him. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11833 Gentlemen, the principles adopted by these clubs, give very little room for hope that ifs convention of the people should have bea assembled, acting upon those Principes, they would have established a monarchical & vernment. For, gentlemen, those princip! (which they have repeatedly declared, in the evidence that has been laid before you, at principles never to be departed from) are ist “the Le of equal active citizenship, or te right of every individual to an equal share a the government of that society of which hes amember. And here, gentlemen, I beg leave to observe a very clear : distinction between their plan and what is called the duke of Richmond’s plan— duke of Richmond's plan never asserted ay such right of every individual to an equl share in the government of the society which he is a member. All that his plo went to, was simply this—an equal share m the constitution of that body of represeottives who should act in the manner in which the House of Commons does in this country, in the legislature of the country—a thing different as light and darkness, from an equal share in the government of the society which he is a member—and yet you will hot, throughout the resolutions of these perso that constantly the right of active citizenship, the right of universal representation, is appl? to the whole government, and is not confined, a any one instance (at least I have not f one) to such a body as the House of Commons is in this country. This right to an ¢q share in the government, is the necessil] consequence and result of that pe He upon which they assert the right of equal scuve citizenship ; and it cannot be questioned, thst the moment you assume that every ms2 FI a right to an equal share in the government which he is a member, the moment you take that as a principle, all the rest must sarily follow. iat, bit 
THOMAS_HARDY 11834 The next assertion of these societies 5the exercise of that right of equal active tizenship in appointing an adequate repre 
THOMAS_HARDY 11835  tative government, is essential to the security of that very right of equal active citizenship. So it unquestionably is; because in no manner but by the election of all those with whom power is entrusted, can every individual enjoy the right of equal active citizenship. But if there are to be peers, and aking in the conn there cannot be equal active citizenship. If the king and peers are to have a distinction, however small it may be, they cannot be equal active citizens with the rest. You must perceive, therefore, that the moment it is established as a principle, that there is a right in every individual to an equal share in the wernment of the society to which he belongs, monarchy falls to the ground, because itis utterly inconsistent with that peinciple ; and you will recollect, that in the books which have been produced to you, this is laid down asa very clear consequence from the principle; and it is asserted, that there was a manifest contradiction in the French constitution of 1791, because, having established the pricciple, it still retained a king in its form of government. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11836 There was another objection I recollect, to this French constitution, resulting from the same principles. That all persons ought to be deemed equally qualified to vote for the election of a representative body, however small their property ; so that every individual ought to have an equal right ofvoting. Having established, therefore, the right of every individual to an equal share in the government of the society of which he is a member, and the exercise of that right in appointing an adequate representative government, they necessarily claim, as one of the rights of man, in the third place,“ The right of universal suffrage and annual parliaments ;? — And this, not itheas a wise regulation, but as necessarily included in the constitution of a representative Prraurent formed on their fae — tis stated by Mr. Paine and Mr. Barlow, that a government in which those rights are withheld, is an usurpation of the rights of man; and so it necessarily is, if these authors are right in their first principles
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11837 This original and continual right of universal suffrage is also a necessary consequence of the right of equal, active citizenship; because that equality must necessarily fe destroyed by long delegation of either legislative or executive power; and therefore the delegation must be renewed as often as circumstances will admit.A fourth necessary consequence is, the right of perpetual revolution. The right of ging their constitution and government, when, as often, and in what manner they may think proper ; still, necessarily, according to their principles, adhering to some form of Tepresentative government, frequently to be renewed; because any fourm of government, which is not a representative government, and is not frequently renewed, is necessarily contrary to the right of equal, active citizenship; and it therefore is,.according to their principles, an usurpation of the indefeasible tights of man, and is unlawful—tyranny— despotism—or is liable to any other of the harsh appellations which they are pleased to apply to every existing government in the world.— —Gentlemen, this conclusion is inevitable from the principle which they assume, of equal, active citizenship—I certainly will not here dispute-with them the truth of their assumption, whether it is well or ill founded. I think it would be no very difficult task to prove that it is ill-founded; and for this reason, if for no other, that it necessarily leads to persue! and constant revolution. But, without entering into any discussion upon the subject, it is sufficient that these are no principles, nor ever have been conceived to be principles, in the English constitution: They are utterly inconsistent with monarchy ; they are utterly inconsistent with a House of Lords, and with many other parts of our establishment; and therefore, persons who at. tempt to procure the establishment of these principles, as principles upon which the constitution and government of this country ought to be founded, and who hold that any government founded upon other principles, is necessarily an usurpation of their indefeasible rights, if they take any steps whatever for the purpose of altering the established government, they must be conceived, prime facie, to have within their view the intent of destroying the existing government, of abolishing the kingly office, of abolishing the House of Lords, and all the great officers, ranks, and distinctions in this country; of abolishing also the House of Commons, as it is now established, and of forming a constitution of government upon their own principles because no other constitution of government can, according to the tenets which they hold, be a lawful government. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11838 Now, gentlemen, it is proved that persons holding these principles, had formed a design for assembling a convention or meeting, which should assume the character of a convention of the people; that in the prosecution of this design, they did various acts; and particularly, that the prisoner at the bar did various acts—writing letters, being present at meetings and a variety of other acts, all tending to the completion of this purpose. A case so proved, must necessarily -amount fo high treason, because it is impossible that the conception should have been formed for assembling a convention under such circumstances, without those who formed it conceiving in their minds a wish and purpose to destroy the existing government, and to establish in its place a government founded on principles totally opposite to those on which the existing government is founded. —When such persons assemble for the purpose of effecting a reformation in the government of the country, it is fairly to be presumed, in the first iustance, that they do it for the pur of carrying into effect those principles Phich hey fave so laid dowa; and if they attempt this by means of a meeting which is to assume the character of a convention of the by the very act of assembling a meeting which is to assume that character, they declare completely, that such is their intention, because the convention, if truly a convention of the people, cannot be assembled without the possession of abbas power. It certainly is not necessary that the purse which is imputed to the prisoner in this indictment, should be proved to its full extent, in order to F ee finding him guilty. But I apprehend that it has been 90 proved. A much less case seems to me to bring the isoner withia the penalties of high treason. Fr hes been shown, at least, that those per sens who were concerned with him, had formed a design to procure some alteration in the constitution of the sovereign power of the state, and that they lad taken some steps for that purpose. —If they formed a design of procuring any alteration, otherwise than by acts of the constituted legislature, of the King, Lords, and Commons, in parliament assembled, and acting in perfect freedom ; for if they do not act in pereect freedom, they ate not the constituted legislature ef the country—it is ridiculous to ‘call them 0, if they are put under restraint—if a man is put restraint, any act which he does is void —if he is compelled to do it, it is not his act and so with respect to abe legislature; if they are not free agents, they are not the comstituted legislature—they are not that thing which was intended by the framers of the constitution of the couatry to be that body which should make laws to bind the rest of the people
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11839 Then, if these persons formed a design of procuring any alteration ef the constitution, otherwise than by means of the constituted legislature, acting as free agents, they formed a design to depose the king from his royal authority ; and that deposition is, if 1am sight in the lawIhave stated, compassing the death of the king; and this being manifested by any act in pursuance of the design, the measure of their guilt was full ; they were guilty of high treason—for, if any y is attempted to be made in the constitution of the sovereign power of a state, otherwise than by its own authority, from the mement the attempt begins to operate, the constituted sovereign power of the state ceases to be such, is deposed from its authority, at least to ihe extent necessary to effect the particular change. The law of England admits of no distiaction between the deposition of the king :for a day or an hour, and his deposition for ever. The guilt of high treason attaches to the first, as well as to the last; for an attempt to de the king his sovereign authority, ig day hour, must-hazard his life—A conspiracy for shat purpose is, ing: hi death, and is high treasom, oran 
THOMAS_HARDY 11840 In the case of lord Cobham, it was not the view of the persons who were conceme, that the acts which they proposed to &, should, for any continuance, deprive the kn of his royal authority; but they conceive that, within e certain time (according to m Tecollection of the circumstances, witkz about a month) they should be able to efx. tuate their pi 3 and that they shou have brought about all they meant to bart done, in the mean time, in the king’s num And yet there was ne doubt that that ona deposition of the king, if it bad beefected only for the short time during wha they meant to effect it, would have bea z commpletely high treason as if they hadtended to depose him for ever. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11841 Admitting that the persons whe were om cerned in this business, intended to bre made a change in the goverament of ts country, the idea of electing the change ly means of the existing legislature (if yoo attend at all to what the evidence has bees! seems quite out of the question.

UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11845 They had a bill framed, intended to be introduced into parliament; they applied to parliament upon the subject, and a bill was brought into parliament.

THOMAS_HARDY 11847 id particular stress upon some words made use of in one of the resolutions for the purpose of assembling those meetings, from which he intimated that their object was only to collect the opinions of the people upon the subject, or to take means to consider what were the proper measures for the purpose
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11848  But, gentlemen, when one recollccts all that they have declared uponthe subject; when one recollects that they have repeatedly declared that the people were not to look for relief from the parliament, as it was constituted ; that it was not to be expected of those who were in le; when they declared they derers, and oppressors; I can conceive no words, than that of considering in what manner they should obtain a reform by means of 
THOMAS_HARDY 11849 But, suppose they had not had it in their view to have acted immediately themselves as aconstituting assembly, though assuming the character of a convention of the people, which I think I shall show you they clearly Meant to do, as the British Convention expressly did—I cannot understand why they Were not to act—did they propose to meet. with a view to suggest. se idea of calling any other meeting upon tH subject, or to do anyfarther act
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11850 If they did not intend to submitthemselves to the established legislature of the country, their act was necessarily an act of usurpation of the sovereign power; and if they were simply devising the means by which the people, at any future time, were by their own power to do this for themsclves, it is exactly the same thing as if this Convention, had it been assembled, should themselves do it.—They would be only doing it more remotely; but they would be taking steps towards effecting their own original design— that of making a change in the existing government, by their own power, and not by the free power of the existing legislature — Gentlemen, if they had conceived this particular desizn, still I conceive their proceedings would have been equally destnictive to the existing government; for the mcans taken for the purpose, must be all tending to effect the pa plan which they had in view, and which they clearly meant te effect by their own strength, and not by any such applica. tion to the legislature as has been contended. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11851 Gentlemen, when you consider what has passed in France, you must be perfectly aware of the effects of a national constituted assembly. When the states general of France were called together by the king, before half of them were assembled, such of them, who were principally of the third order, as were assembled, declared themselves to be a national assembly ; that is, an assembly of the people; and they immediately declared that according to that principle, namely, that they were an assembly of the people, the king could put no negative upon their proceedings. That was one of the first measures of that assembly; and the moment they had done so, it’ is evident to every person who has looked at all into the history of that country, that the king of France was, in effect, deposed from that very moment (I think the 7th of June, 1789) by less than a mvuiety of the whole assembly intended to be convened, meeting together, and assuming the character of a convention of the people; declaring themselves a national assembly, and that the ing could put no negative upon their proceedings, and that they would not separate till they had effected their purpose. They immediately took upon them to act as the sovereign power of the country; they took upon them to declare that all the existing taxes were illegal; that those taxes should be received for a time, but should onty be received so long as that assembly should sit, From that moment, therefore, in effect the king of France was deposed; a constitution was afterwards formed, and to that constitution he gave his assent in 1791. He was then again upon the throne; but upon which throne he was not king in the character which he had before, but he was king by a perfectly new title, and in a perfectly new character. Such is the necessary course, and such the necessary consequence of a national constituted assembly. If you look to what has passed in your own country, and to that which is so continually referred to in the course of these proceedings, namely, the Revolution in 1688, you will find, to a certain extent, the same thing done; for what was that assembly which pe the prince and princess of Orange on the throne
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11852 King James having done that which occasioned a general rising of his subjects against him, he deserted the country, and an assembly was - called, under no regular authority, but under letters similar to those which had been used for the purpose of calling together the persons who were entitled to be summoned to parliament, and letters directed to the sheriffs of the several counties, to cause elections to be made by the persons entitled to vote for members tu be returned to parliament. That assembly met —in what character? It met as a convention of all the estates and degrees of the people; it acted as such ; its authority was acquiesced in, and it did all that was necessary for its particular purpose. The government of the country remained as it was, with the exception of one single circumstance—the throne was vacant—the Convention supplied that vacancy ; and from the moment it had supplied the vacancy, by declaring the prince and princess of Orange king and queen, from that Anstant, its character as a convention ceased ; it was no longer an assembly which represented the three estates of the realm, it was assumed by William to act as a regular parliament, and from that time acted as such, shaving before acted as a mere convention or assernbly of the three estates; in consequence of which, when acting as a parliament, it was commonly called the Convention Parliament. But in the act of giving the crown to thePtince of Orange, it acted with complete sovereign power, and acted in rebellion, if I May so term it, to James the 2nd; for he would have been completely deposed the mo‘Ment that convention assembled,. if he had not previously abdicated the throne ; and this aS a necessary consequence of assembling such a species of convention. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11853 Gentlemen, the moment, therefore, as I conceive, that there is an-assembly assuming to itself the character of a convention of the people, and able to sustain itself against the government of the country, there is an insurFection against that government, and all those consequences follow which are so fully detailed in that speech of Barrere, which was read to you—the king is immediately deposed, and deprived of his inviolability, so far asa convention has power to act. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11854 Now, gentlemen, if a meeting which could assume the title of aconvention of the people, could lawfully assemble themselves, what must be the consequence? If the meeting is really a convention of the people, and it be lawful for them to assemble, the king must be bound 
THOMAS_HARDY 11855 ‘to obcy; he is no longer sovereign, or the head of the sovereign power ; the parliament must also be bound: to obey this convention. Being in its nature the sovereign power of the state, resistance to its authority must be resistance to the sovereign power of the state; for the moment the meeting assembled, it must be the sovereign power, and the king, in the very act of resisting the authority of such an assembly, if it could afterwards sustain itself, must be guilty himself of what might be deemed treason against the sovereign power of the state; he would be resisting the power which he ought to obey, and the assembly would have a pretence for putting him to death; the very same pretence as in ie case of king Charles 1st. If, therefore, it appears to you that these persons had formed a conspiracy to assemble a number of persons who should assume, when assembled, the character of a convention of the pedple, a that they had taken steps for that purpose; that alone would constitute the crime of high treason. Gentlemen, the conspiracy which has ber alleged is of a very wide and extensive petur: a eireumstance which has occasioned a consderable degree of complaint on the part of m learned friends, as it has produced very tensive evidence. The persons concerae! have been actingat different times in differen: places, and sometimes, perhaps, by difiert! means, but allof them havingin view, as ce ceive (when I say all, I mean the leaders), grand plan, the accomplishment of which m the object of all. This has occasioned th distribution of the evidence into those tm parts noticed by Mr. Gibbs, which were po duced to establish, first, the existence of te general conspiracy; and secondly, the ja which the prisoner had in it. I conceive tat when you consider. the evidence taken als ther, you can have no sort of doubt of boti Gentlemen, let me take the evidencea Ix: by degrees ; and in so doing, as I see there w: be no end in taking it in detail, I shall nee sarily trust to your giving some creditto ar assertion, without referring to every partol evidence, expecting his lordship will sf wards sum it up more in detail to you. Fra the several publications and papers gveo 4 evidence, I think I may assume it to be pe fectly clear, that there were some persons this country—and I will instance Mr. Pane. and Mr. Barlow, who were desirous of efi«ing the general destruction of the British Lo stitution, and particularly of monarchy, a all hereditary honours ; and who were dsxed to promote, to the utmost of their por any measures for that purpose. T think, ges tlemen, you cannot have attended to the edence, without admitting that Ido notsssam too much, when I assume that it cannot bs fairly contended that such persons as Parse and Barlow were not, in effect, conspinior against the constitution of this cout’. Lhere were persons also in Franceho cot under the same description, and particulars (with great submission) I shall venture 0 clude in that description the French Nato Convention ; for they were clearly disposed establish that doctrine here, which ee established in their own country, but which is directly adverse to the British Constituls?: and they were desirous of doing it for be son, because they felt that their own salt! depended upon it. You will recollect re haps, a passage in Paine’s work, whi a was read; “ When France sball bearounded with revolutions, she Cot peace and safety. And the Society for Co. stitutional Information, and the Lo te responding Society, accordingly addres 198, National Convention in 2} overnber er (which, by-the-by, neither of the coun: the prisoner at the bar took any ip whatever, though they appeared ve tant papers, forthe purpose of showing the intention of these people); You will recollect that the London Corresponding Society, in particular, “ fervently supplicated the Almighty Ruler of the Universe to be favourable to the cause of the French, so intimately blended with their own. This you will recollect was not during the existence of the Constitution of 1791, but after the destruction of that constitution, and the total deposition of Louis 16th; and then they considered the cause of the French as intimately blended with their own. How could it be blended with their own, unless it was their object to establish in this country a government upon the same principles upon which the French had established their government, or were endeavouring to establish a government? They conceived “ that it was their duty to countenance and assist, to the utmost of their power, the champions of human happiness ; that they would therefure oppose, to the utmost of tlicir power, any thing hostile to them on the part of Great Britain; and they looked to the triple alliance of the people of America, France, and Britain to give freedom to the world. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11856 Gentlemen, the words which are made use of, are very strong; for it is not simply “ of the people, but they are—“ If you succeed, as we ardently wish, the triple alliance (not of crowns, but) of the people of America, France and Britain, will give peace to Europe, and freedom to the whole world. Therefore they did not simply make use of the word “ people, an expression that might comprehend the whole; but they expressly negatived crowns. There existed no crown in America —at that time none in France; the only country mentioned in this paper which had a crown was Great Britain. Therefore when they ardently wished a triple alliance, not of crowns, but of the people of America, France and Britain, to give peace to the whole world, what do they do but in terms, not to be controverted, declare, that it is their wish and intention —that is, that they had formed a conspiracy, for I do not know what a conspiracy is, but forming a wish and intention to do a thing—that they had formed a wish and intention of establishing a government in this country without acrown? I can give it no Other interpretation. In another part of their address they say—secking our real enemies, we find them in our bosoms. We feel ourselves inwardly torn by, and ever the victims of, a restless and all consuming aristucracy, hitherto the bane of every nation under the sun. Wisely have you acted in expelling it from 
THOMAS_HARDY 11857 France, Why, gentlemen, what do they mean by “ aristocracy here? Whatcan they possibly mean but to refer to that part of the constitution in the government of this country which may be deemed aristocratical 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11858 do not they declare in that passage, that they consider every thing to which they can give the denomination of aristocracy, as their real enemics ; that they consider it as the bane of every nation under the sun; and, therefore, they conceived the French had acted wisely in expelling it from France? It must have been their opinion that it would be equally wise to expel’ it from this country. For what purpose could this address be presented to the French Con-: vention? There might be two purposes ; one that of publishing to the country here, in a way which they might fancy to be in some’ degree safc, a declaration against the existing government of the country; a sort of procla-’ mation of a republic; and another, a holding out to the French Convention, that they were: desirous of receiving every assistance from that. country which could possibly be given, for the purpose of enabling those who addressed them to establish the same constitution of gavernment in this country, as had been established in France. ’ The Address which was presented by the other society, the Society for Constitutional Information, is full as strong. You observe, the learned counsel for the prisoner have cautiously avoided taking any notice ofthisaddress, In truth, they were unable to give any explanation of it. How does this address begin? “ Servants of a Sovereign People, and Benefactors of Mankind,—We rejoice that your Revolution has arrived at that point of perfection, which will permit us to address you by this: title. The degree to which, as they conceive, a Revolution must arrive to be at its point of perfection, is, when those who have the administration of the government of the country, are to be addressed in the character: in which they thus address the French Con-: vention; that is, “Servants of a Sovereign People. What is this but a declaration, that the perfection 6f a Revolution in government, is the establishment of the principles, which we have before adverted to, of the Rights of. Man, and equal citizenship, and so on, ia which the people are to be considered as constantly sovereign as constantly exerting the sovereign authority, and as having a perpetual control over the whole government of the country; not an indirect and remote control; that species of control, which: is consistent with the stability of the gaovernment of a country; but that which leads, in its principle, to the sort of perpetual Revolution, upon which I have before observed ? The address proceeds, “ We rejoice that your Revolution has arrived at that point of perfection, which will permit us to address you by this title; it is the only one that can accord with the character of true legislators. Is not this a clear and express declaration, that they did not consider the legislature of this country, as having that title which could accord with the character of true legislators ? For no reform in the House of Commons; alone, could give to the legislators of this country, a title to that character, according to the idea of these persons upon the gubject. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11859 For the King and House of Lords, still remaining parts of the legislature, and being hereditary, could not, by any possibility, come within that description which they meant to attribute to the French Convention
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11860 They add, “ Every successive epoch in your affairs has added something to the eels of Liberty ; and the glorious victory of the 10th of August, has finally prepared the way for a conStitntion, which, we trust, you will establish on the basis of Reason and Nature. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11861 Gentlemen, I have nothing to do with the propriety or impropriety of the conduct of those who were concerned in the transactions ofthe 10th of August. It would be wrong for me to blame one side or the other. But to which ever side blame was imputable, v-hat was the event? ‘The event was the destruction of monarchy. ‘That is here called a glorious Victory ; it is said to have finally prepared the way for a constitution, which the society trusted would be established on the basis of Teason and nature; it had brought them to that situation which enabled them to arrive, finally, at that point of. perfection, expressed in the former part of the address. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11862 Now, gentlemen, to say that any persons who could give their assent to that Address knowing what they were about, or attending to it, entertained a sincere attachment to any of the principles upon which the British constitution is founded, is asserting that which it secins to me, that no rational man can possibly ive credit to. I cannot help here observing, by the way, upon the words,— Finally prepared the way for a constitution, which, we trust, you will establish on the basis of reason and nature. gentlemen, you will recollect there were two passages; onc in Mr. Paine’s work, the other in Juel Barlow’s, before this glorious victory of the 10th of August, which expressly stated, that they looked to that event; to the destruction of the constitution which had been formed in 1791, for this reason; because it was formed in contradiction to the Principles of the Rights of Man, in the parts of it which consisted of a monarch, or any thing in the nature of distinctions of privileged orders. ‘That so far as it had any sort of distinction whatever, and was not compietely founded upon the right of equal active citizenship, it was a compound of contradictions, as, I think, Paine calls it in his publication, the Rights of Man, and therefore in its nature it could not subsist. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11863 In another passage of the same address, speaking of the cause of the i'rench, they say, “It is, indeed, a sacred cause. We ehcrish it, as the pledge of your happiness, our natural and nearest friends "—Then they say, that they speak, as they conceive, the real opinion of a great majority of the Euglish nation; and, finally, they conclude with the wonderful splendor of the French revolution, bursting forth upon the nations, in the full fervor of the meridian sun, and displaying in the midst of the European world, the prace tical result of principles, which philosophy had sought in the shade of speculation, and which experience must every where contimm. It dispels the clouds of prejudice from all people, reveals the secrets of all despotism, and creates a new character in man. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11864 Now cana more clear comment be read, upon the words of Paine and Barlow, than the words contained in the passage which have just read? Do they not clearly show you, that those societies are here stating s combination of principles with practice, in the same manner as Paine has done, the second par. of his works? That they are endeavouring io remove that prejucice from the people, which Mr. Paine conceires supported monarchy and aristocracy in ths country? It is said, by Paine and Barlos, that the first assembly, which ended in th year 1791, had been obliged, through te prejudices of the people, to form that constution in the manner in which they bad formed it, retaining a king, because the prejudices of the peopie would not at that time, permit them to form a government, without aking. It was too much, at that time, to form a government without a king; but the principles upon which they formed their g vernment, necessarily led to the destruction of that portion of monarchy which they had left
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11865 « Your example will be soon followed? for nations, rising from their lethargy, will te claim the Rights of Man, with a voice which man cannot resist."—The Righits of Man, in this passage, are the Rights of Man as they are stated in Paine’s works; for ths society has expressly declared Paine's worss to be the foundation of all their proceediogs They have considered themselves as proceeting to establish the Rights of Man, as tsuz! by Thomas Painc.—ou must recollect par sages to this effect, in several instances— And, therefore, when they say, “ will re-claim the Rights of Man, with voice which m2 cannot resist, they must be taken to maa the Rights of Man, in the full extent of we doctrine laid down in Paine’s book. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11866 Gentlemen, I may add to this a remark, by the way, that it is a little extraordinary, cou sidering how much the Constitutional Society has been involved in this case, and how im portant it would have been for the prisoner, at the bar, to have brought some members o! that society to have explained this transactioa, —all the transactions, indeed, of that societ’, and particularly this Address ; that not one member of the Constitutional Society 5 brought as a witness on this trial, except that poor dancing master, who is a member o both societies, and who seemed incapatleunderstanding any thing that passed. ith same thing occurs, to a great degree, ! respect to the London Corresponding SoatlyNotone witness whom they have brous, was a person capable, from the descnpvo he gave of himself, of accounting, 19 any manner whatever, for the Address of he London Corresponding Society. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11867 Gentlemen, you remember the manner in which these two Addresses were passed in these societies. The letter which was sent by Hardy, first, and the debate that passed between them, whether there should be a joint, or a separate address? This was not a thing taken up in a hurry, but a thing considered, and much debated upon; one in one form, and the other in another. If any evidence, upon this subject, could possibly have been given, which could have been advantageous to the prisoner at the bar, it, would certainly have been produced. In truth, both these addresses hold out, in pretty strong terms, a wish for an alliance and friendship with another country; that country certainly was not, at the time when these addresses were presented, in any adverse situation to this; but still, with respect to-this country, in such a situation as made it a matter deserving some degree of Caution, at least, or such as one should imagine would induce persons, thinking of presenting such addresses, to reflect a little upon it, befure they did it. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11868 How are these addresses received? One of the persons who were sent over with that of the Constitutional Society (how the London Sesfeponding Society's Address got over, we have not been able to show) was Mr. Joel Barlow, the gentleman who had written the “ Advice to the Privileged Orders,: in which he has completely stated what his ideas were, upon the subject of government, who: had reeently written an Address to the French Convention, with respect to the defects in their constitution of 1791, pointing -out a principal defect in that constitution to be the existence of a king and several other things, which, he conceived, ought to be removed, to render the government more complete, upon the principles of the Rights of Man. The other person was Mr. Frost, who, I shall likewise observe to you, is not called as a witness, on behalf of the prisoner. He was a person who had made himself a little obnoxious, and who afterwards became the object of a prosecution. When this address was presented to the National Assembly, in France, the president of the French Assemb! perfectly understood the matter. You will recollect, that there was likewise an address pronounced by the gentlemen who presented this address. Mr. Barlow and Mr. Frost were admitted to the bar, and thus addressed the Assembly : “ Citizens of France, We are deputed from the Society for Constitutional Information, in London, to present to you their congratulations on the triumphs of Liberty
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11869 This society had laboured long in the cause, with little pruspect of success, previous to the commencement of your revolution. What is this but a declaration, that this society had, before the French revolution, been employing itself exactly upon the same Principles as those upon which the French revolution was -effected? “Conceive, then, their exultation of gratitude, when, by the astonishing efforts of your nation, they behold the reign of reason acquiring an extension and solidity, which promise to reward the labours of all good men, by securing the happiness of their fellow creatures. Now, if this society had made this Address to the National Assembly, which finished when they had formed the constitution of 1791, it might have admitted, in some degree, of a different construction; but they never addressed that assembly, which formed the constitution of 1791. Why? Because the assembly, which formed the constitution of 1791, had not brought the revolution to the point of perfection. That was the reason they never addressed that assembly. On the contrary, till the revolution of the 10th of August took. place, they had no idea of entering into this sort of correspondence with the French. They then make these Addresses to the French Convention, at the same time declaring, that, before this revolution, the society had employed itself on the same important object.— ‘“ Innumerable societies, of a similar nature, are now forming in every part of England, Scotland, and Ireland; they excite a spirit of universal inquiry into the complicated abuses of government, and the simple means of reform. After the example which France has iven, the science of revolutions will be renered easy. Now, how was this revolution effected in France? By an assembly of the people ; lawfully assembled under the authority of the king, but taking upon themselves of their own authority, to declare themselves a convention of the people. These are the means by which this revolution was effected ; from that moment the fate king of France was deposed; from that moment the late revolution began ; and from that point it proceeded to its present situation. “ After the example given by France, the science of revolutions will be rendered easy, and the progress of reason will be rapid. It would not be strange, if, in a period far short of what we should venture to predict, addresses of felicitation should cross the seas to a National Convention in England. Now, what is the meaning of a National Convention in England ? Is this to be understood of a meeting of people, for the purpose of petitioning pare liament for a reform of parliament? What can it mean but a convention, assuming all the powers of government, precisely as the. National Convention of France, at that time, did? Is it possible to conceive, that any other construction can fairly be put upon those words? And have they brought one single man of this society, for the purpose uf showing, that such is not the construction which ought to be put upon these words? 
THOMAS_HARDY 11870 What is the answer of the president of the National Assembly? He has no sort of doubt of the intention and meaning of those persons; for he immediately calls them, “ Generous Republicans. He could not have a conception of -their principles, otherwise than as republican principles. When men addressed them in that style, they could not have an idea, that they were friends to the House of Commons, to the old peers, or to the new ones. The answerof the French presidentis : — Generous Republicans, your appearance in this place will form an epoch in the history of mankind. History will consecrate the day, when, from a nation, long regarded as a rival, and in the name ofa great number of your fellow citizens, you appeared in the midst of the representatives of the people of France. There is another passage, which, indeed, is a previous passage, which 1 particularly meant to have read: he shades of Pym, of Hampden, and of Sidney, are hovering over your heads, and the moment cannot be distant when the people of France will offer their conratulations to a National Convention in England. Why, gentlemen, the president of the French National Convention seems not to have the slightest doubt of the meaning of the address. He had nota conception, but that the persons who sentit, were disposed to establish, and desirous of establishing, in our country, a republican government ; and that they had actually taken the means for that purpose. He says, that the moment could not be fur distant when the people of France would offer their congratulations to a national convention in England. Is it possible to explain these transactions in any other sense than that which I have submitted to you? If it be, why has not some person or other appeared, as a witness, to have given what he conceives to be the true sense and meaning of the society, as you will recollect that a great deal of evidence has been introduced into this cause, for the purpose of giving constructions of the same sort? That makes it a very strong casc; for when persons are called to give constructions to words of one description, and there are none called to give a construction to words of another description, or to words used in one case, and not to words used in another, it must, at least, be taken, that, in that instance in which they do not attempt to give, by other means, a construction to words, the words are open to that construction which the words themselves fairly import. These words can import nothing else than a declaration of a complete design formed, of establishing, in this country, a republican government; of bringing about a national conventiun ; to which national convention, as an assembly, having in itself the executive and legislative powet of the government, the national assemly of France might send these congratulations. 
THOMAS_HARDY 11871 Gentlemen, it shows also, that the Convention, by their decrees of the 19th of November, and of the 15th of December, 1792, had adapted that sort of defence, which had been suggested to them,—“ the giving liberty to Europe,—as a mode of defence of their own narhe of the French nation, that they would afford military assistance to all people who wished to recover their liberty, within which description they most certainly had considered the British nation; because tne London Corresponding Society, and the Society for Constitutional Information, had expressly asserted that the British nation were slaves. The French had, by these decrees, declared that they would not permit a reformation in the House of Commons, if it was in their power to prevent it; they had, in effect, declared, they would compel the people of this country, at the request of the London Corresponding So ciety, and the Society for Constitutional Information, to accept a government, formed upon the principles of the sovereignty of the people; and that, if the people of this country should refuse to accept of Liberty and Equality, being desirous to preserve their prince, and their privileged casts, that they would treat them as enemies. 
EYRE 11872 Mr. Solicitor General, if you have finished this head on the Addresses to the National Conventivn of France, I think we had better adjourn ; as it will be impossible fur any human powers to sustain it, if we do not; and I think we should lose as much time to-morrow morning, as we should gain to-night. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11873 Gentlemen of the jury, When I had the honour of addressin: you last night, I stated to you the pa idea I had of the persons who were engaged in the transactions which have been brought in evidence before you, liow far in those transactions (though not specifically and precisely) how far I conceived the prisoner was generally implicated; what was his character in those transactions, and what were the characters of those who were the agents in them;protessing to consider, and to believe, that the vast majority of the persons engaged were not of that description of persons to whom the highly criminal intent imputed to the prisoner, ought to be imputed. I also stated to you what I conceived to be clearly the law upea the subject; hoping that, under the direction of my lords upon the bench, you will be of opinion that what I have stated as the law, is 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11874 Twesdex, liberty ; and that they had declared, in theSaeetaly the law of the land, derived down to us now for-a period of between four and five hundred years. Having proceeded then to state to you what appeared to be, from the evidence, as far as 1 went through it, the views, objects, and intentions of the persons concerned in these transactions, I had arrived at that period when the societies addressed the National Convention of France, aud I had insisted considerably at large upon that transaction. I had insisted upon it, because it appeared to me to be a transaction which showed their views, their intentions, and their objects so plainly, so clearly, and so irrefragably, that 1 thought it impossible, in any part of the case, more strongly to impress upon your minds what those views, what those intentions, and what those objects were, and how they meant finally to accomplish those views, intentions and objects, namely, by assembling a National Convention. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11875 I think, gentlemen, if you advert simply and only to those two Addresses; to that introduction to one of them when it was presented to the National Convention by Mr. Barlow and Mr. Frost, and to the answer which was given by the president of the National Convention—an answey in which no fraud or disguise was necessary to be used, and in which, on the contrary, the plain truth was most likely to appear—you can have no doubt in your own minds that the views, the objects, and the intentions of the prisoner at the bar, and of all those who were so far concerned with him as to have a complete conmexion with that transaction, were nothing less than the destruction of the government of this country, by means of an assembly of the people, and to establish a representative government in the room of that government under which this country has so long floufished, in spite of all the abuses that belong to it. Abuses will belong to every government, perhaps aboininable abuses belong to this government—I will not dissemble that there may be such; and as far asin my power, I should think it my duty to bring them forth whenever it should be necessary to do so, for whatever situation a man may stand in in the country, he bas an interest infinitely dearer than that situation. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11876 Gentlemen, having stated to you what apted to me to be a reasunable conclusion tom the transaction with France, which I have mentioned, I will notice to you the observations which naturally occur from the cunduct of those who were concerned in it: and I must here observe, that as it has been extremicly difficult in the course of this long drial, to mark with certainty all the papers that have been produced, I may by possibility, but I am sure it will be unintentionally, menUon to you some papers which may not have becn actually produced. If I should do so, I should be much obliged to the counsel for the prisoner if they can correct me. If not, Iwish my friends to do so. Twas going to state to you a letter from the society at Stockport to the prisoner, dated the Srd of November, 1792. gentlemen, ou will recollect that with respect to all the el that have been produced, except, I think, one, not a single observation has been made by the counsel for the prisoner. That one is a letter from Norwich, which I shall Notice to you presently. In this letter of the 3rd of November, 1792, the secretary of the society at Stockport, says, “ I am directed by the Friends of Universal Peace and the Rights of Man, which very title I think, if you advert to it, plainly shows what the intention and object of these parties were; for you will recollect (the thought occurs to me at the moment) that the idea which had been conceived by those persons, was an enthusiasm unquestionably, but an enthusiasm dangerous in the highest degree; the idea which they had conceived was, that by the establishment of the Rights of Man, universal peace would be established throughout the world. When, therefore, persons assuine the appellation of the Friends of Universal Peace and the Rights of Man, they plainly declare that they have Not in view any reform in the government of this country, as now established, because it is, according to their declaration, inconsistent not only ah their conception of the Rights of Man, but with their conception of the procuring universal peace. Their idea of the means of procuring universal peace was, that by establishing a representative government throughout the world, the interests of the people would be so immediately considered y the government of every country, that war would cease, and universal peace would be established throughout the universe, and all the world would be, in effect, one nation, You will recollect that that has appeared in a variety of instances in the papers which have been produced to you. Thatenthusiasm they certainly had, and an enthusiasin as dangerous to government as any that ever existed; as dangerous as the enthusiasm of the millenarians, or Fifth Monarchy-men, who in the last century occasioned some disturbance, not very violent, indeed, in this country, under an impression upon their minds that Christ was to come to establish his own government upon earth, and that there was to be universal peace and good-will among men ; what they called the kingdom of the saints. Under that impression they made an insurrection in the reign of Charles the second, which was suppressed after the death of a few people. There had been an insurrection of the same nature under the government of Cromwell, which also was soon suppressed; but the persons concerned in these transactions, to the very last persisted in their enthusiasm, and soine of those executed in the reign of Charles 2nd, protested in their last moments, that if they had been deceived, they had been deceived by heaven. When the minds of men are capable of being worked up to such blasphemous expressions, it is not possible to say to what length they may not go. Their sincerely entertaining such ideas, does not at all lessen the danger of them; does not at all lessen the necessity for the government of the country to take the means of repressing them, and punishing the delinquents in the severest manner. If men should take it into their heads that the community of goods is part of the christian religion, and should upon that ground take the goods of their neighbours, they must be punished as robbers, because it is impossible to preserve the peace of society by any other means. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11877 Gentlemen, I have digressed in consequence of what occurred to me from the title which! these people at Stackport chuse to assume. The letter proceeds—“ I am directed by the Friends of Universal Peace and the Rights of, Man, to inform you, that we received two! letters trom you; the first, dated September 21st, requesting us to concert with you in transmitting to the French National Convention an address signed by every member
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11878  It then proceeds to that which is not very material, except that it proves that this societyin London were not content simply with ad dressing the French Convention themselves, but attempted to prevail upon all the other societies to do the same thing, which they considered as assisting the cause to avery! preat degree; and, in aletter from the prisoner imself, in the course of the transaction—I forget to whom it was directed, but it is a letter in which he mentions the subscriptionto the French—thet, in his opinion, a number of signatures was infinitely better than any sum of'money they could think of subscribing. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11879 The letter proceeds— with respect tu the substance of this letter, we believe that the cause of the French is that of every individual person in Europe, that is not fattening on plunder, or who, through ignorance, obstinacy and inattention, sit unconcerned, and will not be persuaded to consider, although inevitable ruin should be the awful consequence
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11880  Here you see, gentlemen, that this society at Stockport declare most clearly what they considered to be the object of such an address to the French; that they considered the cause of the French as their own cause, and likewise that of every individual person in Europe, not fattening on plunder.—“ We therefore think it highly necessary to add our friendly aid and assistance, in order to stimulate the oppressed friends of freedom in France, against all the despots in Europe (who are combined against the just and equal rights of man), by assuring them that we view their signal excrtions, and wonderful victories, with admiration; together with,—mark this, gentlemen — together with the extinction of treacherous royalty, and the restoring to every individual, his equal, indubitable rights, as fellowthe impression that it was necessary 10 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11881 men and free citizens; and that our heart are united with theirs, as in one comma cause, considering, as in a great meas, their victory our emancipation, togetier with their own. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11882 Now, what was that victory 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11883 The glorious victory of the 10th of August. Gentlemen, has not this society at Stockport declared its views in the most complete and airect terms! —The extinction of treacherous rovulty is here not pointed out ambiguously; oo pointed out by words which will admit of a different construction, but by words direct and plain; by words which require no com ment, to which no answer could possibly be given, and to which, therefure, my lesmed friends did not attempt to give any answer. Gentlemen, their silence upon that sub ject is conviction —If they could have got nd of the force and effect of this letter, ty would have done so.—You cannot curcene that it was through any want of ability—tha it was through any want of industry; fer Tam sure, when you heard, more especialis, what fell trom my learned triend who spoke last, you must acknowledge, that (althouzh not possessing, perhaps, all the ornaments of eloquence which distinguish some men, and yet possessing them tu a very considerable degree) as a judicious, as a forcible, and as 3 really able and convincing advocate, he bss not his superior. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11884 Gentlemen, observe the manner in which this letter proceeds— “ Yes, should it ever be the case that our ministry should be so per dious, as contrary to their pee faith of neutrality, to join the execrable band of dee pots against the cause of freedom, we wil stand forward, even to the hazarding our lives, by using every justifiable means a counteract their machinations, and give to the friends of freedom all the encouragement and support which-we severally, unsupported, can afford, ; 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11885 Gentlemen, is not that a clear and plain de claration—is not that saying, without a doubt, that considering the cause oft the French as thelr own cause—considering the victories of the French as their own victories ; considering emancipation of the French as theirownemalcipation, theywere eager themselvesto to the extinction of what they call treacheroes royalty and so to restore toevery individual his equal and indubitable rights, as free meD free citizens; and thatthey would do this tothe hazarding of their lives: Tt seems 10, that it is impossible to conceive a more com plete comment upon those addresses to the National Convention, than that which is com tained in this letter
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11886 It seems impossible, when we advert to the contents of this ltter to have a doubt what were the obj the views and intentions of those ag 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11887 But, gentlemen, what is the letter Norwich, which my learned friends oie descend to observe upon—TI supposs be 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11888  . selection which in perbaps, they found, tp take notice of something, and without any very clear view, I should apprehend, in the have le of it; unless, that, in the course of the evidence, there was very considerable allusion to it, and therefore they thought it could not possibly escape notice
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11889 That letter is dated 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11890 November the 11th, 1792
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11891 The letter from Stockport was the 3d of November. This letter from Norwich, you will recollect, was made the subject even of debate in the meetings of the societies. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11892 It states, “ We, the Society for Political Information at Norwich, are desirous of holding, and strenuously supporting, the noble sentiments, which you (the London Corresponding Society) “ so lately and friendly dispersed among us; and, as we so much admire your well-adapted plan for a reformation in the state, permit us, with the utmost deference to your worthy society, to participate with you in all your great national correspondence, which your very name promises to maintain ; and in consequence thereof, it is humbly desired by the society which I have the happiness to represent, to incorporate three members with yeur worthy fraternity; in doing which, I shall here inform you of their names and residence : then the three persons are mentioned—“ Our principal design in doing this, is, that we may have an opportunity of knowing more exactly, what may be thought the most eligible steps to be taken in carrying on this great business of our associated brethren, and to have an opportunity to ask such sort of questions as may be thought very reasonable among the brethren, especially when we think that publications are covered with a sort of obscurity in them, as the Sheffield people’s declaration, which seems determined to support the duke of Richmond’s plan only, 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11893 Now there, gentlemen, is a society which Perceives a sort of obscurity in the declarations uf the Sheffield society, and states in what it conceives that obscurity to consist, “ especially when we think that publications are covered with a sort of obscurity in them, as the Sheffield pevple’s declaration, which seems determined to support the duke of Richmond’s plan only. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11894 Gentlemen, you will recollect that the plan of the duke of Richmond was a plan: which, however I may think it wild and extravagant, wasa pan which had no other object whatever than that of reforming the House of Commons in this country, by making all persons who were of a certain age, and not liable to certain objections, capable of giving their Votes for the election of members of that House, dividing the whole country into districts for that purpose, and allotting, I think, about 2,600 votes to the election of every member, and making the members about 500. So that it had not, in any degree whatever, in view, the giving what is called the right of active citizenship? that is the right of every man to share in the government of the country; but expressly confining in his letters, and in all his declarations upon the subject, his idea of reform, to giving to every man the right of choosing a person by whom the laws by which he was to be governed, were to be made —a distinction very clear-and very plain, but not very easily to be found in that declaration of the Sheffield people
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11895 The Norwich Society, therefore, thought that there was a sort of o! scurity in the declaration of the Sheffield people; in consequence of which, they began to apprehend that this Sheffield society did not mean to go the length which they intended. They say, that, from this declaration of the Sheffield people, they begin to apprehend that the Sheftield people seemed determined to support the duke of Richmond’s plan only.— The letter adds—“ But, since we find, in a printed letter received from them in a book, that they mean to abide by some moderate reform, as may hereafter be brought forward by the Friends of the People’—You will recollect, in the interval, the Society of the Friends of the People was established, which professed to have in view only a moderate reform; and which, likewise, if you may judge from the evidence that has been I ee atthe bar by some of the members of that society, never conceived even the duke of Richmond’s plan to come within the descri tion of a moderate reform, but always thought that plan wild and extravagant. The letter adds—“ which method is uncertain to us.— Here you find that the Friends of the People, and Society for Constitutional Information, do not exactly e; and you will re collect that the Friends of the People, and the Society for Constitutional Information, se very little agreed, that the Friends of the People had declared that they would have nothin; more to do with the Society for Constitution Information, because they saw clearly, that, in the transactions in which the Society for Constitutional Information were engagin; they had not in view a reform of the Come mons House of Parliament, but had in view, as the letter of the Friends of the People states, the accomplishment of what is termed “all Mr. Paine’s plans for public benefit ; including therefore, necessarily, the extinction of treacherous royalty, the extinction of aristocracy, and the establishment of perfect representation. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11896 The letter proceeds, after observing that the Friends of the people and the Society for Constitutional Information did not agrce— “ We would be glad to know the reason; it seems to me as though the difference was this: the Friends of the People mean only 4 partial reform, because they leave out words expressing the duke of Richmond's plan, and talk only of a reform; while the Manchester people s¢em to intimate, by addressing Mr. Paine, as though they were intent upon republican principles only. We are accused of pressing hard upon the prisoner for addressing Paine. Did not this Norwich Society, with whom he corresponded, consider that, by addressing Paine, the Manchester people seemed to intimate that they were intent upon republican principles only ? And did not the Friends of the People put the same construction upon the conduct of the Society for Constitutional Information. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11897 The letter proceeds —“ Now, to come closer to the main question, it is only desired to know whether the generality of the societies mean to rest satisfied with the duke’s plan only’—conceiving therefore, as you see. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11898 Gentlemen, that the least that they were to vein view, was establishing the duke’s plan —‘ Whether the generality of the societies mean to rest satisfied with the duke’s plan only ; that is, whether you struggle for more, or will be contented with that; for that must be the meaning of the words— or whether it is their private design to rip up monarchy by the roots, and plant democracy in its stead. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11899 Gentlemen, when we attend to this letter, ais impossible not to perceive that this Norwich Society was floating in a degree of uncertainty with respect to the views of the other societies, was disposed, perhaps, to be content with the duke of Richmond’s plan only, to rest satisfied with it, but at the same time to obtain whatever it could beyond it. That this letter was written for the purpose for which it was supposed by the London Corresponding Society to have been written, for the purpose of knowing what were the true and real sentiments of this London Corresponding Society. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11900 Now, gentlemen, if the London Corresponding Society had intended to hold sacred the House of Lords, and had no object in view but establishing a new constitution of the monarchy of the country, to hold sacred the House of Commons, by universal suffrage and annual parliaments, would they have hesitated in answering this letter? would they, as described in Lynam’s evidence (and by the way I would observe that Lynam’s evidence throughout is capable of being contradicted by hundreds and Gapdreds of persons, if it be Not true, and there is not one person brought to contradict one single word of it), would they have deliberated in the manner in which he describes them to have deliberated upon the subject? would they have thought that this letter was intended: to draw them into some incautious declaration, and that in conequerce they might be brought into some difficulties? what incautious declaration could they have been drawn into by this letter, if they had meant what it is now pretended they did mean? Their answer in that case would have been, “ You have totally mistaken us; we have not the most distant idea of what you suppose, of ripping up monarchy by the roots, and placing democracy in its Stead; our view is simply and only a reform of the House of Commons upon the duke of 's plan. The answer to the letter was the most simple and plain imaginable, it never could have been matter for deliberatia and consideration. They would have treated this letter as a letter not to draw them i, except it was to draw them in to do thz which they did not mean to do, and asa letter which ought, therefore, to be rejected with the utmost indignation. But what do they do? they deliberate upon this letter, whichis dated the 11th of November, and at on the 26th of November, they send this aswer—it was addressed, first of all, “ Gentle men, but that is scratched out, and “ Fell Citizens put in its place. Observations have been made upon the word citizen. U! tionably we are all citizens of the same sta, and when the word citizen is used without any particular allusion, it certainly means notbmg in any degree improper; but what is the comment which they themselves have gives upon the word citizen, in the report of ther committee of constitution? They distinguish between citizen and subject—“ citizen, the ancient appellation given to the members of free states—subject can only, with propriety, be applied to a member of a state whose go vernment has been instituted by foreign con uest, or by the prevalence of a domestic action. Thus they have constantly, if you will recollect, in all their papers, intimated the most gross falshood—that the British constitution was a government instituted by foreign conquest; meaning, as Mr. Paine thinks proper to assert most falsely, that the constitution and government of this country was the result of the Norman conquest, whereas, in truth, all the alteration that that comagiteak introduced, was an alteration pra cipally in the aristocratical part of the constitution, and those must recollect who know any thing of the history of the country, that the Saxon es and institutions are the whole foundation of our government, particularly that part of it which vonsiats in the admins tration of justice, which is the great security of the liberty of the subjectThercfore, gentlemen, the word “ citizen is not an ndifferent word when used by these persoss: it would be indifferent used by others, but when used by persons who draw a distinction between citizen and subject, and who assert that no persons are to be called subjects bet those who are members of a state whose co vernment has been instituted by foreign conquest, or the prevalence of a domestic factica, which they call an usurped government, they mean to assert that they are determined no longer to remain subjects of the British co vernment, but to be fellow citizens of a new state. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11901 Gentlemen, the letter having in its adcres the alteration from “ gentlemen to “ Fellow Citizens, proceeds thus—“ Your letter of the 11th instant, was by the secretary laid behre the Committee of Delegates of the London 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11902 Corresponding Society; the London Corres-}| They proceed, gentlemen, to say, “ they ponding Society having never before heard of your society, wish to have some further information concerning it, as to its origin, its principles, and the number of its members. h an account in your next letter will give them great satisfaction. Here, gentlemen, they are writing to a society of whom they profess not before to have heard; of whom, therefore, they ought certainly to have been particularly cautious, because they could not possibly know any thing of that which they here inquire after, the principles of its embers. The letter proceeds—“ They do not tho‘ roughly comprehend how it would be possible to incorporate with our society, three of your members residing in Norwich, inasmuch as it would be impossible to communicate to them at that distance all our correspondence, ‘and they could not attend our committees, where the business is transacted. If it is information you want, they will very readily -alswer- any question you may put to them. As to the object they have in view, they refer you to their addresses. I shall take notice -of these addresses presently, of which my learned friend reminds me that the counsel for the prisoner have taken no notice whatever; not one single observation has been made upon those ardresses, though those adare here expressly referred to, as containing the objects the society had in view. “ As to the objects they have in view, theyTefer you to their addresses; you will therein " see they mean to disseminate political knowledge, and thereby engage the judicious part of the nation to demand a restoration of their “rights in annual parliaments. The members ot those parliaments, owing their election to the unbought and nnhiiassed suffrage of every citizen in possession of his reason, and not incapacitated by crimes, they consider the obtaining such parliaments to be the indwork of every necessary reform. To this, therefore, they steadily adhere, and turn themselves neither to the right, nor to the left, to follow any other plan whatever. The rules and orders of their society being so plain and easy, that if they can get a majority of the nation to act as they do, the proposed reform will effect itself. They look upon the trifling differences that may have arisen between the several societies to be of very little consequence, and think they will subside without any ways injuring the cause. Those trifling differences consisted, as stated to them by the Norwich Society, in the question, whether the societies meant to rest sa-tisfied with the duke of Richmond's plan only; or, as the Friends of the People proposed, still less violent measures ; or whether it was their private design to rip up monarchy by the roots, and place democracy in its stead. These are the phe! differences ; and I observe that this word riffing is put in the place of the word little. It, therefore, Was hot a word that was not considered. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11903 think it a matter of small importance what. ever name you choose to adopt; they advise you to follow their plan, and divide yourselves Into small societies, each of which to choose a delegate; the delegates when met to form the committee, and transact the business of the society ; afterwards let each delegate sapere to his division the business so done, let him admit fresh members, communicate fresh intelligence, promote and encourage political discussion, or read to you such books as may convey the instruction your weaker members stand in need of. Weak brethren, you will recollect is a term that was very much in use at one time; it meant a person that was not risen to that height of enthusiasm which was necessary for what was then called the good cause— but above all, and then the word “ gentlemen, is struck out—“ but above all be careful to preserve peace and good order among you; let nu dispute be carried to excess. And here come the words which show the meaning of the whole of this letter—The question put to them was, whether it was their private design to rip up monarchy by the roots, and place democracy in its stead; see what answer they give to that. Instead of expressing their indignation at such an idea: instead of saying, how could you imagine that such was our intention: how could you conceive that we had ever thought of destroying that which is so essential to the established constitution of this country, which is indeed the very essence of its government ; the essence of the government of this country being that it is a monarchy; a limited monarchy; the great use of that monarchy being that it reduces action to a single point, it suppresses ambition, it contains every thing within a just prerogative, and it gives us this boast, that we never need fear a Robespierre, or any dictator, because we have a king; because we have a person at the head of all, to whose situation no person can aspire, but whose powers are so limited by known and bounded prerogatives, that he cannot pass beyond them without exciting the jealousy of all? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11904 “Gentlemen, the answer is very curious ; it is—“ Let no dispute be carried to excess; leave monarchy, democracy, and even religion entirely aside; never dispute on these topics. What! never dispute on the topics of monarchy and democracy! on the propriety of establishing the one or the other as the government of a country, when persons were considering what ought to be the reform to be created in the governmont of the country ! “ Let your endeavours go to increase the number of those who wish fora full and equal representation of the people, and Icave toa parliament so chosen to form plans for remedying the existing abuses. Should they then not answer your expectations, at the year's end, you may choose others in their stead. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11905 Now, gentlemen, this letter which chooses to leave monarchy and democracy entirely alone, in effect states a plan of clear and pure democracy ; for it says— let your endeavours go to increase the number of those who wish for a full and equal representation of the people, and leave toa parliament so chosen —that is an entire parliament, so chosen by a full and equal representation of the people— an elective senate —for it can mean nothing else— to form plans for remedying the existing abuses. Should they then not answer your expectations, at the year’s end you may choose others in their stead
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11906 This is not too strong a comment which I have made upon the words, “ those who wish for a full and equal representation of the people, and “leave toa parliament so chosen; because if you will look at the address of the London Corresponding Society, of the 6th of August 1792, they speak in clear, plain, and unequivocal language of a parliament so chosen, as that which is to accomplish all their purposes. When they referred therefore in this letter to their addresses—when in this letter they inserted this passage, the same idea pressed upon their minds—namely, that by a full and equal representation of the people, they meant a parliament chosen as they there state, they meant a parliament wholly elective, excluding & House of Lords, and you will observe, that in this address of the 6th of August 1792, they describe it accordingly as the people’s parliament. After taking notice of some things which I shail have occasion to observe upon presently, they say ‘“ numerous other teforms will undoubtedly take place even in the first session of a parliament so elected— that is of the whole parliament so elected— “depending only upon their electors, undivided by faction, uncorrupted by the minister, and uninfluenced but by the public good. Gentlemen, if their views went simply to the representation of the people, in the Commons House of Parliament, in what sense could they possibly have used these words? One paper retlects upon the other; it is clear and plain, that that only, which I have stated, could have been their intent. The letter proceeds, o preserve peace and good order among you, let no dispute be carried to excess. Leave monarchy, democracy, and even religion entirely aside. Never dispute on these tupics. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11907 Gentlemen, you have been told that the prisoner never talked of the abolition of meonarchy—never talked of the abolition of the peerage—of the establishment of democracy—but all his language was only of the duke of Richmond’s plan
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11908 Grant that it was 80; what does it prove, but that he observed the lesson which he taught to others, and which perhaps this ver Tetter might teach him the necessity of observing—“ to leave monarchy, democracy, and even religion entirely aside, never to dispute on these topics, but to let his endeavours go only toencreasing 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11909 (te the number of those who wished for a fil and equal representation of the people, cording to sense in which he used the words; and “ leaving to a parliament so cwniente accomplish every object that wis! a The letter proceeds—“ The committee oa you every assistance in their power, bi request that your questions may relate chid: to the methods of obtaining a reform in pe liament. Still observing the same sortconduct; do not put to us any such awkwar questions, as whether we mean to be coskat with the duke of Richmond’s plan only, whether it is our private design to npmonarchy by the roots, and place demon in its stead—those are awkward questicts; we don’t like to write answers to such que tions, but request your guesses may reise chiefly to the methods of obtaining a reforw in parliament. The letter concludes, “ Lic yourselves we are friends to peace, notauarcr, and well wishers to the Rights of Man, s¢ not so sanguine in our expectations, 3s imagine those rights will be restored by ue spontaneous consent of those who have 2 long deprived mankind of them. Gentlemen, you will observe that the lett: from the Norwich Society, to which this letter is an answer, concludes—“ I shall say more at present, but remain a friend to peac, not to anarchy, a well wisher to the Rights o Man, when obtained by consent. The a swer to it says, “ The London Corresponding Society, are also friends to peace, not anarchy, and well wishers to the RightsMan, yet not so sanguine in their expect tions, as to imagine those rights will b restored by the spontaneous consent of thove who have so long deprived mankind of then. Thus they expressly declare that their ness are not of the peaceable description of thee of the Norwich Boclety that they look tos degree, at least, of force; to taking the & vernment of the country, from those to whem it has been intrusted, against their const; and to ne it b ae mpauses epee selves shall provide for the purpose. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11910 Gentlemen, this, and numberless other letters of the same description, which I might observe upon, clearly and distinctly, as it seems to me, show the principles, the views, and the intentions of the persons who are engaged in this transaction ; and the means by which they meant finally to accomplish those intentions. I think that we may fairly judge of the views and intentions, and even of the principles of a man, not only by what he himself declares, but by the principles of the company he keeps; by the principles of those whose character, and whose acts he approves, by the principles of his publications, I am told I am not to judge of men by their opinions but by their actions, I answer, I must frequently judge of the object of their actions by their opinions. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11911 Suppose the Roman Catholics, in the reign of king Willlam, had set about a reform of religion, and for that purpose had attempted to assemble a convention, to act as a convention of the people, for the reform of religion. Could you have had a doubt what sort of a reform they meant to effect? Could you have had a doubt that they meant to establish Popery ? Would a doubt of it have existed in the mind of any man? And one great reason why you could not have had a doubt of it, would be, the intolerant principles of Popery, though perhaps not of the Roman Catholic religion, for I know they make a great distinction, and a distinction in some degree well founded, between Papists and Roman Catholics; but the great majority of Roman Catholics in England, at least in former times, were Papists, if they are not so now. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11912 Gentlemen, when we advert to the papers which have been laid before you, we must observe the same spirit of intolerance in these societies. The French at this moment are as intolerant in their political principles as the Papists ever were in their religious principles. They willnot endure any other sort of government to exist in the world, but their ownform of government, because they say that the government which the light of reason discovers to man, ought to prevail all over the world, and therefore they are in conscience bound to promote it. Thus they hold the same obligation upon conscience in matters of politics, as the Papists deemed bindin, upon conscience in matters of religion, an which men hold to be binding in matters of religion, because they think they ought toendeavour to prevail upon other men to take those means for their final happiness, which they themselves think the right means. This is a natural impression upon the mind of man; but applying that Feinciple to government is perfectly new, and dangerous to the highest degree; as it tends to the unsettling of eve state whatever, because no two persons “il agree upon the question, which. is the must proper form of government? No two persons perhaps ever perfectly agreed upon the subJect—and if persons by doen certain principles, and act upon the persuasion, that those Principles are so clearly the result of the light of reason, that they ought to be established throughout the world, and that it is highly meritorious to establish them throughout the world, they act upon a principle of intolerance which is just as great, and just as dangerous as that of the Papists. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11913 If therefore men, who in the years 1793, and 1794, professed to consider no government as lawful, but that which is established on what they call the indefeasible Rights of Man, as taught by the French, by Paine, and by Barlow; and who professed to admire every thing done in France—the extermination of treacherous royalty, aud all hereditary distinction, and the confiscation of property ; if such men show a desire to fraternize with persons of the same disposition; if such men proceed to declare their intention to reform the government of Great Britain, and take steps for that purpose; and especially if the steps they take are, endeavouring to assemble a convention, which should act in the character of a convention of the people, can any thing but the destruction of the British government be their end? Is it possible to imagine, that they had any other object? For if they should once have it in their power to effect any reform, can they, upon their own principles stop short of that reform, which they declare can alone constitute a lawful government? It is not in the nature of things gentlemer. If men once get the power to make a reform, and lay it down as a principle that the only just rule in forming a government, is establishing the indefeasible and imprescriptible Rights of Man, with all their consequences, the necessary result is, that the moment they have the power in their hands, they will do the whole. It is impossible to doubt it. But it is not simply opinions, which the Sean and those who were combined with im have declared. They are not simply opinions ; they are resolutions—resolutions to act upon opinions. The societies, by their addresses to the French Convention, have declared, not only their opinion that the government of this country ought to be republican —not only their wish to make the government of this country republican—but a resolution to take measures to effect it. They resolve to make the government of this country republican—and? having so done, they in effect declare, that they have entered into a complete conspiracy against the government of the country. For when men entertain opinions ; when these opinions are followed by a wish to carry them into effect, and a resolution to attempt to accomplish that wish, they form a conspiracy to do what they sowish to bedone, Ido not know what is a conspiracy, if that is not one. And these men have declared, not only that such are their opinions, that such is their wish, that such is their resolution, but they have declared how they mean to accomplish that resolution ; namely, by means of a convention of the people; and to establish within this country, that sort of government which would enable the French National Convention to address a National Convention in England, not as a constituent assembly, simply, but as the governing power of this country. Gentlemen, this has been the construction which has been put upon acts combined with opinions in other cases, What was the case of Crohagan, which was mentioned by one of my learned friends? A man declared his opinion that the king ought to be killed; he declared his wish to effect it; he declared his resolution to effect it, if he could come at the king. This he declared in Spain; and having done so, he came to England. What was the interpretation which a jury put upon all this ? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11914 That he came to England for the purpose of effecting that resolution which he had previously made; namely, a resolution to kill the king if he could come at him; andInever heard the propriety of that decision of the jury, in any degree reprobated; on the con , it is always stated as an illustration of aprinciple. But if he had declared, not only, that he had formed the resolution to kill the king, but that he inittended to do it bya ah ge instrument, aud if he afterwards ad provided that very instrument, how strongly would the providing that instrument have declared his purpose, and especially if the instrument was of a particular construction, and such as is not ordinarily used ? You would say, immediately, there could not be a possibility of doubt of his purpose. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11915 Now let us see how this Corresponding Society, and those who leagued with theinn—I mean always the leading members—proceeded to carry into execution, that purpose which it seems to me they had clearly and expressly demonstrated in these addresses to the National Convention of France, and in the addresses of the London Corresponding Society, to the people of England, which I shall presently mention, and in the letters which I have observed upon. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11916 Gentlemen, this is necessarily a deduction of some length—but why is it so? because in the nature of the thing, a resolution of this kind could not be carried into effect in a moment. The only means by which it could be effected was, by raising up a strong party in this country to assist the conspirators in 0; ia the completion of their intent. The Revolution which has taken place in France, peat from very small beginnings, to the eight at which it has arrived. If we trace it from its source, we shall find so much similarity between what has happened there, and the nature of the attempt made in this country, so far as they have gone, that I think we shall perceive that the difference in the events has arisen from difference in circumstances, The ancient government of France had become so odious to all ranks of the people, that the opinion of the people, by which alone a government can be supported, failing all at once, the whole fabric fell together, almost without a struggle; and it was obvious to every one, that the meeting of the states-general, in the year 1789, must produce a total change ia the government of the country for this plain reason, that the opinions of a vast majority of the people were changed, with Tespect to the Propriety of their existing government; and whenever that shall be the case in any country, the government of that country cannot stand. The government of Great Britain, on the contrary, has long been the object of affection. We are in the habit of considering, that it has produced, during a long course of years, great public good. e view it with all its faults, with all its imperfections ; but in the result, wishing, as all of ere ee us may honestly and probably do wish, togive it as much of perfection as we can; and though we are sorry to see many of the abuses which prevail in it, yet we view it with a great degreeof attachment, and of reverence. e may be told, perhaps, gentlemen, and so we have been told by writers upon this subject, that all this is prejudice—prejudice! Gentlemen! What are the opinions that we form, upon the greatest number of subjects, but such as may be deemed prejudices? Is the mind of any man capable of reflecting, in all its extent, upon every thing which comes before its view. We are obliged, necessarily, to take a great deal from the instruction of others ; and that alone makes the important difference between men of education, aud men of no education. For education is, ina great degree, the instilling what, in this powt of view, may be considered as prejudices into the minds of men. It is giving them the benefit of the opinions of others; teaching them, in early life, to rest satisfied with the deductions which have brought the minds of other men to certain points; to take them as data, as principles, upon which they will p ceed to reason, and to act, in their future Men of great leisure, who have the opportanity of contemplating subjects with more mnuteness, who are not engaged in busines which any way distracts their attention, may speculate upon various subjects, which generality of men, in the busy world, cannot possibly find leisure to contemplate, whateret their situation in life may be. And a grest majority of the people in every country, let the nature of its government be what it msy, must necessarily be so much employed in ob taining the ordinary comforts of life, that it is impossible for them to employ’ upon many subjects, with any very good ef fect. This sort of fous it is that mio ences the minds of the generality of the people, with respect to the government of country
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11917 It possesses their a opinion — Why? Because they have been taughtthink it ought to possess their good opinies; because it has been handed down to then by their forefathers; that it has, fora grat course of years, produced a greater portion of happiness to the people of the country, has been generally enjoyed under the gover ment of other countries.—Why it has so, very few men have the leisure, very few men have the ability, to inquire. Perhaps no man is capable’ of viewing it, in all its et tent, and all its consequences ; seeing all the minute parts of it, how they depend 00 upon the other, and how the moving or tering of any particular part may effect, in ils consequences, the whole. But we know that the result of the whole, combined, in po and practice, is, to a certain extent, good, Sreretorg we are arches to at har Lal tlemen, is unquestio: a of dice; but it is that sort of Pace Re by me every government is supported, and by alone a t can be supported—the 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11918 ; prejudice of public opinion—and the first atarr) 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11919 (Parry tempt to destroy a government must necessarily be, to destroy that prejudice of public opinion in its favour, which is its support. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11920 he first operation of those who conspired the destruction of the ancient government of France, was unquestionably to destroy it in ; the public opinion; and that was completely effected befure the meeting of the states-general, in 1789. Having done this, they had removed every thing which ma retseil the go-Vernment, and it necessarily fell. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11921 Gentlemen, those who have imitated the proceedings of the French, in this country, ; and imitators, I call them, not because they make use of such a word as convention, " jmitators, I call them, not because they talk of organizing, and appoint committees, for Various purposes, suc as are made use of in 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11922 “ the French Assembly, but because they haveproceeded directly upon the plan which has succeeded in France, in overturning the established government; . they have proceeded upon the plan, which not only destroyed the government which existed previous to the year 1789, but which has also destroyed that 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11923 “ constitution established in 1791, which wasthe Most popular constitution, in its form, that ever was established in any country, with a king at the head, and indeed more popular than any constitution that ever was establishedin any country whatever. For the king of the French, as he was called, under that constitation, had, in effect, very little authority, except that most extravagant revenues unquestionably were assigned him, and some particular prerogatives were given him, which probably were intended, by those who framed the constitution, to enable him to assume, again, a certain degree of power, which they might conceive to necessary for keeping the whole together, and preventing the mass from tumbling to pieces. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11924 Gentlemen, Mr. Paine was fully aware of the effect of all this. He tells you, in his ig affection for this country, that, during e American war, he had it in contemplation, having transferred all his love for his native country to America, and declared himself acitizen of the world; an expression which tends to destroy all those attachments which unite ustogether; a man who becomes what he calls a citizen of the world, becomes, in a certain degree, an enemy to his own country, acting contrary to all those natural attachments which unite us to the society in which we have been educated, and which have hitherto been conceived as the best affections of man, and which the principles of these men lead directly to destroy
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11925 Mr. Paine says, he had conceived the idea of coming into this country, during the American war, keeping uiet till he could publish a book, which he ght would have had the effect of overturning the government of this country. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11926 This he mentions in a note, which shows what was, in his mind, the consequence of ttacking the public opinion upon the government of a country. He opens the introduction to the Second Part of the Rights of Man, with observing, that, what Archimedes said of the mechanical powers may be applied to reason and liberty : “ Had we a place to stand upon, we might raise the world. He conceived, that the propagation of his principles was that standing P ¢, by means of which he hoped to raise the world. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11927 Gentlemen, you will observe, that an imPression was made on the minds of all these men, that what had passed in France, in the course of the years 1789, 1790, and 1791, was 8 prelude only to that which afterwards would follow, long before the 10th of August, 1792 ; and that the 10th of August, 1792, was the glorious victory which completed their triumph. They considered the world as in a course: of revolutions; and, in the phrase of Mr. Paine, that revolutions were the order of the day. The impression upon the minds of these men, that the world was in a course of revolutions, and that revolutions were the order of the day, appears throughout almost all their papers. You will find, upon examination, that they considered a revolution as inevitable ; as that to which the nation must finally come. They have been likewise taught that the danger to which alone this sort of revolutionary principle was liable (for so Paine teaches them), was, the revolution being attempted, before the principles upon which revolutions ought to eee, and the advantages to result from them, were sufficiently seen and understood. Therefore, the object of the works of Mr. Paine, Mr. Barlow, and other publications of that description, was, to show to the people of this country, the principles upon which revolutions ought to proceed, and the advantages to result from them, in order that these being sufficiently seen and understood, the rest might follow. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11928 Gentlemen, for this purpuse a variety of pamphlets have been published, which have been observed upon to you. These pamphlets have clearly and unquestionably for their object, to destroy the opinion which the people generally have of the excellence of the British constitution, in all its parts, but more especially in those two parts which the counsel for the prisoner have said, it was the object of the prisoner to retain. For these books consider a House of Commons as a thing tolerable only in comparison with a House of Lords; anda monarchy they consider as utterly destructive of all principle. That there is something like principle ina House of Commons, but nothing like it in the other two. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11929 Gentlemen, if the persons who were engaged inthis did not mean to destroy this government, why should they endeavour to destroy the public opinion with respect to it? If they meant to reform it, why should they declare that no constitution existed? How could they reform that ‘which did not exist? The very declaration that there was no lawful constitution existing in the country, was a declaration, that whatever they might like in the present constitution, they meant to adopt as part of a new establishment, and not as part of the old establishment. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11930 Gentlemen, the ease with which men are induced to imagine that things are wrong in the state, has often been observed upon ; it has been said by an aneient and venerable writer of our own country, that “He that goeth about to persuade a multitude they are Not so well governed as they ought to be, shall never want attentive and favourable hearers ; fos they know the manifold defects to which every kind of regimen is subject ; but the secret lets and difficulties, which, in all public proceedings, are innumerable and inevitable, they have not ordinarily the judgment toconsider
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11931 In this view, all these pamphlets were written ; holding out, in the most glaring colours, every thing that was an abuse ; never once telling the people that they ought to consider what were the secret lets and diffieulties, which, ig all public proceedings, are innumerable and inevitable, and which, thereought to make all persons extremely cautious with respect even to the abuses of government, because, without very minutely attending to it, they may not be aware of those secret lets and difficulties which occasioned those very abuses, and which, perhaps, are absolutely inevitable, from the nature of things; from the constitutions of men; their habits, prejudices, passions, and a variety of other circumstances; all of which must be considered, when people consider, not only the constitution of the government, but the administration of that government. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11932 But, for the purpose of a systematic attack upon the government of the country, it was necessary that there should be some leader, some head, to direct the whole. Gentlemen, what has been the wonderful effect of the societies which have been established in France; I mean the Jacobin club, with its forty-four thousand affiliated popular societies, which, fora great length of time, really governed France, and kept it in continual agitation 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11933 The persons who were employed in this country, seem to me to have conceived the idea of proceeding expressly upon the same principle. —You will recollect a letter, which I cannot immediately refer to, which says that the several societies ought to unite together, that they might act in unison ; observing that itwas by this means, that in France they finally obtained their eud.—You will recollect the letter to which I refer.—In the most expressterms, it declares, that these clubs were formed upon the very principle of the Jacobin club, and all those affiliated societies, and with the same view and intent, to make the whole mass co-operate as one entire body, in order ae to accomplish the object of their wishes. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11934 the person whose name aj 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11935 One society, principally made use of for these purposes, was the Society for Constitutional Information, with respect to which, this observation may be made: It was a soci originally consisting of gentlemen of respectable characters, and in lependent principles —Some of them, perhaps, were soured by dis content ; and might carry their discontent ts great lengths; but they were men who wer not likely to answer the puposes of the per. sons who are the objects of the charge pow before you. Thete were likewise who got into this club, from time to time, and began to use such language, and to condect themselves in such a manner, that, yeu will find, almost all the original members of the club deserted it; and at last, as you will recollect from the proceedings of the society which were read to you, about sixteen or se venteen persons, appear to have been the whole of the members who regularly attended, frequently only five, six, or seven were present; and the business was often transacted with a great degree of inattention, There were seldom more than sixteen or seventeen present ; and if we advert to the persons present upon the important transactions, we shall find that a very few indeed, guided and directed that club
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11936 One constant attendant was Mr. Horne Tooke. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11937 You will easily perceive that such a society as this, was not that sort of society which could be made to operate as a Jacobin club; because a society of this description was net an open society, it could not, from the natere of its constitution, be made a popular society. But people looked to the character which the Society for Constitutional Information had long had in the country ; for the world in general did not know that their old res members bad declined attending the society. —WMr. Sheridan said, I think, that he had not attended at the society for eight or ten years. —As that, however, wasa thing not genetally known to the world, the proceedings of the Constitutional Society, signed by tbe se. cretary, had with the world the ty of the names of all those persons whe had been members of the society
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11938 It was necessary to keep up the character and reputatice of this society, but at the same time to form another society, which should act in confor. mity to the plan which had been laid ; and with this view, it appears, that the London Corresponding Society was established by the prisoner, in conjunction with some other persons, he taking upon himself the character of secretary. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11939 The consequence of this has been, that the prisoner at the bar has stood as the clear leader in all these transactions. By header, aay pears com forward in all the Gannichons, and he is involved therefore in all. He became afterwards, by association, a member of the Society for Constitutional Information. oo Gentlemen, the plan and constitusiom of this London Corresponding Society was admirably calculated for the effect which it was intended to have. Its name imports that the object of it was, to correspond with all other societies of the like description; and an imnportant object of this society was, to unite, by means of that correspondence, all the country societies with this society in London, and with the Society for Constitutional Intormation; so that they might move in one bond of union, in the manner recommended by that letter which I have mentioned to you. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11940 This society was extremely popular in its constitution. Any body might be admitted a member of it, of any description. The sums collected from the members were very small, They were formed into divisions; and when the members amounted to a certain number, they were to be divided again, for the purpose of diffusing their meetings more generally over the whole town
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11941 They were to have from each division a delegate; the delegates formed a committee of delegates; and that committee of delegates was to be guided by the committee of correspondence; for, as their business was principally correspondence the Commitee of Correspondence necessarily had the management of almost every thing; 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11942 and that committee of correspondence finally became the Conmittce of Secrecy, which I before observed upon. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11943 This society have, in three publications which they have given to the world, and which the gentlemen on the other side have notin any degree observed upon, declared their principles and vbjects, so far as they Ahought it proper and sate to declare them. You will recollect the manner in which they expressed themselves in the answer to the Norwich letter; and I must beg you will always have in view the answer to that Norwich letter. It is akey to all their language. It directs the Norwich Societies to leave monarchy and democracy, and all disputes upon that subject alone; but to look forward to one distinct object—the obtaining a fulland equal representation of the people in parliament, leaving to a parliament s0 chosen, to carry into execution the rest of their views, ifthey should not be able immediately to carry them into execution. Their intention, therefore, was, to keep as much as possible out of their publications, any thing about monarchy or democracy ; but, at the same time, tu express themselves in such a manuer as should convey completely, to those who chose to understand them, all that they meant. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11944 The first address of the London Corresponding Society was dated the 2nd of April, 1792, but which the evidence has clearly shown you, was concerted between the prisoner and some other persons, ata much earlier period. It begins thus—“ Assured that man, individual man, may justly claim liberty as his birthright we naturally conclude, that, as a member of society, it becomes his indispensable duty to Preserve inviolate that liberty, for the benefit of his fellow citizens, and of his and their posterity
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11945 For, as in associating he gave up cer tain of his rights in order to secure the possession of the remainder, and! voluntarily yielded up only as much as was necessary for the general good, so he may not barter away the liberties of his posterity, nor desert the common cause, by tamely and supinely suffering to be purloined from the people, of whom he makes a part, their natural and unalienable rights of resistance (o oppression, and of shuring in the government of their country 3 without the fail and uninterrupted exercise of which rights, no man can, with truth, call himself or his country free. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11946 You will recollect, that, throughout every one of their papers, they have uniformly declared, that they considered the existing government of this country as an usurpation, and as an oppression
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11947 W hen, therefore, they declare their right of resistance to oppression, they declare their right of resistance to the existing government, which ri have declared to be an oppression; and all their proceedings are in direct conformity to that declaration. For the proceedings of the Scotch convention, and the resolutions of the twentieth of January, 1794, at the Globe-tavern, go upon this principle, the natural and unalienable right of resistance to oppression— So that they have only to call any act on the part of government oppression, and then, declaring their natural and unalicnable right of resistance to oppression, they declare their unalicnable right to resist that particular act. —They also declare their unalienable right of sharing in the government of their country —making use of the word government, as will be found in all their publications, instead of the expression in the duke of Richmond’s letter—“ sharing in the choice of those persons who are to make the laws by which they are to be governed. — The change is extremely remarkable, and is, in fact, a key to the whole. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11948 Then they resolve expressly, “ That every individual has a right to share in the government of that suciety of which he is a member
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11949 And their fourth resolution is, “ That the people of Great Britain are not effectually represented in parliament, not confining their resolution to the House of Commons ; and though certainly it is capable of that construction, yet that is not the natural construction of the words. Their seventh resolution is—“ That a fair, equal, and impartial representation can never take place till all partial privileges are abolished : — which seems a clear declaration of their mcaning.— For their first resolution is, “ ‘That every individual has a right to share in the government of that society of which he is a member, un less incapacitated ; which share in the government they could not possibly have, unless they had a voice at Icast in the eleetion of the persons who are to administer that government. — They fourthly resolve 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11950 4akh 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11951 —“ That the people of Great Britain are not effectually represented in parliament.’—And then they say, hat, in consequence of a partial, unequal, and therefore inadequate representation, together with the corrupt method in which representatives are elected, oppressive taxes, unjust laws, restrictions of liberty, and wasting of the public money, have ensued
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11952 And, in their seventh resolution, they say, “ That a fair, equal, and imPartial representation of the people in parliament, can never take place until all partial privileges are abolished ;—which partial privileges necessarily include the existence of the peerage as a part of the parliament. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11953 These resolutions, thercfure, when attended to and attcnded to purticularly with the comment which they themselves make upon them in their letters, and other proceedings, amount to a clear resolution, “ That every individual has a right to a share in the government of the country; —meaning a share in the election of those persons by whom that government is to be administered, legislative and executive ; and the fourth, sixth, and seventh resolutions, taken together, clearly show that they meant to have a wholly elective parliament. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11954 Gentlemen, their second address was published on the 24th of May, 1792: and in that address they state the sort of test, as it has been called, which they proposed to administer to every member, upon his admission. Now, the only ground upon which tests of any kind can possibly be supported is, that, in the administration of the government of a country, it is necessary, for the safety of that government, that the persons who compose the actugl administration of the government, should not be adverse to the principles upon which that government is formed : That isthe only ground, as it strikes me, upon which any test whatever can be supported. — But a test in a society which was to have for its object the fair discussion of the principles of government, seems the most extraordinary thing imaginable
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11955 Men are to enter into a society in which they are to declare what are their principles upon government, and -yet the society pretends to be formed for the purpose of discussing those principles, 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11956 The questions to be put to the membersbefore their admission, and to which they are to answer in the affirmative, are, “ First,— Are you convinced that the parliamentary meprescnialion of this country is at presentin-adequate and imperfect? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11957 “Secondly, are you thoroughly persuaded that the welfare of these kingdoms requires , that every person of adult years, in possession of his reason, and not incapacitated by crimes, should have a vote for a member of parliament? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11958 “ Thirdly, will you endeavour, by all justifable means, to promote such reformation in parliament ? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11959 Here, gentlemen, they bind, at once, all their members to one certain object, aud using all justifiable means; justifiable, you will observe, gentlemen, is a very lar word—“ all justifiable means to promote sua a reformation in parliament.—Is it, the, to be conceived, that the persons who became members of this society—I mean those who were the leading and directing members of 2 —meant that there should be, in any conve tion which they might assemble of the pecple, a full and fair. discussion of the subjet— that the present existing constitution of the country, in all, or any of its parts, should be tried in a fair deliberation—that the will aad wishes of the people should be taker yxa the subject 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11960 They could not possibly maa any such thing—they meant to establits tyranny of their own clubs—they meant establish these as assumed and positive pat ciples, not to be disputed—and which aloe were to govern all the deliberations of that Convention of the People, as they call it which they proposed to assemble. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11961 The report of their committee of consti tion states exactly the same resolution, wit this variation only, that the words, “ the wh fare of these kingdoms, are omitted: Why these words were omitted I think it is ox very difficult to discover, when one recollecs that in one of the letters which was from some society in the country, andwas afterwards published, the word kingems was altered for country, in two difierest places. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11962 Gentlemen, it is also clear, from that repot of the committee of constitution, to have just referred, that the persons composed this society, were fully aware, thi the opinions of a great majority of the pe ple of the country were not with For one of their resolutions is, that 0 majority, however great, can justly ce the minority of any part of their rights. Whenever it is attempted, the 3 bond is broken, and the minority havea right to resist —and this, is eae inky ae : of any part of their civilrights. en Hen, HE o. these civil rights? W y the fourth resolution is this, “ The civil rights every individual, are equality of voice 0 making of laws, and in the choice of the po sons by whom those laws are to be adminis 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11963 There they have expressly told you what they mean by the right of every individual to 4 shure in the government of that society of whi he isa member. It is not simply an equally of voice in making laws, but likewise in th choice of persons by whom those laws are to ke administered
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11964 Does the spirit of the British constitution, in any degree, permit the choie by the pcople of the persons by whom te laws are to be administered? Can a moe clear and explicit declaration of an intented to form a republic be made than this; “t! the civil rights of every individual, are q lity of voice in the making of laws, and the choice of persons by whom these laws at 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11965 -7 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11966 be administered; that every person has a right to exercise these rights, thatno majority, however great, can justly deprive the minority of any part of these rights, and that, whereever it is attempted, the social bond is broken, and the minority have a right to resist. I do not wonder that my learned friends did not make any observation upon this paper—It is impossible to make any effectual observation upon it, for the benefit of the prisoner, because the meaning is clear and plain, beyond the possibility of doubt. Here are persons declaring a principle so wild, that if it were to prevail, it would be impossible for any government to exist—It has generally been conceived, that it is a very strong thing to say that the majority have a right to alter the constitution of a government, at least without very strong necessity for it. A num‘ber of people are assembled in a country, whose whole habits, and connexions, lead them to wish to remain in that country, and they are assembled upon certain terms of association, which forms their constitution. Every individual has a sort of sacred right to the observance of the terms of that association; a right, at least as sacred as his right to the property which he possesses.—If it be his wish to continue to live under that constitution, it is injuring him as materially and as essentially to take away that constitution of government, as to take away his property. Undoubtedly cases of necessity may arise, in which that right must ‘be invaded, as rights of property, and every other right must be invaded, in cases of necessity—even the right which every man has to his own life—you must remember the case which is commonly put, of two men being upon a plank in the sea, and the plank proves capable of supporting only one of them. It is said, that the stronger would be justified perhaps in the “ I confess, gentlemen, waa overcome with the dreadful alternative to which that man must be reduced—It is commonly observed, that it would be justifiable for the stronger, in that situation, to push the weaker from the plank, for his own preservation. But, gentlemen, if we feel so much when a man is reduced to such a dreadful situation, and feel that nothing but absolute necessity can justify the act which he does—what can justify men, who without a very strong necessity, shall attempt to disturb the established poverrunentt of any country, in which any large proportion of the in retain the government so established 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11967 but what shall we say to men who carry the principle to this length—not content with denying that even a large majority of the country ought not to alter the established government of it, against the. consent of the minority, ; 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11968 without extreme necessity — but asserting that no majority, however great, can justly deprive the minority, of any part of their civil tights; that whenever it is attempted, the social bond is broken, and the minority have a right to resist; and assuming at the same time, as one of those civil rights, the right of equality of voice in the making of laws, and in the choice of persons by whom those laws are to be administered? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11969 Is not this a declaration, clear and plain, that they conceive they have an unquestionable right to resist any government which is not a republican government, founded upon their principles of universal representation ; and that any other government is so unlawful that they are not only not bound to give it support, but that they have a right to resist it to the utmost of their power, and in any manner in which they think fit to resist it? this is a principle which teaches rebellion against every government not founded upon their plan, and yet told that men who hold such principles, who come to solemn resolutions upon them, are men who have a perfect reverence for the monarchy of this country, for the hereditary peerage, for every part of the government of the country, except the corrupt representation in the House of Commons. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11970 Gentlemen, the address of this society of the 6th of August, 1792, proceeds exactly upon the same principles; and when you consider these addresses and resolutions in the report of the committee of constitution, I think you cannot have a doubt in your own minds that every thing which tends the other way in any part of their publications, is what the attorney general represented it to be, a mere veil to cover their designs; but so thin, so thread-bare, and so tattered, that the naked limb is starting outevery moment. This address of the 6th of August 1792, begins with those lines from Thompson which my learned friend read so well. Who will dispute any one principle which it contains? and yet, if passages are to be taken from books, and applied to such purposes, the best books may be perverted to the worst of purses. No book has been more perverted to Pad purposes than the bible. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11971 This address of the Corresponding Society to the inhabitants of Great Britain, on the subject of a parliamentary reform, begins thus— Uninfluenced by party pique, or selfish motives, no ways affrighted at the frowns of power—not in the least awed by the evidently hostile preparations of much alarmed aristocracy.’—Here conveying, for the first time, that idea which you afterwards see developed with-so much success, and which was to end in arming their own bars yon will observe the idea is here completely developed—“ not in the least axed by the hostile preparations of a much alarmed aristocracy—we, the London 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11972 Corresponding Society, united with a view of obtaining a thorough parliamentary reform, anxiously demand your serious and most collected attention, to the present vitiated state of the British government. We entreat you to examine coolly, and impartially, the numerous abuses that prevail therein, their destructive consequences on the poor, and their evil tendency on all: as also the rapidity with which these abuses increase both in number and magnitude. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11973 Gentlemen, I think you will observe, that in all the addresses, and in all the papers of these societies, there has been a great attempt to excite the poor to be of their side ; to interest the poor in their tavour, and to represent the poor as the great objects of their attention; to bold out, that their wishes were principally for the relief of the poor—Mr. Paine’s works, have many passages to this effect; and in Various other parts of this cause you must have observed the suggestion of the same ideas. In one of the letters which I shall byand-by observe upon (a letter of Margarot’s) the distinction is drawn for the very same purpose, between the poor and the rich— where he says “the rich are arming, why should not the poor do the same ? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11974 This address of the Corresponding Society, having urged the various abuses, prevailing in the British government, proceeds; “ we next submit to your examination, an effectual mode of putting a stop to them, and of thereby restoring to our no less boasted than imPaired constitution, its pristine vigour and purity ; and we thereuntg warmly solicit the Junction of your efforts with ours. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11975 “ This great end, however, we believe attainable solely by the whole nation, deeply impressed with a sense of its wrongs, uniting, and as it were with one voice demanding, of those 10 whom for a while it has entrusted its sovereignty, a restoration of annually elected parliaments, unbiassed, and unbought elections, and an egual representation of the whule body of the people. You will recollect that these are words frequently made use of— words which admit of different interpretation. But gentlemen, it strikes me that this very address contains completely that interpretation which the society themselves meant should be put upon the words, 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11976 Having proceeded to state the situation of the different persons of this country, and especially the poor, they say, “ Such being the forlorn situation of three fourths of the nation how are Britons to obtain information ant redress?Will the Court — will ministry aftord either 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11977 will parliament grant them ? —will the nobles, or the clergy, ease the people’s suffering? No—experience tells us, and proclamations confirm it, that the interest and the intention of power, are combined to keep the nation in torpid ignorance. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11978 Gentlemen, you will observe how this is echoed back in all the letters from the country societies. For men, who use such expressions, to state, that they are men who have it in their view to obtain, from the existing legislature of the country, that alteration an the constitution which they propose, seems to me to be perfectly absurd. I would observe too, here, upon one part of this address, where it notices proclamations; because ut has been urged, by the counsel for the priso ner, that, those who have been engaged in these transactions, were never made aware that they were acting improperly. Why, gentlemen, in that jamation which is bere Noticed, and in a variety of other acts of vernment, it was clearly and expliciuy clared to them, that they were (&king steps which might lead to the most dangerous consequences. It was pointed out to them, that those who had the direction of government, conceived that the safety of the state was in danger; that there was a conspiracy formed to subvert the constitution of the country; that a reform in the representaticn of parks ment was 4 mere pretence; and that the object of the conspirators went infinitely beyond that. This they were distinctly told, over and over again, in a variety of ways. Even the various associations, as they term them, of the rich, showed that the rich apprehended the same danger? that they conceived there was an intention to make that sort of alters tion ia the constitution of the government which must be subversive of its principles, and destructive to their rights of property. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11979 Under these circumstances, oughta society, who had only in view a reforin in parliament, by clear and specific regulations, applying merely to the House of Commons, ought they to have expressed themselves in such lap guage? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11980 They proceed : “ The only resource then, friends and fellow citizens, will be found m those societies, which, instituted with a view to the public good, promote a general instruc tion of our rights as men, expose the abuses of those in power, and point out the only com Stitutional, the only effectual means of for warding a public investigation, and obtaining acom plete redress for a people, in whose credulous good nature originated their preseat difficulties. Clearly and directly pointing to that convention, which has since been attempted to be established. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11981 Gentlemen, this address likewise pointsout the very same thing which is noticed in the answer to the Norwich letter which indeed refers to thisaddress. The address says,“ Yet, fellow citizens! numerous as our grievances, andclose rivetted as weighty the shackles on our eedom, reform one alone, and the others will all disappear. If we once regain ar annually elected parliament, and that parliament to be fairly fie by all, the people will again share in the government of their country, and thet then unbought, unbiassed euffrages must ut doubtedly select a majority of honest members. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11982 Gentlemen, the answer (you will obeerve) to the Norwich letter, says,—‘ Leave Momerchy, Democracy, and even Religion entirely aside; never dispute on these topics ; let endeavours go to increase the number of who wish for a full and equal representation of the people, and leave to a parliament so chosen, to form plans for remedying the existing abuees. The letter, therelDre’ to the Norwich Society, commenting on this Address, shows you what they meant. It shows you, that they meant, in their words, to leave Mo. narchy and Democracy alone; but to hold out that. which they thought, under the cover of language, they mi y hold out ; and, at the same time, keeping clearly in view the destruction of Monarchy, and the establishment of Democracy, of which you cannot possibly have a shadow of doubt, when you consider the terms of that letter, the terms of this address, and the particular passages which Thave read from the report of the committee of constitution. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11983 Gentlemen, there are two things contained in this address, which struck me in a very extraordinary manner. One is, the description of what they conceived such a parliament (an elected parliament) as they describe, would do, when assembled. They say, that such a parliament, “ Finding that a most extruordinary waste of public money had taken place under the different pretences of places, Pensions, contracts, armaments, subsidies, secret service money, exc. our honest and atinual parliament would, after narrowly scrutinizing the same, retrench every sum needlessly or wickedly laid out. You will observe, this passage refers to a waste of public money, which Aad taken place, and says, this elected parliament would retrench every sum needlessly or wickedly laid out—not that it would prevenit, in future, improper expenses. Gentlemen, I leave to you to make the comMent upon that passage. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11984 The other passage which particularly struck me, is also a passage which speaks for itself, and which I take to he exactly of the same description as that which I last mentioned. — he people’s parliament finding, that, under Varlous pretences, grants of common land had been obtained by sundry persons, no ways to the benefit of the community, but very much to the distress of the pour, the same would be s00n restored to the public, and the robbed peasant again enabled annually to supply his disfamily with an increased quantity of bread, out of the profit arising from the liberty regained, of grazing a cow, two or three Sheep, ora brood of geese thereon. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11985 What can that possibly mean, but that all those commons, which, under the gencral cousentof persons interested, under the authority of acts of parliament, or in any other Manner, have been enclosed, improved, and divided, should, under pretence of restoring the rights of the poor, be taken from the present proprietors, and divided amongst those poor, for the perpese of engaging them in the Party? If it be possible to give any other con“truction to that paragraph, I wish you to do ts but my mind is incapable of giving it any other construction, and I think there cannot be an idea more destructive to private property. For under the same pretence, the whole property in land of every person in the country, might be destroyed. I cannot form a calculation of the immense quantity of land, which, within even the last twenty years, was common land, and is now become separate and enclosed, ee the faith of which inclosures, persons have laid out large sums of Money in improvements and bui! dings; and, generally speaking, those who had rights of common, had their rightscompensated in some way or other. Whatever injustice may have been, in particular instances (supposing any such to have been), if once an attempt is made to unsettle rights gained in such a manner, and so established, all right of property is necessarily in danger. If you once attack the principles on hick rights of property have been established, you must go on till you will destroy all right of property, and do exactly what has been done in France. For there, under the pretence of the rights of the public, an immense quantity of property, which had been granted, from a vast distance of time, by the crown, to individuals—as half the estates in this country are, perhaps, held under grants from the crown, although, perhaps, those pant cannot be actually traced—was taken tom the possessors, and given to the publie. The first French National Assembly, that Constituting Assembly which acted in many cases very properly, was guilly of the gross injustice of taking into the hands of the public, large quantities of land, from great numbers of persons, which had been purchased and acquired in various ways, because they said, the lands had been originally improperly granted. —Here the expression is, “ improper grants land which may easily be applied to lands formerly granted by the crown, and indeed to the title of every person’s estate. This lure is held out, unquestionably, for the purpose of gaining the poorer sort of people. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11986 These are two striking passages in this address
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11987 One referring to a subject, upon which I make no comment, but leave it to you to make acomment.—Upon the other I have ventured to make a comment.—It seems to me, that, by it, the title to all property is put in hazard, and I will call to your attention a part of the evidence which applies particularly to the subject. I allude to that part of Lynam’s evidence, with respect to the divisions in Spitalfields. 1 only wish you to bear that in mind now,—I mean particularly to notice it hereatter,—to bear in mind the relation which that evidence has to this passage. You will recollect, the Spitalfields divisions were considered as likely to produce as many members as all the then existing members of the society, and they were to be supported by assistance from the other divisions, because they were considered us persons of that description to whom the smal] subscriptions that were to be made, ofa penny a week, by other members of this society, might be inconvenient; and then judge, whether that which I have suggested, was not a part of the general plan. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11988 Gentlemen, you will also recollect, that, if what Lynam stated upon that subject is untrue, there could have been no difliculty whatever in contradicting bim; and, therefore, whatever reflections may be thrown upon him, or upon spies, or any other persons, you must believe that to be true; because, when a person is accused of having concurred in a transaction, by evidence, which is capable of being contradicted by a great number of persons, and not one of them is called to contradict that evidence, you must give credit necessarily to the accusation; and its not being contradicted, when it might be so easily contradicted, if false, gives it a confirmation beyond all doubt. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11989 This address statcs, that, ‘“‘ Numerous other reforms would undoubtedly take place, even in the first session of a parliament, so elected, dependent only on their electors, the people, untorn therefore by faction, undivided by party, uncorrupted by ministry, and uninfluenced but by the public good
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11990 Apassage which, as I before observed, is utterly inconsistent with the existence of a House of Peers; referring to a parliament, which is described as wholly elected in the manner mentionedin this paper, and as dependent only on their electors, the poerls, the very object of the House of Peers eing to have a middle body in the constitution of the government, which should not be so elected, but being of a different description, should form a barrier between each of the two other powers, the King and the Commons, and keep the balance even between both, as one or other may preponderate. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11991 It is a remarkable thing in the history of the constitution of this country, that the time when the liberties of the country were most in danger, from the over-bearing influence of the crown, was immediately after the close of the civil wars between the Houses of York and Lancaster, when almost all the great families in the country had been extinguished by the accidents attending those wars; many falling in the field, and on the scaffold, and many being ruined by confiscations; so that, according to my recollection, when Henry 7th ascended the throne, there remained only about thirty peers in the parliament. And he, wisely, seeing the advantage which this accident gave him, scarcely added at all to the number of peers, the consequence of which was, that there was not that middle body to stand between the crown and the people, and all the dangerous exercise of power, every thing which Ted to that which was afterwards done by Charles ist, will be found to have originated in the government of Henry 7th, aud bis son Henry 8th, whilst the peerage of the country was in that situation, that, from the number of the members of which it was composed, they did not form that barrier which it was intended they should orm. ‘ 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11992 Gentlemen, I have now, at a length to which I certainly did not intend to go, com mented upon the establishment of the London Corresponding Society, upon its addresses, and upon its constitution ; and it seems to me, that this alone would be very sufficient to show, that the object and the intention, that the formed resolution fer I think we do it injustice when we call it intention, o opinion, or conception), that the formed ravlution of these societies, that is, of the leadng members of them, was, to establish, in ths country, a democratical form of government; a form of government more democratical than that which ever existed in any other counuy —unless we conceive that it exists now i France—utterly incompatible with, and therfore necessarily destroying, the monarchal part of our government; and therefore, als, a clear demonstration of a tonspiracy depose the king; and any act, taken in pr suance of that conspiracy, is unquestionably an act of high treason. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11993 Gentlemen, in the course of these transrtions, there was one very artful proceeding; which was, I believe, ohserved upon by the attorney general. The society for Corstte tional Information met every Friday; the delegates of the Corresponding Society me every Thursday. The advantage was, tx Society for Constitutional Information were to hold themselves up as persons of reset: able situations; all violent resolutions wer therefore to begin, either in the country 9cieties, or in Scotland, or they were to in the London Corresponding Society— committee of delegates of the London Caresponding Society, came to resolutions 0 the Thursday, which, on-the Friday, they generally communicated to the Society , Constitutional Information. And here another strong'proof, how perivetly aristocrabt the government of this democratical soaely was. For a measure was to be resolved up2. first, by their secret committee ; then to the committee of delegates, andupon there; which committee of delesies necessarily acted, in a certain degree, bhodly upon the reports of the committee of com pondence, because they did mot know all hecorrespondence that passed ; being adoptthere, they were not to wait for an adophod of it’ by the rest of the members of te society ; it was to be reported, indeed, athe different division meeti but that might not have happened till the resolution| taken place; because. those division were upon the different days, which were mast convenient for the different divisions to me and yet, on the Friday, without any referee to the division meetings, the resolutions to be carried to the Constitutional Society, athe proceedings of the London Co Society. wa 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11994 Gentlemen, that letter from Sheffield, oe I before adverted to, I now see is dale 15th of October, 1792; from the editer 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11995 Patriot ; and there, speaking of the establishment of several socicties, it says—“ We beg leave also to throw in our mite of commendation, of the laudable spirit which you have evinced in your intention to address the National Convention of France, and ho sincerely, that your example will be followed by all the societies in the two kingdoms; Ireland having already set the example— then it says ‘ we hope your society will also give them (a particular society, which is named, the Stockport Society) “ your sanction, advice, and support; as it will be in vain for 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11996 ’ the friends of reform, to contend with the tremendous host of enemies they have to encounter,—clearly showing, that they considered that avery large propurtion indeed (and some of the other letters expressly stating, that a vast majority) of the people, were against them. It goes on—“ We clearly foresee, that Scotland will soon take the lead of this country—(I wish you, gentlemen, to observe this) “ and conceive it will be necessary to take the greatest care, that an universal communication should be constantly kept up, between the several societies, however distant, and that all should determine to act upon the same principle, and move together, as near as may be in regular and activeunison. ’Twas by this method, France becume so thoroughly united, and we ought never to lose sight of it. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11997 Now, can any government subsist, which has within its bosom a number of societies acting as a corporate body upon those principles? What, gentlemen, 18 a government, anda state, but a corporation 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11998 It isa number of men, assembled by certain constitutions of union, by which those who are of themselves individuals, are enabled to act as one body. When therefore a society is established, and that society puts itself under particular Tegulations, that society, to a certain extent, though not bound in the same manner as a Corporation created by the lawful government, 1s in effect a corporation ; and when a number of societies unite themselves in the manner here Proposed, they are a union of distinct corporations, Corporations created by the Constitution and government of the country, acting under the authority of that constitution, are subordinate states. The East India 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11999 Ompany, for instance, is a corporation, by means of which our possessions in the East Indies, to a certain degree, are governed. That is a corporation, acting in subordination to the great corporation of this country; which, lord Coke says, is composed of King, Lords, and Commons, of which the King is thehead. He calls it, expressly, the great Corporation of this country. Then here, upon the principle of incorporation, are a great Humber o! societies, united together, for the Purpose of moving together in regular active unison ; for the purpose of furming themselves Into one state, which should act together, upon one principle; a sort of combination of states, like the United States of America, which still have one regular constitution, which regulates the whole government. A country may bear a corporation or state within it, which is in avowed subordination to it, such as the different corporations in this kingdom ; because it has a power to regulate their actions by the proceedings of the courts of justice. If the exceed their power in any degree, it calls them in question, and they may, if they go to certain lengths, forfeit the privileges granted to them. Such corporations are completely within the power of the government, and are capable of existing consistently with the safety of it. But such corporations as these, cannot exist in any government, with safety to that government. It is, imperium in imperio, which is inconsistent with any government. This was the very principle upon which the National Assembly in France, in 1791, passed a decree against the Jacobin clubs, which unfortunately for that country, was never put in execution. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12000 We object to these socicties, “ you are acting as a corporation—you are taking upon yourselves the firmness, union, and manner of acting, which belongs to a corporate}bady, which makes you therefore a state within a state, and renders the existence of your society, totally incompatible with public peace. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12001 The celebrated specch made by one of the most distinguished members of the French constituent assembly, Mons. D’Andre, a man of considerable ability, states this in so clear and plain a light, that it must bring conviction to the mind of every man, that the government of a country cannot exist, if there subsist within it, such a set of associated and affiliated societies, acting as a corporate body, in opposition to that government, in the manner in which these socicties proposed to do. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12002 In all these transactions, the prisoner unquestionably has borne a very distinguished part; and you will find that his letters, if you take the trouble of referring to them, certainly show his privity with every part of the transaction. A privity which must necessatily also be inferred from his situation of secretary, with every part of the transactions. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12003 Gentlemen, you recollect a letter of the prisoner, to Mr. Vaughan, of the 9th of April, 1792, in which he particularly states, in what manner he conceived the minds of the people were to be acted upon; the manner in which they were to be allured and deluded; and advises Mr. Vaughan to collect some choice flowers from several publications which he refers to. You will recollect, also, that the gentleman to whom that letter was addressed, although present in court, has not been called to explain any of the transactions which have taken place. That letter was very early in the transactions stated tu you, and shows most clearly, and plainly, that the prisoner was at the very foundation and root of every thing—He was not a perf0n who was deluded and led away—He wassend a deputation to that meeting, I havem one whose whole heart was in the cause, and who was contriving all the delusions which are imputed to the persons who were concerned in these transactions. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12004 These things having been done, and the, people having been by such means considerably set against the constitution established in the country, the leaders of these societies began to consider what measures they should take. There had been for some time in Scotland, a number of societies, which had been acting upon the same principles, and holding a correspondence with the London Corresponding Society; and these societies in Scotland had formed a meeting, called a Convention of Delegates, which had met early in the year 1793, and had then adjourned, I think to November 1793. These ople, when they originally met, appear to Fave had exactly the views which were steted by my friend who last addressed you, as the views of the London Societies
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12005 They did not assume to be a Convention of the People; they described themselves as a meeting of delegates of the different socicties asSociated for the purpose of ong a parliamentary reform—they met—they did their business—they dispersed and adjourned to meet again in November. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12006 During this interval, you will observe that avery private and particular correspondence took place. There isa letter from Skirvin to Hardy, of the 25th of May, 1793
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12007 I shall have occasion to observe something more upon the subject; but I would now observe, doubt but our society would, with pleasm, accept the invitation; and I ampersuade it woulddo much good. Our freedom, as yo: justly observe, depends entirely upon cuselves, and upon our availing ourselves uf th: opportunity, which, once lost, may nut be soon recovered.’—And I observe upon tis, because I think it tends to show, that, how ever unprepared they might be to carry te measures they had in view, into complete er ecution, they had a strong impression upa their minds, that, if they lost the opportunty, which to a certain degree they concerred they then had, they should not be able vn cover it again; and that therefore it waste cessary, at all events, to take some steps. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12008 This letter of the 5th of October, 17, having been written by Mr. Hardy, a lena came trom Mr. Skirving to him, in an offical way, Seating that those deputies might i sent
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12009 This letter is communicated, not ctl; to the London Corresponding Society, bot t the Society for Constitutional Informatica; and in consequence of that communication. both these societies sent delegates to ths Scotch Convention—And, gentlemen, yu will recollect, that, by the communicata with Sheffield, Norwich, and other places, they were likewise induced to send 1o the same convention. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12010 These are the instructions given by te London Corresponding Society, which wer signed by the prisoner : “ The articles of instruction given to citizen Joseph Gem. delegate from the London Corresponding S

SOLICITORGENERAL 12012 for the purpose of reform
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12013 This letter led to 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12014 “ First—He shall on no account depat a private correspondence between Mr. Hardy, from the original object and principles of th the prisoner, and Mr. Skirving, who had been secretar. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12015 Society; namely, the obtaining annual prrations! 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12016 to that meeting of delegates in| liaments, and universal suffrage, by

SOLICITORGENERAL 12019 tion of the People ;’—an appellation and character which, for the purposes stated by my learned friend, were totally unnecessary. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12020 On the 5th of October, 1793, Mr. Hardy writes a letter to Mr. Skirving, in which he speaks of the trials of Muir and Palmer, who had heen prosecuted for seditious conduct, and then says, he General Convention which you mention, eppears to Mr. Margarot, to whom alone I have communicated your fetter, (the letter to which this refers, seems to have been dated the 2nd of October; but it has not been fuund) “ appears to Mr. Margarot and myself to be a very excellent measure; and, as such, I could wish you, without delay, to communicate it officially to our society, without any ways mentioning that you had written to me privately. —I mentioned this letter before
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12021 I now state it for the purpose of introducing the sending delegates to the Scotch Convention.—« If, in struction.—For, after it had been state 2 the report of their committee of constitsto:, that the minority had a right to resist the majority, for the pu of asserting, wist they call, their indefeasible rights, soot which they claim the right of equal, active citizenship; rational and la: messs sft any means which would be, according to bet idea of reason, rational, and, according to thet idea of law, lawful. They declare itto be lawful for the minority to resist the majesty, if the effect of the tyranny, as they callit, et ercised by the majority, were to deprive of their indefeasible civil rights; nemelf? share in the government of their coutty, both legislative and executive. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12022 The other instructions are, “ He is directed to support the representatives in parliamncst oug! by their constituents. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12023 “ Thirdly—That the election 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12024 Toke of deri your official letter, you should require us toought to be restored to the people.

SOLICITORGENERAL 12027 “ etathy—thet the liberty of the press must at all events be supported ; and that the publication of political truths can never be criminal. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12028 Now, gentlemen, you will observe that the four last of these have no connexion whatever with a parliamentary refurm
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12029 The second is only supporting the opinion, that representatives in parliament ought to be paid by their constituents — an opinion formerly adopted, and acted upon, in this country, but long since abandoned, from a principle of policy, which is obvious; and the adoption of that opinion by the first constituent assembly in France, led, perhaps, toall the mischicf that followed. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12030 When persons talk of rational and lawful means, you must of necessity understand them to use those words in the sense, and according to the construction which they themselves put upon the words. They say, that their delegate should on no account depart from the principles of the socicty; namely, the obtaining annual parliaments and universal suffrage, ‘by rational and lawful means—In the seventh instruction, they state what they conceive to be lawful means; namely, “ Thatit is the duty of the people to Tesist any act of parliament repugnant to the original prineiples of the constitution, as would be every attempt to prohibit associations for the purpose of reform
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12031  And therefore bier considered, that any act of parliament, and consequently any authority whatever, however in the common estimation of mankind it might be deemed lawful, was to be resisted by them, if it tended to prevent the execution of their purpose; and that, therefore, any means taken towards such resistance, were means taken for the purpose of obtaining annual parliaments, and universal suffrage, by rational and lawful means. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12032 It seems to me, therefore, that these articles of instruction, upon the very face of them, import a determination to resist the constituted power and authority of the country, ifa resistance to this constituted power was necessary to carry into execution their obtaining annual parliaments, and universal suffrage, by rational and lawful means ; and that they considered resistance to the power of the constituted authorities, as lawful means to effect that purpose
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12033 And, if they considered resistance as lawful means, it necessatily also follows, that they considered attack as lawful means.—For, if resistance is lawful, an attack to supersede the necessity of resistance, is also lawful.—Upon what principle is attack in war lawful, but that resistance is justifiable ? And attack is justifiable for the purpose of a lia the necessity of that resistance—Therefore these instructions do 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12034 Pope of 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12035 ‘most explicitly declare their resolution to maintain the object which they had in view, by what they call rational and lawful means ; which they have sufticiently shown jo be such acts as are in direct opposition to the constituted authority of the country, and, consequently, acts of rebellion. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12036 Gentlemen, when this again is compared with the report of their committee cf constitution; and when I have shown that their avowed principle is rebellion against every government which is not constituted in the manner in which they say a government ought to be constituted, it is impossible to give any other construction to these words, “rational and lawful means, than that which I have given; namely, such means as, by the exercise of their reason, unprejudiced, they were taught to believe were lawful means ; among which they included the right of the. minority to resist even a vast majority of the country, if that majority attempted to withhold from them those rights which they considered as indefeasible civil rights: namely, a right to shure in the whole of the government of their country, as well executive as legislative. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12037 Gentlemen, the instructions which are given to the delogates of the Society for Conj Stitutional Information, are couched, unques‘tionably, in much more cautious language.They contain no such resolution with respectto resistance, as is contained in the resolutions of the London Corresponding Society
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12038 At the same time you will recollect, what my learned friend near me now suggests to me, that allthat was done in the Scotch Convention, in consequence of the instructions given to the delegates of the London Corresponding Society, was afterwards fully approved by the Society for Constitutional Information; and that one of the acts so done, was in direct conformity to those instructions (the seventh instruction) “ That it is the duty of the people to resist any act of parliament repugnant to the original principles of the constitution, as would be every attempt to prohibit associations for the purpose of reform. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12039 Gentlemen, you will recollect that one of the resolutions of this Scotch Convention went directly upon the foundation of that ine struction ; going, indeed, considerably beyond it; and when I am told that persons who send delegatcs, are to be considered as giving to those delegates no other authority than what they specifically gave them, I admit ; that to a certain degree, that is true; but then, the moment they know that these delegates go beyond their authority, they ought, unquestionably, at least, to disavow them
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12040  But what has this Constitutional Society done? Instead of disavowing any proceedingsof the British Convention, it has declared its approbation of them all; and the society has considered itself as bound to give the most effectual support to the persons who came to these resolutions. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12041 Then what were the proceedings of this as
SOLICITORGENERAL 12042 4.1L 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12043 sembly when it met
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12044 Gentlemen, I shall not go through all their proceedings because that would take up infinitely too large a portion of your time ; but there are some few of their proceedings upon which I shall venture to comment : In the first place I would notice their declaring themselves “ the British Convention of the People.—For the purpose which itis pretended they hadin view, that declaration was absolutely unnecessary—not only absoJutely unnecessary, but it was improper ; because if they were to convey to the parliament ofthe country, what the opinions of men were upon the subject, opinions conveyed by delegation are, in all cases, totally improper ; but opinions conveyed by delegation, where the persons specifically delegating do not appear, are still more improper. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12045 Af ithad been described as a meeting of the societies of Sheffield—of the societies of London—of the societies of Norwich, and so on; describing them in this way, there would have een a possibility of ascertaining of whom they were composed
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12046 It woul also have been just within possibility, and nothin; more, that the delegates should convey the sentiments of those persons whe composed the several societies with respect to the subject of a reform in the House of Commons.— But it would have been certainly, a very incomplete method of conveying those sentiments.—For, you see, the delegate from the Society for Constitutional Information would have appeared to have conveyed the sentiments of Mr. Sheridan, and several other persons, whose names are still upon the books, as members of the Constitutional Society, though they have not attended the society for many years, and have really had nothing to do with it for several years.—Therefore these societies conld in fact, convey to parliament nothing more than the opinion of those Particular men who took active parts in the societies respectively ; and when their detegates in Scotland assumed to themselves the character of “ the convention of the people, and professed to convey the opinions of the people, they must have practised an imposition upon the parliament; for they were only a meeting of delegates, chosen by a few members of these societies, and had no right to represent themselves in the character of a Convention of the People, for the purpose of conveying to parliament the sentiments of the people of this country, as desiring a parliamentary reform. It was therefore not only Panes but absolutely improper, that they should assume the character of a Convention of the People.—For what purpose did they assume that appellution a—It could only be for the purpose of assuming the character of a convention of the people, and the power which is necessarily attributable to a real convention of the people? and, I conceive, that is the only purpose for which you will believe they did assume jt. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12047 The purpose suggested by the learned and 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12048 [igs ingenious counsel, is one that cannot have been within their view. It would have been totally inconsistent, even with their ovn principles, to have pretended to convey to the parliament of this country, by means of the opinions of a number of aslestes of the diffe. rent societies; the opinions of the pes the persons so delegated having clearly no right whatever to state, that what they resolved upon, was any thing more than the opinion of a variety of clubs, or rather of some of the several individual members who composd those clubs
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12049 But the evidence given of the conversations with Mr. Yorke, puts this beyond all sort of doubt : He said, “ The Brtish Convention split upon a rock—becmse they declared themselves a venared fe the people, before the people were prepared for it; that thet maak fret to have come forward with an address to the people at large;’"— That is, that they ought to have continued ia their original character ofa convention of de legates of the different societies, till, bya address to the people at large, they had pee pared the minds of the people at large for the declaration, that they were a convention the people, in order to obtain that sort of tacit consent to their declaration, which ms obtained in France, to a declaration of the same sort, by some of the members of the states-general.—Those persons, on the of June, 1789, being till then only membes of the states-general of the kingdom, s sembled under the authority of the king, according to the ancient constitution of France, and therefore, acting under that subordimtion to his authority which the ancient ao stitution of France required, declared theaselves a National Assembly ; and, THEREFOR, that the king could put no negative upon ther authority.—If they had not been supported by the people in that declaration, they could not have acted in the character in which they thea assumed to act; but the people did them, and the public mind being pre| support them as a convention ef the and to give them all the force, the strength, and efficiency of such a convention, from that time, they did act as a convention of the pecple, assembled by sufficient authority; from that time, they were completely the vereign power of the state. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12050 Mr. Yorke said, and truly, that the conver tion at Edinburgh, had declared itself a cot vention of the people, before the people were Prepared to acknowledge them as such; that they had thereby split upon a rock, been able to carry their intentions intoexect tion, and had therefore failed ; that they to have addressed the public at large up? the subject, and thus to have pre the public mind; and if they found the ready to support them in the charecter convention, which they meant to assume, to declare themselves such, and to assume the power and superiorities, and all the & thoritiesof a convention of the people. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12051 Gentlemen this assembly of delegates of clubs, having proceeded in this manner, thought proper, not only to call itself a Convention of the People, a British Convention of the People, necessarily including the whole island, but the BRITISH CONVENTION, ONE AND INDIVISIBLE, and to date their transactions, the first year of the British Convention, One and Indivisible. What could this be meant to express, but that they considered themselves as the whole people of Great Britain, united, by delegation, in one common cause, not to be separated—not to be divided, until they had completely and effectually cartied into execution those purposes which the several delegates carried with them into this assembly 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12052 What the purposes of Margarot and Gerrald were, we have had clearly before us upon evidence. What was the purpose of Mr. Yorke, who, though a delegate from the Constitutional Society, did not actually go,— we may infer, from all that he did and said elsewhere. Now, that the whole is disclosed, and all its complex parts are put together, it is clear that this very act was, initself anact of High treason—And I beg to say, that the Attorney General, in his place in the House of Commons, on the question relative to the trials in Scotland, declared, that as far as he could then view it, seeing it imperfectly as he did, he was inclined strongly to think, that it ought to have been soconstrued. But an act may be an act of high treason, or an actof sedition, merely, according to the degree of evidence which may be produced upon the subject. Unless you can show, what was the object of the parties, you ma: Not be able to prove it to be an act of hig treason, although, in fact it was so. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12053 What was the argument which Mr. Gibbs pressed so much upon you? He did not deny, that the acts of his client were extremely blameable ; very seditious ; but thty do not, said he, amount to high treason. And why did he assert, that they did not amount to high treason? ‘“ Because the evidence, taken together, does not show that the prisoner had conceived, within his mind, the guilty purpose and intent of destroying the government of the country, deposing the king, and establishing a democratic government in its stead. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12054 In the prosecutions carried on in Scotland. against the members of the British Convention, Margarot, Gerrald, Skirving, and the rest, the full evidence was not possessed by those who prosecuted ; they could not establish, by evidence, that degree of criminality inthe minds of the parties, which is essentially necessary for the purpose of constituting the crime of high treason ; and, therefore, No blame is upon that account imputable, as I contend, to the courts in Scotland, supposing the act to be high treason. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12055 The courts there are accused of having heen over rigorous in their sentences
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12056 It that which has appeared in evidence here, had appeared to them, I think, according to the evidence which would then have been before them, they must have considered the acts as amounting to high treason; and it would have been their duty to have taken care that the persons, guilty of those acts, should hare been prosecuted accordingly. But from the evidence before them, the complete criminal intent did not appear, and therefore they proceeded, according to the law of Scotland, for the crime of sedition. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12057 The question which was afterwards principally agitated, was, whether there existed, in the law of Scotland, a distinct crime, denominated by the law of Scotland, “ Sedition, which the law of England considers as a mere misdemeanor, of different degrees of heinousness, till it amounts to the crime of high treason. Butif there did exist that distinction between treason and sedition, in the law of Scotland (and sedition, in the ancient law of England, seems to have been considered as a distinct crime, in very remote times), and if sedition in Scotland was capable of being punished as such, a very severe punishment must be the proper punishment for a crime which arose to that height, that the only question which could possibly be made upon it was, whether it did, or did not, amount to the heinous crime of high treason. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12058 Gentlemen, the resolutions and proceedings of this society in Scotland are very extraordinary; they begin with declaring themselves the British Convention, and their several proceedings have been read to you, in which itappears that they corresponded with the prisonerat the bar, and with several other persons. It also appears that they adopted several of the most seditious proceedings which have been had in this country, and that they had reports made to them of the state of the societies in England, as well as in Scotland, the object of which was to justify their declaring themselves a convention of the people. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12059 It appears in the proceedings of the 6th of November, 1793, that one of the Edinburgh delegates having moved that the London delegates should state the situation of their societies, citizen Margarot answered, ‘that the 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12060 “ I apprehend that this statement of the question is not strictly correct. The doctrines asserted by the counsel for the crown and sanctioned by the high court of ssticianys in the cases of Maurice Margarot and the other members of the British Convention, respecting the crime of sedition, have been much canvassed and by many distinguished lawyers impugned ; the true grounds on which the propriety of the decision of the court of justiciary has been questioned, will be found in the ingenious and powerful arguments which were delivered by the very learned and able persons who disputed the relevancy of the indictment in the case of Joseph Gerrald. Sce the speeches of Mr. Gillies and Mr. Laing in this Collection, vol. 38, pp. 827. 69. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12061 societies in London were very nuincrous, though sometimes tluctuating—in some parts of England whole towns are reformers; in Sheflicld and environs there are fifty thousand,"—thouch it has been shown to you that the society there never consisted of more than six hundred. thirty socicties in one. If, said Margarot, “ we could get a convention of England and Scotland called, we might represent six or seven hundred thousand inales, which is a majority of all the adults in the kingdom, and ministry would not dare to refuse us our rights. It was in consequence of this representation that they thought fit to give themselves the title which [have stated to you. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12062 Gentlemen, you will recollect that in their Proceedings they went to the extent of making a new union between England and Scotland; an union which should perfectly remove all boundaries of distinction between ‘the two kingdoms. Whether that would or would not be a wise thing, may certainly ad- 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12063 mit of a great deal of question; but there is a contract existing between the two countries upon the subject, and the persons assembled at this meeting, take upon themselves, as far as their authority goes, to break through that contract, assuming a power of a most extraordinary kind; not only sovereign power, but Sovereigu pene tending to the destruction of a solenin league between the two nations, at One time separate, distinct, and independent sovereign powers. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12064 They resolved to publish an address to the ; 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12065 public, and a committee. was appointed to consider the means, and to draw up the outlines of a plan of general union and co-operation between the two nations in their generalpursuit of a thorough reform of parliament,They which was unanimously agreed to. likewise had a committee to draw up rules for their internal government, and tickets forand they resolved, that this; 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12066 admission ; should be a standing law of this, and all future conventions, looking clearly in prospect, toa regular and constant establishment, and not to an accidental establishment, for a particular purpose. ‘Tisere are several other pro-ceedings which deserve your attention, but they are infinitely too numerous for me, now, to observe upon ; such as proposing a general fast, and a variety of other procecdings, which clearly shew, that they considered themselves as an assembly of a very different description from that of delegates of the several societies, met simply for the purpose of petitioning parliament fora reform in parliament. They received contributions; patriotic gifts and donations; they adopted, in all their proceedings those expressions which had been used in the French Convention; they talked of their own assembly, as the House; of taking the sense of the House; and several other things must have occurred to you, in the course of their proceedings, if you looked at them, or 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12067 “In Norwich there are , 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12068 attended to them, when they were read, by which you must be convinced, they had in view an establishment, upon principles ver different from those on which a meeting a delegates of societies, for the purpose of ob-taining a reform in parliament, ought to have been formed. You likewise recollect the pains they tok to enlighten the Highlanders of Scotland. It is impossible not to consider the terms they used for this purpose as an incitemcat, directly, to the Highlanders to arm themselres. You recollect the circumstance of a picture of a Highlander, armed with his broad sed and target ; and there are other circumstuce of the same tendency, which are not now ix mediately and distinctly inmy memory. There is also this resolution : “ That it be recommended to the different societies throughout the country, to copy the Bill of Rights into their minute books, as the ground of their proceedings, in order to prevent improper constructions upun their conduct, a friends to reform. This recommenistis sccins to me to be precisely upon that princt ple of deception which I have before nouced. There could be no purpose whatever, for which this resolution was to be inserted m their minute books, but to deceive—to hold out a peaceable and quiet reformation, whilst they meant the reverse. If they really 3 proved of the Bill of Rights, had it not beea universally derided in the books of whxb they had testified the strongest approbation, — in a work, in which it was called a bill of wrongs, and treated with the utmost disregard and contempt? But it served extremely wel for the purpose; not only to cover the proceedings of the different societies, but to mislead those societies, and to tell them, that the Bill of Rights authorized the a sembling a couvention of the people. peuple in the different counties were told that the Bill of Rights was the foundation all their proceedings, andthat therefore theyshould insert it in all their books; and whenthey were told, that it was lawful to assemblea convention of the people, they were ledto believe, that the Bill of Rights madeit lw ful for them to do so. These circumstances tend to show the means by which the poot cople, who were engaged with them, bare Beets led and deceived, like that unfortusate man who was examined, Hill. He told yoo that he had nothing in view but the constr tion of the House of Commons, as it was 2 the year 1688; there being, in effect, no al. teration after that time, except the 7 act, and some other acts, which tended rather to the benefit of the people, than to their 2 jury, in any way whatever. Lo. Then comes their famous resolutions f assembling a Convention of Emergency, & which a blank was left in the minutes, which they came to, on the 28th of Nose ber, I798
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12069 I wish to know, how the le counsel for the prisoner, whom I do not w see in court—I wish he was here—I mean, my learned friend who addressed you last, with great force, with great energy, and certainly with a considerable degree of ability— how he reconciles these resolutions, so left in blank upon the minutes, with the principle upon which he stated this convention to have acted.—He did not, indeed, distinctly state this convention to have acted upon it; he rather suggested the principle, and then endeavoured to slur the matter over, to pass it Ly, asserting, that, whatever might ve imputed to this convention, it could not affect that which was to have been assembled, and the prisoner had nothing to do with it. Gentlemen, you will recollect the solemnity with which the transactions relative to these resolutions were carried on; that, “ After an excellent discussion of the question, pertinent remarks and amendments, the convention was resumed, and the whole, as amended, heing read over, the members stood upon their feet, and passed the resolutions, unanimously, as follows."—Y ou will recollect, likewise, that this was preceded, in the course of the debate, by citizen Brown's siving a history of the Habeas Corpus Act, and therefore appearing to take an important part in the discussion of the question, Mr. Matthew Campbell Brown, who was the delegate trom Sheffield, and who has been stated as the Editor of the Patriot—There is a blank in the minutes, for these resolutions; and then the minutes import, that, “ After the said resolution, agreed to, and solemnly approved of, as above, citizen Gerrald, in an energetic and animated specch, addressed the meeting, and expressed his happiness at the motion passed, and exposed the act of the Irish parliament, called a Convention Bill; and citizen Brown followed him, in a manly speech, and proved the influence of the executive government over the parliament ;—and then, Citizen Margarut read and proposed a motion :--hat a Secret Committee of three, with the secretary, be appointed to determine the Place where such Convention of Emergency shall meet; that such place shall remain a secret with them, and with the secretary of this convention; and that each delegate shall, at the breaking up of the present session, be entrusted with a sealed letter, containing the name of the place of mecting; that this letter shall be delivered, unopencd, to his constituents, the receipt of which shall be acknowledged by a letter to the secretary, preferved in the same state, until the period shall arrive, at which it shall be deemed necessary jor the delegates to set off. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12070 Vhese resolutions, and a declaration accomPanying them, for which a blank was left in the minutes, and which were not to be inserted till after the end of their proceedings, Were in the fullowing words: “ Resolved, that the following declarations and resolutions be serted at the end of our minutes : “ That us convention, considering the calamitous consequences of any act of the legislature, which may tend to deprive the whole, or any part of the people, of their undoubted right to meet, either by themselves, or by delegation, to discuss any matter relative to their common interest, whether of a public or private nature, and holding the same to be totally inconsis‘ent with the first principles and safety of society, and also subversive of our known and acknowledged Constitutional Liberties, do hereby declare, before God and the World Si —which, you recollect, is the solemn manner in which an oath is taken, in Scotland, by persons ofa particular description—“ that we shall follow the wholesome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which shall militate against the constitution of our country, and shall continue to assemble and consider of the best means by which we can accomplish a real representation of the people, and annual election, until compelled to desist by superior force. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12071 Gentlemen, what is this but a declaration, that they would resist force by force; that they would resist, unquestionably, inferior force; and that it should be superior force only that should compel them to desist : « And we do resolve, that the first notice given for the introduction of a Convention Bill or any bill of a similar tendency to that passed in Ireland, in the last session of their parliament, or any bill for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12072 So that now they would have been in actual rebellion, as the bill for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act did pass ; —“ or the act for preventing wrongous imprisonment, and against undue delays in trials, in North Britain; or in case of an invasion, or the admission of any Salen troops whatsoever, into Great Britain or Ireland; all, or any of these calamitous circumstances, shall be a signal to the several delegates to repair to such place as the Secret Committee of this convention shall appoint. Throughout all their proceedings you find a Secret Committee. There is no one of the proceedings of any of these societies which you have had before you, in which you have not found a Secret Committec; that is, a few persons, who keep secret from the rest all the important proceedings, and guide and direct the whole. The formation of a Secret Committee being, necessarily, the formation of a thing which they conceive would not bear the open light of day, and particularly would not bear the eye of the existing government of the country, bound to keep and support the peace of the country,; “ and the first seven members shall have power to declare the sittings permanent, and twentyone shall constitute a convention, and proceed to business. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12073 What is this but a declaration, that, if they were compelled by superior force, to discontinue their meetings at Edinburgh, where they were then sitting, they would not, therefore, cease to be aconvention of the people, but that they would repair immediately to such place as the Secret Committee should appoint; that the first seven members, who should meet at such place, should have power to declare the sitting permanent, should constitute a convention immediately, and the moment they amuunted to twenty-one, they should proceed to business? If they had been compelled by superior force, by the authority and power of the government of the country, to desist from their meeting at Edinburgh and had assembled themselves again, in another part of the country, what could that assembly meet for, but for the purpose of evading the effect of that superior force, which miglit have dispersed them at Edinburgh, and of acting in that place, at which they should afterwards assemble with more effect, because supported with that degree of force which they might conceive sufficient to protect them against the existing constituted government of the country. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12074 They likewise resolved,—“ That each delegate, immediately on his return home, do convene his constituents, and explain to them the necessity of electing a delegate or delegates ;" which I conceive must necessarily mean something like the constitution of the French National Assembly, who have persons to fill immediately, without any delay, the seats which become vacant; “ and of establishing a fund, without delay, against any of these emergencies, for his or their expense, and that they do instruct the said delegate or delegates, to hold themselves ready to depart at one hour’s warning
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12075 Then they resolved, which shows clearly what they meant by the other part of the resolution, “ That the moment of any illegal dispersion of the present convention, shall be considered as asummons to the delegates to repair to the place of meeting, appointed for the Convention of Emergency, by the Secret Committee, and that the Secret Committee be instructed to proceed, without delay, to fix the place of meeting. So that, without delay, this Secret Committee were immediately to proceed to fix upon some place, at which this assembly of people were to meet, if they should be dispersed by the superior power of government; and at which place, therefore, they were necessarily to meet, in opposition to the existing government of the country. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12076 Now, gentlemen, this was communicated most completely to Mr. Hardy, by a letter, written to him by Mr. Margarot, on the 11th of December, 1793; and Margarot expressly states, that the convention had declured itself permanent ; by which he must have meant, that the effect of this declaration was, as it obviously was, to make the convention a perTanent assembly, the declaration of permanency being one of the most important parts of the proceedings of the French National Convention, at the same time it declared itself a National Convention. The means which it took for the purpose, being that of destroying, at least in the opinion of the people, all authoritative collection of revenue, whenever the assembly should be dispersed, and authorizing the collection, so long only as the a sembly should continue sitting. And gentle. men, you will recollect, in the history of you own country, the same sort of permanency, under the authority of an act o' parliamea, was the means by which the parliament, 0 the reign of Charles ist, finally destroyed the authority of that monarch. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12077 This letter of Margarot to Hardy has like wise a direct reference to the appointrent a the sitting of this convention, by the Secret Committee, in some other place, in case thes should be dispersed. It states, that the qovention had declared itself permanent; by which it must have adverted to this resolutza, which you will see is, in effect, a declaratsa of permanency; and it likewise says, te are to sit in some other part of the country, not yet declared, in case of their i which must refer (I am quoting only fon memory, for I have not the letter in my hand) ‘to that part of the resolutions, by which it was made of the instructions b the Secret Committee, without delay, to irs place at which the convention should mee, in case of its dispersion, or under other circum stances, in which they thought it proper tha the Convention of Emergency should meet. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12078 Gentlemen, I beg pardon for stating thi letter. Iam told, that, by some accident, has not been given in evidence, therefore you will lay that quite out of your consideraton You will recollect, however, that, in pursuance of these resolutions, the convention actualy did refuse to disperse, until compelled by 2 superior force; and this is proved by 2 letter of Margarot, in which he states, that Gemald and himself were pulled out of the chai; and upon the cross-examination of Ross by Mr. Erskine, the same fact was stated; 9 that they not only came to the resolution, bat they really acted upon it, to a certain degree. But the other parts ‘of these resolutions when considered with reference to the whol, have very extraordinary consequences; you will observe that this convention was meet as a Convention of Emergency, at2 cret place, to be appointed by a Secret mittee, not only in case of its being compe! to desist from its proceedings, sitting at burgh, by superior force, but also in sm other cases; particularly, as soon as ay 0 tice should be given for the introduction of convention bill. As soon as any meaxlt should appear to be taken by the governmest of the country for the purpose o on their meeting, which they should might be likely to have effect, they were assemble in that secret place to be appot! by the committee of emergency, remos themselves from Edinburgh, in which a they might not think they should be 9 to resist the powers of ae non as Le more distant place. ‘This they extend0 a the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act to the admission of foreign troops ; a report having been very industriously circulated of an intention to bring overa great number of foreign troops into this country. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12079 But they declare also, that this convention shall meet as a Convention of Emergency in another event; that is, in case of invasion. Iam sure I recollect the letter having been read which informed Hardy of the secret resolutions, because I recollect that the words “in case of an invasion are omitted in that letter. But Margarot states in that letter that the convention has done that which he does not think it safe to communicate by letter: “ The convention proceed with great spirit ; we sit daily; and last week we came to aresolution which we fancy will give pleasure to every friend to reform. As the minutes are to be printed, we will at present only give you the heads of it; viz—That should any attempt be made by government for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus bill, the introduction of a convention bill, or the landing of foreign troops in Great Britain or Ireland, the delegates are immediately to assemble in convention at a certain place (the appointment of which is left with a secret committee) ; that when seven delegates shall be thus assembled they shall declare themselves permanent, and when their number amounts to twenty-one they shall proceed to business. Thus, you sec, we are providing against what may happen. This is a letter written to Mr. Hardy himself.“ Thus you see, we are providing against what may happen. Then the letter proceeds to state— “ Letters convey but very imperfectly, and with no great degree of safety, what we might wish to inform each other of. And ina subsequent letter of the 8th of Deccmber, 1793, you will find he says—“ Not daring any onger to trust tu the post, we send you all these papers in a parcel ; what papers these were does not appear. “ You will be so good as to make us acquainted with their sate arrival. Gerrald wishes to get to London as S00n as possible; he will communicate that " which cannot so fully be expressed by letter. You may consider this as a private letter ; but you may read such parts of it as you think Proper to any member of the society, especially where it may be productive of good. Then here are resolutions come to which they are afraid to enter on the minutes of their proceedings ; which they are afraid to communicate entire in their correspondence between each other; which they Icave, therefore, to be communicated by word of mouth by one of the parties present: and even the very letter, thus cautiously written, is written to Mr. Hardy as aa private letter, of which he might communicate such parts as he might think proper to any member of the society, leaving to him the selection of the matter, and the parts he might so communicate;perhaps, according to the degree of fervor in the public cause he might conceive a particular member to have, and the particular confidence he might have in the discretion of that member; and this is to be especially where it may be productive of good ; showing most clearly by this that the prisoner was the active means by which the whole of this conspiracy was to be carricd on; the person with whom Margarot (who was then acting as agent of the society at Edinburgh) was to correspond, in whose discretion he was wholly to confide, and who was to communicate to the other members such partsonly of this correspondence—mutilated as it is, from the fear of danger that may attend acommunication hy letter —to communicate such parts of it only as he thought proper. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12080 Gentlemen, I stated that it was my intention to advert to that part of the minutes which followed the blank where these resolutions ought to have been entered, if they had been entered according to the daily and the ordinary course of their proceedings. After stating the solemn manner in which these resolutions were passed—the very solemnity with which they were passed showing the importance which those persons attached to them, and the omission of the word invasion in the communication still more strongly showing the importance which they attached to that particular word—“ Citizen Margarot read and proposed the following motion— “that a secret committee of three with the secretary be appointed to determine the place where such convention of emergency shalk meet ; that such place shall remuin a secret with them and with the secretary of this convention ; and that each delegate shall, at the breaking up of the present session, be entrusted witb a sealed letter containing the name of the place of meeting—that this letter shall be delivered unopened to his constituents, the receipt of which shall be acknowledged by a letter to the secretary—preserved in the same state until the period shall arrive at which it shall be deemed necessary for the delegates to set off. So that the place of meeting of this convention was not only to be determined upon by a secret committee of three (a very small number), but they also resolved that it should remain secret with them and the secretary; and that at the breaking up of the then present session (if during the session it should be necessary to make use of this cominittee of emergency at a secret place) each member should carry with him, ina sealed letter, the name of the place of meeting; that this should be delivered unopened to his constituents; that the receipt should be acknowledged by a letter to the secretary; and that the scaled letter should remain in the same state till the period should arrive at which it should be deemed necessary for the delegates to set off. So it was not to be known to any one member of the society, except the secret committee and their secretary, where that place was to be. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12081 Now, gentlemen, bave such proceedings as these the least semblance of a design to petition parliament only for the purpose of parliamentary reform? It is utterly absurd to give any credit to stich a suggestion. And, gentlemen, you will likewise recollect that my learned friend, Mr. Gibbs, admitted, that if you could not give his construction to their proceedings, you must necessarily give the construction which we put upon them —that if you could not take the colour he gave you; if you could not persuade yourselves that the only object of this meeting was quictly and peaceably to prepare petitions to the parliament, praying that that reform in the election of representatives might be carried into execution which they pretended they had proposed upon the wild plan, as I venture to call it, of the duke of Richmond, or any other specific plan they might think proper to adopt ; if the object of their mecting was any thing beyond that, it was impossible for him to justify it, though he should not admit it to receive all the attributes which we have givenit. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12082 The minutes of this day’s sitting refer toa proceeding which, I think, distinctly had in view that which afterwards appears in other parts of the proceedings—the supporting a convention by force. It is idle to say that a convention of this kind could have any effect whatever unless supported by force; and therefore it is not necessary to show you that any proceedings had taken place for the purpose; for when it is of necessity that in order to carry the thing into execution it should be supported by force, it is not necessary to show you that proceedings had been had for the purpose of creating that force. If persons orm a plan (such as was fabricated for the bishop of Rochester, and several persons of high rank) to bring in the Pretender—If that had been a real paper signed with the names of those persons who it was supposed had signed it (it turned out to be a wicked contrivance of two villanous men); but if it had been a real paper, it would have been an act of high treason, though they had procured:no force. But the moment they put their hands to that paper, which demonstrated their intention to conspire to overturn the government of the country ; demonstrating that intention by an overt act, namely, the puting their hands to that paper; the crime of high treason was complete, though they could not possibly have carried it into eftect but by raising an armed force, and notwithstanding they had taken no steps to raising that armed force. But here you have several traits of the tendency of this society to raise an armed force, even in the proceedings of this convention. They resolved —“ that a fund should be raised by subscription for defraying the expense of small patriotic publications to be distributed in the Highlands; that every publication should bear the figure of a Michldad-cyn in full dress, with target and broad sword to attract the attention of Highland-men: no publication to cost more than half a penns For what purpose could such publicat.. possibly be distributed, but to excite m. people m the Highlands to armthemselye' —What has the figure of a Highlander in iu dress, with target and broad sword, to do wi: a quiet, peaceable petition to reform pani ment? It has no connexion with it in te world. It has a clear connexion with acx vention which was intended to be suppene. by force of arms; but has no possible couzeion whatever with that which my lease friend says was the object of this conveutx. namely, simply and only petitioning pow ment. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12083 They propose, also, to appoint a commie of observation in London, for the purpox observing what was done there. What pox. upon that occasion? Margarot says—“ th: there was no occasion for a committee of tt: nature in London, as there were several the sand people in that city upon the look. It was accordingly agreed, that the comm tee should request the London commitet correspondence to give the earliest inteigence of what passed in parliament. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12084 Gentlemen, you will recollect that wu committee so referred to, was the Secret (ca mittee of the London Corresponding Socie's: which Secret Committee was by this 1e lution converted into a committee of obser tion for the British Convention, for the pz pose of giving information of every tit which should pass in parliament, sod London, upon this subject. That clea shows the connexion and dependence of ta very convention upon the London Core ponding Society, in the hands of its leades: videlicct, the Secret Committee, and those directed that Secret Committeewhich shes that the whole was really, and in effect, operation of those societies in London; a that the proceedings at Edinburgh were proceedings of persons who were only al: as the puppets of those in London. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12085 You will recollect the manner in which th Highlanders were to be enlighteas’—ty representations to them of their situs aggravated and false in the highest dese You will likewise recollect, that throught the proceedings of this convention they1" attempting to establish, by motions, te" tions, and soon, every thing that was oet sary to be established for the purpox convention actually meeting as a convents of the people, upon the principles upon “ we have proved they intended to act they were preparing to publish the nalun unalienable, and imprescriptible rights of and that a committee was appointed for that purpuse. To show that application to parliament was not within the considerativa of" of those who were at least the leading m bers in this business, or indeed the 930 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12086 of the members of the convention, a nouol for drawing out a scroil of a petition 0 parler ment was read on the of Novembes 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12087 1798, the tenth day’s sitting, and the order of the day was moved upon it. Now this isa meeting which my learned friends would attempt to persuade you was solely for the purpose of petitioning parliament, and one of the first things they do is, to move the order of the day upon a motion for petitioning parTiament. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12088 You recollect, eiilenets the manner in which they treated distinctions of rank in the case of lurd Daer—in the use of the word gentleman—the insipidity of the term gentleman, and the propriety of the term citizen— and a thousand other circumstances, which abow throughout the principles which the members of this convention meant to adopt, to carry into effect as far as they could You will recollect what Mr. Skirving said in the course of the proceedings. Upon a motion that was made he insisted “ that it was prpce on all occasions to take the opinion of the primary societies, and he considered the convention as only a committee of the people. So that Mr. Skirving, in the very Proceedings of this conventiun, was acting upon the grand principles of all those rights of man—that every form of government to be established among them was to be considered only as a committee of the people, and that the sense of the people was to be taken upon all acea-ions. Principles which the French Rational assemblies have constantly found it impossible to carry into execution; and you Toust particularly recollect that they refused to carry them into execution upon the most important subject which could come before them, namely, the death of their king. For when some of the leading members—some of the must enlightened—probably with a view of saving the king, wished to refer the consideration of tha' question to the primary assemblies in different parts of the country, it was negatived, on the ground of the impussi Ddility of carrving it into real and effectual axectition ; and because, if it could have been earried effectually into. execution, it must have tended w destroy the Convention itself. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12089 Gentlemen, you will recollect likewise, in the course of the debate which took place upon what they termed the unprecedented infringement of the liberty of the press, and the arbitrary sentence of judge Wilson against Mr. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12090 ; Holt. Mr. Justice Wilson being a man whom all those who are of the same profession must revember with deep regret and concern, and must acknowledge that he was one of the worthiestand the most upright men that ever graced the bench. gentlemen, in taking notice of these things, which they consider as abuses, Mr. Margarot observes— “It is unnecessary to attempt to lop off the branches while we are endeavouring to: and there is a blank, Endeavouring to what? How can you fill up that blank 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12091 “ It is unNecessary to ettempt to lop off the branches while we are. endeavouring to cut down the tree. You cannot fill up the blank in any other way. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12092 Gentlemen, I might go through the whole of the minutes of the proceedinys of this convention ; there are several other passages which equally meritattention; and it is evident that throughout the whole of their proceedings they contemplated the idea of acting by force of their own authority, supported by the force of so many of the people at large as they could prevail upon to sustain their measures ; that they looked to the attainment of their objects by those means; and probably also by the assistance of that foreign power which the two societies in London, the Constitutional Society, and the London Corresponding Society, had, in the latter end of the year 1792, clearly invoked—by means, probably, of the assistance of that power, for you cannot give any other interpretation to the words,“ In the case of an invasion. They clearly looked to the atainment of their ends cither by their own force alone, or by that force assisted by such foreign force. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12093 This convention being dispersed by the superior force of the constituted government, after that resistance which the members of the convention thought proper to give, and. which necessarily was only a formal resiatance, because they had not prepared measures for any more effectual resistance—what .was done 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12094 A meeting upon this was held, and a. variety of proccedings took place, in London, all tending to assemble another convention, expressly declaring, that in consequence of the dispersion of the British Conventivn,. they were determined to assemble another. For the proceedings had not arrived at that ripeness which could enable them to carry intoexecution, the plan of that convention of emergency, which they had suggested in the minutes of the convention in Scotland, because that could not have been completely carried into effect with respect to England, unless they had had a greater proportion of delegates from England, than they actually had. Finding that impracticable, they turned their minds to the assembling another British Conventionin England, and they openly avowed their intention of assembling that convention in England. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12095 Gentlemen, the first proceedings which seem to have been directly taken for that purpose were the resolutions of the Constitutional Society, on the 17th of January 1794; but previous to that time a letter was written by the prisoner, on the 10th of January, to Mr. Adams, the Secretary of the Constitutional Society, merely informing him of the anniversary dinner ef the London Corresponding Society, intended on the 20th of January, 1794. I meation that circumstance, because it drew both the Societies together in the transactions of that day. There was no reason for giving the Constitutional Society any notice of that anniversary dinner, unless for the purpose of enabling them to attend it if they thought proper. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12096 Gentlemen, I should have reminded you, that in the mean time Mr. Margarot had communicated to Mr. Hardy the circumstances which had passed at the dispersion of the British Convention, and had excited him by all means to take some spirited resolves upon the subject—Mr. Hardy in his answer to Margarot, continued to represent that the society would act as Margarot desired them to do; and he writes to the secretary of the society at Norwich, this letter, on the 11th of January, 1794.—Fellow Citizen. I have just received a letter from citizen Margarot, at Edinburgh, with some of the Edinburgh Gazetteers, (you observe this is a day after the letter he wrote to Adams, informing him of the anniversary dinner, of the 20th of January) “where you will see that citizen Skirving is found guilty, and sentenced for fourteen years transportation to Botany Bay. Margarot’s trial comes on next. He meets it with great firmness and resolution. I have No time to make comments on the proceedings; but I think our opponents are cutting their own throats as fast as they can. Now is the time for us to do something worthy of men. Why was it the time for them to do something worthy of men 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12097 “ The brave defenders of liberty, South of the English Channel, are performing wonders: driving their enemies before them, like chaff before the whirlwind. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12098 What was in the mind of Mr. Hardy when he wrote that letter? What could be in his mind, but that persuasion which we see generally diffused throughout all their proceedings, that the success of the French republic, was intimately connected with the success of their own schemes; that they were all embarked in one common cause—that their hope and reliance was not upon a majority of the people of this country—for I think even the report of the committce of constitution shows, that they had no hope of obtaining that majority, but that they did hope they should obtain so large a party, that, with the success of the French republic, they should be able finally to accomplish their object—at least they thought that that was the time to strike. ‘ Now is the time for us tu do something worthy of men—the brave defenders of liberty South of the English Channel, are performing wonders; driving their enemies before them, like chaff before the whirlwind. The letter proceeds, “ The London Corresponding Society is to have a general meeting, and an anniversa y dinner, on Monday the 20th instant, at the Glohe-lavern, Strand. Adverting, you see, in this very letter to that intended meeting, on the 20th of January; a meeting upon which my learned friends have not dared to say one single word—adverting to that meeting, as the time when it might reasonably be supposed, that something would be donc in consequence of what was mentioned in the former part of this letter. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12099 There is one passage in this letter, trifling as it may appear, which I cannot avoid observing upon; because it is a pi which, give me leave to say, a little contradicts that character which has been given of the prsoner, “I have sent you some of Marzarot'’s and Skirving’s indictment, with two copies of a pamphlet on an am the author is a member of our society—I y may putitin practice. It will be a great saving to many families—also a diminution of the revenue—for every one brewing their own beer, pay no duty for it. So that, you see, the prisoner had in his contemplation, a dimimtion of the revenue of the country, as an object which he thought proper to recommend te the person to whum he wrote at Norwich; uot simply for the purpose of saving money to families, but as it would affect the revenue of the country, and therefore, as he conceived affect those persons whom he considered his enemies, the constituted government of the country. It is a trifling circumstance, but trifling circumstances like these, which are the natural overflowing of a man’s mind, show the temper of that mind more than what he writes when he is under some degree of restraint. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12100 Gentlemen, I shall next notice to you, some resolutions of the Society for Consutetional Information, on the 17th of January, 1794, upon which, as I recollect, no observation has been made by either of the learned counsel, and which no member of the Consttutional Society has been called to explain. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12101 “ Resolved, that law ceases to be an object of obedience, whenever it becomes an instrument of oppression. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12102 “Resolved, that we recall to mind with the deepest satisfaction, the merited fate of the infamous Jefferies, once lord chief justice of England, who at the era of the glorious revolution, for the many iniquitous sentences which he had passed, was torn to pieces, by a brave and injured pcople. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12103 “ Resolved, that those who imitate his example, deserve his fate. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12104 Gentlemen, when these resolutions are considered with reference to that which follows, what is the meaning of them, bat an incitement to the people of Scotland (for you see it has reference to those cases in Scotland) to follow the example of the persons who are represented as having torm to pieces the infmous Jefferies ? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12105 “ Resolved, that the Tweed, though it may divide countries, ought not, and does not, make a separation between those principles of common sccurity, in which Englishmen, and Scutchmen, are equally interested ; that in justice in Scotland, is injustice in England; and that the safety of Englishmen is endan gered whenever their brethren of Scotland, or a conduct which entitles them to the approbation of all wise, and the support of all brave men, are sentenced to Botany Bay; 3 punishment hitherto inflicted only on felons, 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12106 Here they resolve, that the conduct of those f you approve of it, you ee ace ear ne i A 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12107 MeocRr a rR ATH ER 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12108 a em eo eTealgted in Scotland, was not only not blameaJe, but a conduct which entitled them to the approbation of all wise and the support of all brave men. The epithet, brave, is pretty striking. A peaccable and constitutional supof a man, does not require much bravery; ut a support by force, may require bravery, when therefore the approbation of all wise, and the support of all brave men, is called for, one may easily guess what it is that the per- , sons who enter into those resolutions mean.They add, 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12109 “ Resolved, that we see with regret, but see without fear, that the period is fast approaching, when the liberties of Britons mustdepend, not upon reason, to which they have long appealed, nor on their powers of expressing it, but on their firm, and undaunted resolution to oppuse tyranny, by the same meansby which it is exercised. What is that but an explicit declaration, that the time was fast approaching, when they conceived, that it! would be necessary to exert force? Whetheraccording to their ideas, force had hecomeMecessary or not, you cannot determine. It never can be an object of determination for a jury, or for any court of justice, whether the subjects of a government, are entitled tu rise in rebellion against that government, in connence of any conduct of that government. It 1s a question, which whenever it does arise, can be decided only by the sword. It never can come into discussion in a court of justice. Therefore, if the conduct of the government of the country has been ever so oppressive, a court of justice cannot permit itself to discuss, whether that occasion has arisen, which amounts to the dissulution of all government, and when therefore it can itself have no authority to act—This resolution follows. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12110 “ Resolved, that we approve of the conduct of the British Convention, who though assailled by force, have not been answered by argument, and who, unlike the members of a certain assembly, have no interest distinct from the common body of the people. Aresolution, which not only adopts all the proceedings of that convention, and all their conduct but particularly and distinctly adopts that part of their conduct, in which they declared themselves a Convention of the People, and declared that they meant by that declaration, that they were representatives of the common body of the people. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12111 The last resolution is, “‘ That a copy of the above resolutions be transmitted to citizen William Skirving, secretary to the British Convention, who is now imprisoned, under colour of law, in the Tolbvoth of Edinburgh. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12112 Gentlemen, this led to the proceedings of the 20th of January, 1794, at the Globe tavern, and these proceedings are extremely strong— a recollect that these proceedings appear to we been wholly a concerted business; that they were nothing like the acts of the persons who met there, but that they were proceedings previously determined upon, Mr. Thelwall, seems to have had ‘a principal hand in Preparing the account of the proceedings, which was printed and distributed; and he detivered it to Davidson the printer, to be printed on the 18th of January—Gentlemen, this account of the proceedings, begins thus, “ Ata general mecting of the London Corresponding Society heldatthe Globe tavern, in the Strand, on Monday, the 20th day of January, 1794,citizen John Martin in the chair—The following address to the people of Great Britain, 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12113 ‘and Ireland, was read and agreed to. So that you see, gentlemen, they are detcrmined to prucced with a sort of caution, which had not been observed in the proceedings of the Convention at Edinburgh, in preparing the minds of the people by a previous address for the meeting of an assembly, which should assume the character of a convention of the people. This you will recollect was an idea which clearly had occurred to some persons who were concerned in the conspiracy, particularly to Mr. Yorke; and which he communicated in conversations which have been stated to you in evidence. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12114 This address, speaking of the abuses which are supposed to exist in the British government, and speaking of the laws of the country says—“ We ure every day told, by those persons who are interested in aupperting the corruption list, and an innumerable host of sinecure placemen, that the constitution of England is the perfection of human wisdom ; that our laws (we should rather say, their laws) are the pertection of justice ;—and then they proceed to speak of the administration of the country—They then state a number of proceedings which they think proper to find fault with—The convention bill in feland—the proceedings in Scotland—and they add—“ In Scotland, the wicked hand of power has been impudently exerted, without even the wretched formality of an act of parliament,—having before adverted to the act of parliament which had been passed in Ireland “ magistrates have forcibly intruded into the peaceful and lawful meetings of freemen, and, by force (not only without Taw, but against law) have, under colour of magisterial office interrupted their deliberations, and prevented their association;—A declaration that they conceived the dispersion of that Convention at Edinburgh was an illegal act—Then they add— «The wisdom and good conduct of the British Convention at Edinburgh, has been such as to defy their bitterest enemies to name the law which they have broken; notwithstanding which, their papers have been seized, and made use of as evidence against them; and many virtuous .and meritorious individuals have been, as cruelly as unjustly, tor theit virtuous actions, disgraced and destroyed, by infamous and illegal sentences of transportation ; and these unjust and wicked judgments have been executed with a rancour and malignity never before known in this land. Our respectable and beloved fellow citizens have been cast fettered into dungeons, amongst felons, in the hulks to which they were not sentenced. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12115 Gentlemen, what are those virtwous acts of this British Convention
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12116 When we read their proceedings, is not the whole of their conduct a tissue of conspiracy—of sedition— of treason and rebellion against the government of the country ?—And yet these ave the actions which the London Corresponding Society think proper to call virtuous actions— which the Society for Constitutional Information describes as that which entitled them to the approbation of all wise, and the support of all brave men.—Persons who so declare themselves with respect to the proceedings of such an assembly as the British Convention assembicd at Edinburgh, declare themselves adverse to all government; not only to the existing government, but, it seems to me, to government. If individuals may s0 act with impunity, it is impossible for any government to exist. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12117 They then proceed—“ Citizens, we all approve the sentiments, and are daily repeating the words, for which our respectable and valuable brethren are thus unjustly suffering. We, too, associate, in order to obtain a fair, free, and full representation of the ple.—Where? In the House of Commons
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12118 No—“ in a house of real national representatives :""—Here is an express declaration, that they do not mean a reform in the House of Commons: it isa declaration, that they associate in order to obtain a fuir, free, and Sull representation of the people in a house of real nutional representatives.—Why do they declare this now ?—Why ! because they find that now was the time or never, as Mr. Hardy expressed it in his letter, for them to do something worthy of men, when the French were driving their enemies before them, like chaff before the whirlwind.—They proceed—“ Are we also willing to be treated as felons, for claiming this, our inherent right, which we are determined never to forego, but with our lives, and which none but thieves and traitors ean wish to withhold from us?—Gentlemen, these inherent rights they declare, in their committce of constitution, to be, the right of every citizen, not only to a share in the egislatice, but in the executive government of the country. That right could only be exercised by the creation of a representative gowernment; and here they declare, they “ as-ociate in order to obtain a fair, free, and full Tepresentation of the people, in a house of real national representatives ; and ‘ that th 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12119 ‘ considered that as their inherent right, which they were determined never to forego, but with their lives. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12120 Gentlemen, this is the clearest and the most decisive declaration of the intentions of: these men, when combined with all that is before stated, and may explain any thing which is ambiguous in it, if amy thing is ambiguous. Atreally appears to me, that there is nothing 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12121 (eve ambiguous in this paper, What is it butde claring, that they hed associated—that is, that they had conspired—in order to obtain far free and full representation of the people, ms house of real national representatives, and ia auch a house only; and that they claimed ts as an inherent right, which they were determined never to forego, bat with the hamwd of their lives. When they say, they are de termined zever to forego that nght, but with their lives, it amounts to the same thiag a5 eaying, that they were determined to ascert 2, at the hazard of their lives—Gentemen, what construction can be pat upon ths paper, but that it is the most direct incite ment that can Pesby be conceived, all the members of their society, t0 ase sorce— and indeed to all the persons to whom this letter was addressed—the people of Grest Britain and Ireland? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12122 They proceed—“Can you beliewe, that those who sent virtuous Inshmen and Scotchmen, fettered with felons, to Botany Bay, de not meditate, and will not attempt, to seue the first moment to send us after them; er, if we had not just cause to apprehend de same inhuman treatment—if, instead of the most imminent danger, we were in perfet safety from it, should we not disdain to es} any liberty or privilege whatever, in wha our honest Irish and Scoteb brethren did mg ally and as fully participate with wa Their cause, then, and our’s, is the same; and it is both our dety and our interest stand or fall together. The Irish parkammest, and the Scotch jndges, actuated by the same English influence, have brought us derectty a the point. There is no farther step beyond that which they have taken. We are at issue —What ts the meaning of these words,Wr 4BE aT Issue? We are come to the point in which we must repel force by fosce— There can be no other meaning given to these words—“ We must now chuvse at enee, either liberty or slavery, for ourselves and ew posterity.—Will you wait til barracks me erected in every village, and till subsidined Hessians and Hanoverians are upon us
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12123  In the very moment that they slander the government of the country by those expres sions, they clearly declare their meaning— They assert that the government of the coentry has in contemplatien to oppress them by force, and that the government of the coun try having formed that intention to oppress them by force, they are determined also te use force—“ There 1s no farther step beyond that which they have taken—VW are at 1s8un? We must now choose at once, either hiberty or slavery, for ourselves and our posterity."— And they declare that they would not wait till the government should take more efiectual steps for the of restraining them. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12124 They add, “ You may ask, perhaps, dy what pea shall we ron nee sae ne wi rve, men, same Io re-echoed bac, fm different words, ima ve viety of publications, originating all from that Siess ofthe 6th of Aigutt, 1792, and which shows, that the leading men in these proceedings had the same thing in view, at least from that period
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12125 “ You may ask, perhaps, by what means shall we seck redress ? We answer, that men in a state of civilized society, ere bound to seek redress of their grievances from the laws, as long as any redress can be obtained by the laws; but our common masaes, whom we serve (whose law is a law of liberty, and whose service is perfect freedom) has taught us not to expect to gather grapes from thorns, nor figs from thistles — We MUST HAVE REDRESS FROM OUR OWN Laws, aD NOT FROM THE LAWS OF OUR PLUNDERERS, ENEMIES, AND OPPRESSORS. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12126 Translate this into plain words, conveying a plain meaning—What is it but this—You ak by what means shall we seek redress
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12127 We answer, that men in a state of civilized society, are bound to seek redress for griew ances by law, as long as any redress can be obtained by law; but, when all laws are violated, then that compact by which civilized society is kept together, is dissolved, and we bave a right to act for ourselves—That is the char interpretation of the first part—They add, “ But how can we expect to gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles.— What do they mean by thorns and thistles? Why the king and the parliament—They assert that they could not expect any redress from them, or at least from the parliament, because they could not expect to gather grapes from thorns, nor figs from thistles.—“ We must have redress, therefore, they say, from our own laws, and not from the laws of our plunderers, enemies, and oppressors. — What does this mean, but that they must have redress from a Convention of the People; for this is an address to the people.— “ We, therefore, must mean “ the people. and “ our own laws, must mean “ the luws of the people.’—We, the people, must have redress from our own laws, and not from the jaws of our plunderers, enemies, and opPressors—characterizing, by thuse terms, the constituted authorities of the country.—And they add, “ There is no redress for a nation circumstanced as we are, but in a fuir, free, and full representation of the people. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12128 Gentlemen, these are declarations clear and plain. My learned friend called upon 4as to show clear and plain declarations. Can any thing be more clear and more plain? dere is no caution used—they had now determined to lay aside all caution—and you will observe, that my learned friends did not attempt to say one single word in explanation of any part of this transaction
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12129 The fair, the free, and full representation of the people, which they describe, has been so over and over again explained, in their own publicaions, and in their resolutions and addresses ; in the report of their committee of constitution, and elsewhere; that it is utterly unne cessary for me to go over that ground agai but merely to observe, that, by a fair, os and full representation of the people, they clearly and unquestionably mean, on all occasions, a perfect representation of the people, as they sometimes ble it; namely, a representation of the people, in an assembly which should act as a National Convention, like the National Convention of France, by means of which, every citizen should have the right of sharing in the government of the country, legislative and executive.—Then. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12130 here, gentlemen, they have clearly an openly declared their resolution to have such a convention of the people, and to create a ll upon the principles of the Rights of an. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12131 Now, gentlemen, if a man had proclaimed, in this country, the pretender, and there! declared his intention to establish upon the throne of this country, that family which has been driven from it, instead of that which hag since been placed upon the thrune, nu man would have entertained the slightest doubt, that the mere act of proclaiming the pretender, would have been treason; and my learned friends will recollect, that, in the course of the trial of Mr. Layer, the very case is supposed by the counsel for the crown. They say, in answer to an objection with respect to evidence, “ Suppose a man should have proclaimed the pretender, and then have gone away, and the proclairation could not found, what would be the effect of that? Could not you give, in evidence, the contents of that proclamation?’—‘ Yes, says Mr. Hungerford, the counsel for the prisoner, and who was no way a friend to that government, “ the very act of doing that, would be, in itself, an overt act of high treason. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12132 Then, if proclaiming the pretender is an overt act of high treason, is there any difference betwcen proclaiming the pretender, and proclaiming a republican government? And this is a proclamation for a republican government
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12133 I do nut mean to say, that alll the consequences were immediately to fullow ; that the king of the country was tu be considered, as from that moment, depused.— This appears to be rather a proclamation that there shall be such a government; not that it shall instantly take place, but that it shade be established, and that they will take steps for the purpuse.—And you will remember, that, in the case of treason, a plan once formed, und steps taken in pursuance of it, is sufficient tu constitute treason; and it is not necessary that the steps should be effectual for the purpose. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12134 Then they come to the following resolution: 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12135 “ Resolved, That during the ensuing session of parliament, the general cumnuttee of this society do meet daily, for the purpese of watching the proceedings of the p:rlament, and of ‘the administration of the government of this country. —This, and the following resolution, they borrow from the British Convention, whose proceedings they had approved, droping only that part of the resulution of the British Convention which they thought it not sate to introduce into their minutes ; namely, that part respecting an invasion — “ Resulved, That, upon the first introduction of any bill, or motion, inimical to the liberties of the people; such as landing foreign troops in Great Britain or Ireland, for suspending the Habeas Corpus Act, for proclaiming martial law, or for preventing the people from mecting in Societies for Constitutional Information; or any other innovation of a similar nature. hut, on any of these emergencies —words which leave an openitg fur almost any thing—That, on any of these emergencies, the general committee shall issue summonses to the delegates of each division, and also to the secretaries of the different societies athliated and corresponding with this society, furthwith to call a general convention of the people, to be held at such place, and in such manner, as shall be specified in the summons for the purpose of taking such measures into their consideration. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12136 Gentlemen, you will recollect, that just at this time the society for Constitutional Information (who were always acting in their way in support of the measures first adopted by the London Corresponding Society) thought roper to clect Barrere, St. Andre, and Rodist, honorary members of their society; declaring, that they considered those mer as “ the most enlightened friends of Freedom— “ judicious, I think, they likewise call them. Gentlemen, the mere election of these persons to be members of their society is, in some degree, adopting their principles; but when in the very act of election they declare that they so elect them because of their principles, when men elect a person into a situation because they consider him as one of the most judicious and enlightencd friends of Freedom—when upon a political subject, they declare they consider the principles of that man to be those of a judicious and enlightened man; they really transfer all declared and avowed principles from the person so elected to their own society, and make them in effect the principles of their own socicty. You will recollect, they follow this up afterwards hy the publishing to the world their resolution for insertion of the speeches of Barrere and St. Andre upon the subject of the execution of the king of France in their minutes; and then you will particularly recollect the manner in which Barrere in his spcech describes a National Convention. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12137 Upon the first question, “ whether the person of the king is invivlable, he describes that which seems to me to be very important to recall to your attention, aithough the attorney general remarked upon it very considerably in the observations which he made upon it. Barrere says, that— The people of Paris, by making an holy insurrection against the king on the 10th of August, deprived bim of his character of inviolability; the people of the other departments applauded this insar. rection, and adupted the consequence of it; the people have therefore formally interposed ty destroy this royal inviolability ; the tacit consent of the peuple rendered the person of the king inviolable; the act of insurrection wasa tacit repeal of that consent, and was foundedor the same grounds of law as the consent itself, The king’s person is inviolable ouly with relation to the other branches of the legis ture, but not with relation to the people. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12138 Calling the attention of the public to these speeches, which is equal to publishing then, shows the intent with which these were proceeding; and that when they had as sembled a general convention of the people, supposing that convention to be approved of by the other parts of the country, they would have considered the people as having tormaly interposed their power to destroy the royal inviolability. For the assembling a conven tion of the people, acting as such, and supported by the power of the people, must of Necessity have been an insurrection of the ople against the existing government; and if the people in general, according to the system of Barrere had applauded this tmsurrectioa, and adopted the consequence of it, the people would have formally interposed to destroy the royal inviolability, and all the consequences which are stated in this speech of Barrere must have followed. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12139 The speech proceeds to discuss whether an appeal should ie made to the people, and be says---‘The people are the Suvereign. A convention is a perfect representation of the sovereign; the members of the legislative assembly acted in August upon these pnncples in summoning the Convention ; They declare that they saw but one measure which could save France, namely, to have recourse to the supreme will of the people, and to mvite the people to exercise immediately that unalienable right of Sovereiznty which the constitution had acknowledged, and which it could not subject to any restriction. then be says—‘ The public interest required that tae people should manifest their will by the election of a National Convention, formed of representatives invested by the people with unl mited powers; the people did manifest their will by the election of that Convention; the Convention being assembled is itself that sovereign will which ought to prevail; it would be contrary to every principle to suppose that the Convention is not exclusively the expression of the general yill. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12140 These societies, then, having declared that, under certaincircumstances, there should forte with be called a general convention of the people; and having, at the same time, adverted to the principles so laid down by Barrere, as the principles of a man whom they th: ta judicious and enlightened friend of fi m, they must have considered a convention of the aS people as an assembly of the nature stated in this speech of Barrere, and upon which I have before so much observed. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12141 Afterwards at a meeting of the committee on the 23d of January, it was resolved, that the toasts drank at the anniversary dinner of the society should be printed at the end of the address. These toasts testify their approbation of “ the British Convention at Edinburgh 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12142 —of “ Skirving, charged by the sentence of the Court of Justiciary with the honour of being the cause of calling that convention — of “the London Corresponding Society, and the several other societies’ and then of “ their condemned delegates. Then there is the following toast—“ Success to the arms of freedom against whomsoever directed, and confusion to despots with whomsoever allied. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12143 These words, though they do admit of another interpretation, yet are in themselves general ; and, considering the complexion of the whole of this transaction, they apply most directly to that which was the object of the meeting, 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12144 Ramely, the establishment, by force, of a convention of the people, for the purpose of effecting, as they conceived, their own freedom; a measure to which, it is perfectly clear, under certain circumstances, they meant to have recourse. There is another toast which has a degree of ridicule in it, but you will see clearly what was meant. Mr. Barlow had said in his letter to the French Convention, that it had been completely shown that a king 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12145 On the 27th of March the prisoner wrote 2letter to the Constitutional Society, in which he stated—“I am directed by the London Corresponding Society to transmit the following resolutions to the Society for Constitutional Information, and to request the senti-ments of that society respecting the important. measures which the present juncture of affairs seems to require. The London Corresponding Society conceives that the moment is arrived when a full and explicit declaration is necessary from all the friends of freedom. Therefore this letter of the prisoner declares, that that moment was arrived which is alluded to in the preceding resolutions of the 20th of January ; and then he adds—“ the Society for Constitutional Information is therefore required to determine whether or no they will be ready when called upon to act in conjunction with this and other societies to obtain afair representation of the people; whether they concur with us in seeing the necessity of & speedy convention, for the purpose of obtaining, in a constitutional and legal manner, a redress of those grievances under which we at present labour, and which can only be effectually removed by a full and fair representation of the peuple of Great Britain. The London Corresponding Society cannot but remind their friends, that the present crisis demands all the prudence, unanimity, and vigour that ever may or can be exerted by: men and Britons; nor do they doubt but that manly firmness and consistency will finally, was fred for nothing. One of their toasts is— “allthat is good in every constitution, and may we never be superstitious enough to reverence in any that which is good for nothing. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12146 Now the wor 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12147 Is superstitious enough to reverence in any that which is good for nothing, carry the allusion so directly to that letter of Barlow, and the works of Paine, in which the respect of the people of this country for monarchy has been treated as a superstitious reverence, that it is impossible to doubt what these persons meant when they gave that toast. And here I may observe, that in many of the State Trials you will find that toasts drank at meetings of persons engaged in such transactions faye always been Considered as important evidence of the minds of the persons so met; because, such: toasts are given for the express purpose of animatin the persons assembled to the acts in view and they believe shortly, terminate in the full accomplishment of all their wishes. Gentlemen, here is a tull declaration in this letter, written by the prisoner atthe bar, that he looked forward to the actual accomplishment of all his wishes. What those wishes were has been already fully and sufficiently declared. They were—to establish in this country a representative government, founded upon the broad basis of the rights of man—the annihilation of monarchy—the annihilation of what he calls aristocracy—the annihilation of all ranks and distinctions of men, and giving equal active citizenship, and an equal right to every individual in the government or his country, legislative and executive—in fine, the complete establishment of a whole

They likewise showed the manner imwhich they meant to redress. these grievances which they here state; wher in their prior resolutions of the 20th of. January they said—that they could not exfect redress from any existing authority— that they considered themselves as persons whe, though they had been in a state of ivilized society, were now authorized to consider that association. as at an end, no. redress could be obtained by the law; andtherefore, that they must have: redress from l their own laws, and not from the laws of their lerers, enemies, and oppressors..

And here is another instance of that secrecy which we find throughout every measure, and which most clearly demonstrates that their intentions were not honest. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12158 Gentlemen, this circular letter produced answers. Some of them have been read to you. The Norwich letter, which is dated the 29th of April, says, “ it is with great satisfaction we view the manly conduct of you and your eollesgas especially when surrounded, as you are, by adomineering aristocracy, who, hotwithstanding their great bluster, are but chicken-hearted. It concludes, ‘ we should be glad to know whether the friends of the people consent to a convention, and whether they will take an active part. A letter dated the 11th of May, 1794, was sent from the Sheffield Societies, which states a meeting in the open air at Halifax, in order to consider measures Preparatory to a general convention. This letter says, “ they were advised by us to defer at present the meeting of delegates until farther information, which should come from you (meaning the prisoner) “ on that subject. So that the thing was continually proceeding ; for this is dated the 11th of May, and you will recollect that upon the 12th this unfortunate man was arrested. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12159 There is a letter written by the prisoner on the 1st of May, 1794, which clearly and directly states the ideas he had formed upon what were to be the consequences of the measures they were about to adopt. It is in answerto a letter from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, on the 24th of April, 1794, which says, “ Being charmed with your masterly and bold approbation of the conduct of your delcgates, and noble martyrs for truth, Margarot and Gerrald, and finding your name signed as secretary to the Corresponding Society, we wish to copy your example, and beg, if you think us worth your notice, you will give us your views and intentions as soon as convenient, which I hope will be a means to stimulate and increase our numbers. They had heard nothing of the convention, because this society was just formed. They conclude witha—“ Farewell, hoping the hydra of tyrann and imposition shall soon fall under the guillotine of truth and reason. To this the prisoner, on the ist of May, writes this answer— “It is with pleasure the London Corresponding Society hear that a society on a similar plan, and with the same patriotic objects in view, is likely to be established at Newcastleupon-Tyne. If ever a ctisis arrived that required the exertions of the people, to stop the current of corruption, infamy, and despotism that seems likely to overwhelm them, it is the present. In God's name then let us use the exertions—we are called upon by every thing that is dear to us as men, and as Christians. The cause of truth and liberty must rally be omnipotent, therefore doubt not at the glorious reign of liberty and equality will ere Tong be established, and modern governments, with every appendage of wickedness and corruption, will flee in time from their genial influence, as beasts of prey to their dens of rapine and darkness from the rising sun. Certainly alluding to that which has been in their minds from the moment of that address of the Society for Constitutional Information to the National Convention of France, in which they represent what has passed in America as a faint light, but that a great and brilliant light was to burst forth upon man. That sun of reason which was ta arise and illumine the whole world, was to come from the East—from France—betore the genial influence of which, modern governments, with every appendage of wickedness and corruption, should flee. There is no possibility of doubting that in this letter the prisoner has viciwals adopted the proceedings then going forward. He adds, “ the London Corresponding Society have beheld, with indignation, the rapid advances of despotism in Britain, aud are ready cordially to unite with every other society in the three kingdom: who have for their object a full and effect representation of the people. They therefore have deputed six of their members to meet six members of the Society for Constitutional Information, to form a.Committee of Correspondence and co-operation. ‘This committee Meets regularly twice a week at No. 2, Beaufort Buildings, Strand,’—which you recollect was the place where Thelwall’s lectures were delivered“ where any member delegated by your society will meet with every information required. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12160 You see, therefore, that the prisoner himself states on the istof May, 1794, not that nothing was doing, but on the contrary, that the Committce of Comes ndence and Co-operation, by means of which the whole measure was to be effected, were regularly meeting twice a week in Beaufort Buildings, where any member delegated by this Newcastle Society would meet with every information required. The letter concludes thus—“‘ We inclose you a few of our resolutions, entered into at our general meeting on the 14th of April, which will be sufficiently explanatory of our sentiments and views. We heartily unite with you in wishing that the hydra of tyranny and imposition may soon fallunder the guillotine of truth and reason—repeating the words which had been used by their correspondent. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12161 Gentlemen, intervening transactions had taken place; namely, the proceedings at 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12162 Chalk Farm on the 14th of April, and the proceedings at Sheffield on the 7th of April. You will recollect that the meeting at Chalk Farm was originally intended to have been on the 7th of April, and from this letter it apfears that general meetings at the same time were intended to have been had throughout the whole country. The proceedings at Sheffield, of which we have a very particniar acy count, seems to me to show the whole intent and object of all these men. The person who acted principally there was a Mr. Yorke, whofh you have seen before in the character of delegate trom the Society for Constitutional Information to the convention assembled in Edinburgh, but who never went to that meeting. I believe ill health was the occasion, or perhaps that disapprobation of their measures which he stated in conversation, and of which evidence has heen given. At this meeting at Sheffield Mr. Yorke comments first of all upon a variety of measures, and upon the nature of the government of the country, which were, ax he pppoe, the subjectsin the contemplation of all the persons assembled upon that occasion. These proceedings seem to have been prepared before-hand, and to have been given immediately in the form of a printed paper. He then adverts to that which is adverted'to in the proceedings of the Socicty‘for Constitutional Information, and in those of the Corresponding Society ; the supposed idea of introducing a mercenary army into the country for the purpose of preventing the meeting of the people in convention. He says— It is doing too much honour to innocent subjects to be alarmed ata few pages of writings or ata few fugitive orations, when barracks are erected in a country, and sixty thousand armed mercenaries are ready to execute the mandates of government ; he then states, “ the day is at length arrived when fanaticism and superstition, deprived of their tinsel trappings, and exposed in their native ugliness to the views of mankind, slink scow]ing back to the cave of obscurity. There I hope they will for ever remain. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12163 The use of this language, almost similar to that used in the letter of Hardy which I have before noted to you, shows the general correspondence and communication between those parties, and the manner in which they borrowed, one from the other, the expressions which they made use of. The fanaticism and superstition to which he alludes, are the fanaticism and superstition which include the prejudices which men generally have in favour of the established government of their country. He adds, “ The energy of Englishmen will no ionger endure this strange uproar of injustice. The paper states, that “ the people then came to these resolutions, which resolutions were not heard by, and not knownto, far the greater part of the persons there assembled, and they are stated to have heen adopted with the exception of one or two persons present— “ First, that the people, being the true and only source of government, the freedom of speaking and writing upon any subject cannot be denied to the members of a free government, without offering the it insult to the majesty of the people. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12164 Second, that therefore the condenmatson ofcitizens Muir, Palmer, Skirving, and Gerrald to transportation for exposing the corruptions of the British Government, wx an act better suited to the remains of a despotic than a free government. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12165 “ Third, that the address which has now been read, be presented to the king in behalf of the above persecuted patri dress you: will find at the beginning of the Printed proceedings, and it is one of the 2iGrosses to the king contained im those pe ceedings. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12166 s — next: raoved, that a petition be presented to the House of Commons for a reform in the representation ef the people is a aap but so marked was the disapprotion given by the whole meeting to this measure, that not one single person secended the motion, buta most profound silence, interrupted only by a few murmurs, was observed. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12167 Gentlemen, you will recollect that it is m evidence before you that the motion for a petition to be presented to the House of Com mons was alla contrivance; that it was nos intended that the propriety of presenting any such petition should be seriously bat that it should be brought forward by a persca in concert with this Henry Yorke, merely for the purpose of being rejected. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12168 “Upon which Henry Yorke again arose and addressed the meeting in an aninzated speech of an hour long, and of which it is impossible for us to give our readers a just conception. He took a general view of the British Consttution, and stated its most prominent defects, among which the wantef a perfect national representation was the most glaring. He dwelt a considerable time upon this subject, and then proceeded farther to comment upos it’? He then said, “ It was now high tme that the people should lay aside leaders, ciscard factions, and act for themselves. That the people should lay aside: leaders, discar¢ factions, and act for themselves! In tne first place, when the London Corresponding Society had prepared a petition to the House of Commons, they had applied to Mr. For t present that petition; Mr. Fox told them, “ As the request of my constituents unquestionably I will present this petition; but I tell yor: be fore hand that I totally disapprove of what you propose, universal suffrage annaal per ieneniss ap therefore, I wish you would apply to some other person to present your petition. They must, therefore, have ins pertectly rie at on any petition which they might think proper to present to parliament igen the only grounds on which they stated they would be content (for they mever bars confined themselves within a smaller cosmpes suffrage and angus than requiring universal parliaments) they should be opposed by one of the most able men in this country, and a man who, for a great number of years, has constantly acted in opposition to the king’s ministers. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12169 They then applied to Mr. Francis, who has been examined upon this trial—Mr. Francis says, he told them, explicitly, at the time that they desired him to present their petition, that he likewise disapproved of the prayer of their petition, and that he likewise should Gree it to the utmost of his power. Genlemen, you will recollect, that they cuncealed from Mr. Francis the purpose for which this petition was to be presented. He “was not aware, that they had no serious intention in presenting this petition, and that their object was only to raise discussion and discontent ; that was, in no degree, represented to him, nor were there stated to him a variety of other circumstances respecting the transaction. They likewise knew, that the Society of the Friends of the People would listen to no such measure. The Corresponding Society had artfully enough continued to keep up correspondence with the Society of the Friends of the People, after that society had discarded the society for Constitutional Information, because they saw that the Society for Constitutional Intormation was going to those great lengths, which the Friends of the People Hieatptevest They knew, therefore, that all those persons, who not only were notin the habit of supporting government, but, on the contrary, were in opposition to it; when I say, in support of, and in opposition to government, I mean in support of the administration of the government, and, in opposition to that administration; they knew -that all those persons would oppose that very plan of reform, which those societies meant to introduce. ‘They knew, therefore, that they could not hope to do any thing in pardiament, and that a petition to the House of Commons must necessarily be nugatory, because all parties agreed in thinking, that the plan which they -proposed was inadmissible, and yet they had expressly declared, that they would be content-with nothing less. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12170 Mr. Yorke, therefore, told the people at Sheffield, “1t was now high time that the ste should lay aside leaders, and discard ns, and act for themselves. He strongly enforced these principles, and then entered into a complete detail of the ancient consti‘tution, as established by Alfred, which he proved to be at this-time totally defaced, if Dot lost. He then pursued the gradual decline of popular liberty in England, from the -anarchy which was the consequence of Danish 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12171 Norman invasion, and taking a general -sketch of our history, so far as it was connected withthe subject of popular representation; he made some strong and pointed remarks on the revolution in 1688
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12172 He said, that the revolution, at least so far as it recompromise between the king and the aristocracy, for the jeint inheritance of the peoples but to establish, on unequivocal Sa les, the right of the people, to govern themselves, end to recall those delegated powers which they had entrusted to their servants for this purpose, ‘when they were either abused, or neglected to exercise them. If the revolu-tion were not a revolution for the people, it was no revolution at all, but a conspiracy of a few-ennobled oppressors, against the liberties and happiness of the many.—But, if it were designed ‘to comprehend the whole, and its end has been perverted, or purposely laid aside, the people are not warranted in petitioning, but are justified in demanding, us a right, 3 ly to the tone of language used in the declaration of rights, the restitution ofannual parliaments, and the establishment of universal suffrage. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12173 Then, gentlemen, he proceeds, in an extremely long speech, to observe upon the effects of that universal emancipation to which he looked; saying, that “ oppressed nature will, at a proper season, depart from passive principles; and should an attempt be made to wrest what remains of liberty from us, I trust all men will concur to vindicate their violated rights ; and he concluded with saying, “ When such a revolution of sentiment shall have dispersed the mists of prejudice ; when, by the incessant thunderings from the press, the meanest cottager: of our country shall be enlightened, and the sux of reason, of which we have heard so much, “ shall shine, in its fullest meridian, over us, then, THE COMMANDING VOICE OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE SHALL RECOMMEND THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTYEIGHTGENTLEMEN IN‘SAINT STEPHEN'S CHAPEL, TO CO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS. Then several resolutions were entered into, one of which was : Convinced of this truth, it is the apinion of this mest that the people ought to demand, asa right, and not petition, as a Savour, for universal representation. —« That, therefore, we will petition the House of Commons no more on this. subject. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12174 It has been attempted to represent this, as meaning, that they would petition the House no more, in the character of separate societies, or individuals; but the resolution is explicit, and clearly shows, that that was not what they meant ;. for, they say, ‘ Convinced of this truth, it is the opinion of this meeting, that the people ought to demand, asa right, and not petition, as a favour, for universal representation: that THEREFORE we will petition the House of Commons no more on this subject. The reason given for petitioning no more, would apply just as much to petitioning, in the form of a number of persons, assembled by delegation, at Edinburgh, or elsewhere, as it would to this meeting at Sheffield
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12175 Then, as a sort of colour of their proceedings, and as the means of exciting discontent, a long petition was prepared for the abolition of the slave trade. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12176 Gentlemen, they speak then of the rejecAion of their petition by the House of Comgnons; and they say, “ Our petition was received with the utmost indignation, by the House of Commons, which was no more than wwe expected ; and, “ although our petition was disdainiully rejected, because not couched in language suthciently polite and respecttul for the tive hundred and fifty-eight gentlemen, whu sit in the House of Commons, yet, believe us, fellow citizens, we are still of opinion, that the matter it contained was not only just and proper, but we think that even the languaye, which gave so much offence to the hon. gentlemen, was much too polite and too muderate for us. For, if the House of Commons were the real representatives of the people, we certainly had a right to dictate and not to petition. You will find, throughout the whole of this transaction, that they had Now assumed, that they had a right to dictate, end not to petition
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12177 And you cannot form the slightest reason to believe, that a petition to the House of Commons was within their view. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12178 They conclude : “ But our petition being the country ; and therefore holding principles rfectly inconsistent with the present esty flishment of the British government. Gentlemen, there are many other passages which might be observed upon, but I a afraid I have already infinitely too Jong tres passed upon your patience. There is ow subject upon which I have hitherto seid bu little; I mean the subject of arming. I could wish, also, if I had strength for the pi ealng to say something to you upon the subject of Chalk-farm ; but I am realty unable to doa. With respect to the subject of arming, asit assedat Sheffield, what does it show? That, some means, the minds of the people st Sheffield, T mean of the people who belonged to these societies, were impressed with idea, that some civil commotion was to beer pected, and that it was, therefore, necessary for them to provide themselves with arms for their defence; and I will take it, that thos witnesses who have appeared here, spoke perfectly seriously when they said they meant these arms only for their own defence. Bat the purpose of Yorke, Davison, and Gale, who are the only three persons who appear scouted, we shall trouble them no more with our coarse and unmannerly language; it -will be our duty to proceed, as we have uniformly done hitherto, in enlightening the public mind, and when a complete revolution of sentiment shall take place (as will shortly be the case) in our country, we shall open our mouths in that key we think most agreeable 0 ourselves ; and our voice, together with that of our disfranchised countrymen, will resemble, perhaps, the thunderings from Mount Sinai. Clearly alluding to the idea, that the opinion of the people, supporting a convention, assembled and acting as a convention of the peuple, speaking, therefore, under that character, the public will, as described in Barrere’s specch, would be irresistible; and that its thunderings would be in that key which the Persons who composed it should think most agrecable to themselves, and would resemble the thunderings of Mount Sinai. Then they speak of their principles, and say, “ These essential principles are both easy and comprehensive. On these we build our right to representation, and renvunce the idcu of future petitions. So that they cleatly renounce the idea of future petitions, not simply from themselzcs, but from any other persons, assuming their title to universal representation, as a right, and Not as a thing to be obtaincd by petition : By these maxims we find that every Englishman is free, and that in the clection of a Supreme magistrate, or in the delegation of leBislatiwe powers, he concedes his actions to a certain superintendence, for the express purse of preventing liberty from vaulting over its imits, ‘und introducing a system of universal Niolence, injury, or licentiousness ;—applyin Election to the supreme magistrate, as wall Bs to every other part of the government of have been active persons upon the occasion, was as completely answered, whether nt had armed those men for the purpose of defence, or any other purpose whatever. They had armed them with a weapon, cheaply and easily obtained, and easily used; they very well, likewise, that which appeared upoa the examination, I think, of one of the wit nesses for the defendant, that ten thousand such arms might, at Sheffield, be fabricated in a day; so that it was unnecessary that the actual fabrication of arms should be immediately thought of. Nothing more was wanting than to put the people in a train, for the pupose of obtaining arms when they should be wanted, The ie thingnny al y with res; to what passed in 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12179 As to Tee letter from Davison, itis Drogo clear, although we cannot trace the fact, thst it had been communicated by the prisoner, a some way or other ; otherwise Edwards sev could have known, that the prisoner was tle person to apply to, for a direction where get arms at Sheffield. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12180 Gentlemen, ata much earlier period, the persons concerned in this transaction, looked upon what was going forward, as leading to extreme anarchy—I allude more particularly to the letter of Skirving, of the 5th of July, 1793, to the prisoner at the ba, a which he clearly and explicitly states, whst his ideas upon the subject were. In wnitiag that letter of the 5th of July, 1793, Mr. Skix ving had it in his contemplation that, by pr sibility, in a very short time, the whole cou try might be in anarchy and confusion. Be says—“ If we sought only the extirpaix of one set of interested men from the 1 ment of national affairs, that place mightgiven to another set, without affecting Uvitals adverse to the system of reform, bet might be easily aceomplished; but to cut up deep and wide rooted prejudices, to give effectual energy to the dictates of truth, in favour of public virtue and national prosperity, in opposition to self, and all its interested habits, and to withstand, and overawe the final efforts of the powers of darkness, is the work of the whole, and not of a part; a work to which maokind, till this awful period, were never adequate, because never till now disposed to fraternize ; not merely or only, I trust, from the sense of the common danger to which we are exposed, but from the ennobling principle of universat benevolence. I think the minds of all must, in the nature of thin turned to more effectual means of reform— not one person was convinced of the necessity of it by the most convincing arguments of reason, together, with the most uneqnivocal expressions of universal desire. hat then is to be hoped for from repetition? I am only afraid that the bow in England, against refornt, was so contracted, that in returning it may break. You would willingly learn, you say, from us; I own that we ought to be forward in this. We have at once in great wisdom perfected our plan of organization, and it we were in the same independent state of mind as the people of England, we should be able to take the lead. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12181 He proceeds to observe upon the consequences of that plan of organization, which he says has been established, and the object of which was, to effect the reforms which he had proposed. He adds—“ The associations with you are no more, I fear—excuse my freedom —than an aristocracy for the good of the people. They are indeed moderate, firm, and virtuous; and better cannot be: but we are the people themselves, and we are the first to show that the people can both judge and reSolve, if undirected by faction, with both wisdom and moderation. I have not a higher wish in the present exertions for reform, than to see the people universally and regularly associated, because I am persuaded that the present disastrous engagements will issue in ruin, and the people then must provide for themselves; and it would be unhappy, when we should be ready to act with unanimity, to beoccupied about organization, without which, however, anarchy must ensue. What can this advert to but a contemplation in the mind of Skirving, so early as the 25th of May, 1793, that things were approaching to such a state, in this country, that there would be a dissolution of the whole of the existing govern ment; and, if some other government was Not provided in its place, that anarchy must ensue? “ Let us, therefore, (says he) “ take the hint given us by our opposers. Let us begin in earnest to make up our minds relative to the extent of reform which we ought to seek, to’ be prepared to justify it, and to Controvert objections, Let us model the whole in the public mind. Let us provide avery stake and stay of the tabernacle which we would erect ; so that when the tabernacles of oppression, in the palaces of ambition, are broken down under the madness and folly of their supporters, we may then, without anarchy and all dangerous delay, erect at once our tabernacle of righteousness, and may the Lord himself be in it. e 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12182 Now, gentlemen, here is a man contem plating that which was likely to be the result of the measures in which he was en, vseeing they led to anarchy and confusion, and exhorting other persons to be prepareth for the event, by providing a plan for that new i government which he meant to establish, inbe now stead of the government which he meant to destroy. He then proceeds to describe what was the unfortunate state of the Roman government, after the nations which had been subjected by it, had been left “ like sheep without a shepherd clearly alluding to that state of anarchy wiich at that period prevail. ed in Europe; a state described in history so forcibly, and picturing so completely, in many instances, the present situation of France, that really when one reads that history, one almost imagines one is reading the history of the present state of France. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12183 The letter proceeds—“ We may suppose an event which we deprecate. Nay, should we not be prepared for every possible issue, at the present unprecedented divisions of mankind? we have a right to be apprehensive of the abilities ofour own managers, who are so afraid to depart from precedent, that like men of detail, they may be inadequate to the task of preserving the vessel from shipwreck, now grappling with danger, not only great, but new and uncommon. The letter adds—“ if the present ministry fail, who after them shall be trusted? It requires little penetration to see the anarchy and discord which will follow. It will be such, that nothing short of a general union among the people themselves, will be able to heal. Haste therefore to associate, at least to be ready to associate. If then such a broken state of things should take place, the civil broils that would necessarily ensue would soon subside, before the united irresistible voice of the whole. Do not, I intreat you, hesitate thinking such a work premature as yet; but 2 month, and then it may be too late. The sp pcensian upon this man’s mind, unquestionably, was extremely strong—an impression not at all, indeed, warranted by the event; his idea was, that the danger was then great —he looked to the gencral dissolution of government—he looked to anarchy and discord —he looked to civil broils as necessarily ¢nsuing; and the only hope he had, was in the united irresistible voice of the whole adopting some plan, to be actually formed, and ready to be offered to them upon the instant. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12184 Gentlemen, this letter clearly shows, that that sort of civil discord had been long in the contemplation of these parties. Whether they ever took those means to provide for the contingencies which might happen, which the writer of this letter recommends, it is impossible for us to know. All that I can observe is, that if you look into the report of the Committee of Constitution of the London Corresponding Society, I think you will find a sort of provision, not adapted merely to the purposes of a private society, but easily convertible to the purposes of a nation actin ynder the ideas which these societies had o} the proper manner of governing a country. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12185 Gentlemen, I will make one short remark m what passed at Chalk Farm, principally with a view to call to your attention the very violent resolutions which were intended to have been adopted at that meeting, by one of the parties—I likewise would call to your attention, that the system of arming appears to have been, in some degree, adopted throughout, as to what was said with respect to the knives it certainly was a trifling circumstance, but the fact is not contradicted, and I would particularly remark to you, that a pergon of the name of Pearce, was named specifically in the evidence of Groves (whose evidence is the only evidence that has been in any degree materially affected) as one of the peswns who were present at the transaction. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12186 might have appeared and contradicted -that assertion ; he has not appeared and contradicted that assertion, he therefore must be taken, from his silence upon this occasion, to have assented to the eth of that assertion. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12187 I would likewise observe, that Green, the man who in some respects contradicts Groves, was called on the pee of the crown; and I think that you will believe, that those who had the management of this business on the part of the crown, when they called that man, had no idea of concealing from you an’ circumstance of which they could obtain evidence for your information. He likewise himself, upon his cross-examination, admitted something which might give some sort of colour to the evidence of Groves—but. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12188 Gentlemen, put out of your consideration all the evidence that Groves has given—put out of your consideration these knives, and a thousand other little trifling circumstances— you will find all the parol evidence given, confirmed by the written papers—you will find not one word of that parol evidence contradicted, except so far as the evidence of Green, one of the witnesses on the part of the crown, contradicts the evidence of Groves, another witness on the part of the crown, in this single circumstance—at the same time that hundreds and hundreds of people might have contradicted the test part of tl 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12189 1 evidence which has been given, if it had en thought safe for the prisoner to bring those persons to the bar. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12190  You will likewise recollect the paper of the Ins and Outs, which was certainly an incitement to arm, exactly upon the same principle es that which was proceeded upon at Sheffield, ineiting the people to provide arms for self-defence—the persons who 36 inciaj them, having no reason whatever for incitiag them to arm, for any particular object, at thir moment, but simply for the purpose of pre viding with arms the persons whom they meant afterwards to make use of, and having the power to refrain from telling them the application which they meant to make df them, till the moment when it would be oo venient for them to do so. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12191 Gentlemen, I have addressed you beyood my strength
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12192 I feel myself unable to sv any thing more, though I am well indeed I well recollect, there are many things I meant to have stated, which I mre er, give your verdict, according the truth of the evidence laid before you. Sif that shoud enable you to give a verdict of acquittal, 1 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12193 at you will give it with jor. —If it should compel you to give a contuy verdict ; bitter though the cup may be, you may not passit from you. You have a solem duty to perform ; you must tax own feel. ings; you must perform it. I have had a dut which T have found not only difficult to but painful to my own fee nee T have et deavoured to discharge it faithfully. Having done so, I will now trouble you no longer. 
EYRE 12194 We are at the seventh day of this trial ; and it comes tom now to sum up this great and momentos cause. Is it expected or wished, on the pat of the prisoner particularly, , and also oa the part of the prosecutor, that the whole of ths written evidence should be repeated to be jury? or, would it be satisfactory to eve ly, that the parol evidence only should be summed up to the jury, that they should be left to their recollection of the written ev dence, together with the production of st parts of the written evidence, as, 0 course of the summing up, it may appet to me to be necessary to have recourse to If it is at all the wish of the prisoner in pert cular, or the counsel for the prisoner, orif is insisted upon on the part of the prosecutt, I shall not at all regret the expense of my time, or bodily fatigue, as far as it may be a cessary for me personally to go through it— would willingly spare the jury, if I could, cause their labour has been infinite; amd, I were to gu through the whole of the wn evidence, I am very apprehensive that should only load them with an imperfet collection of a mass of evidence, which, If! were stated again to them, they wouldatruth be less prepared to receive the at tions that I shall make upon those pets the evidence that appear tome tobei. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 12195 On the pest rosecution, it appears to me, that I cannot tter consult the interest of the public, than to leave the execution of this uty to that discretion which presides here. 
ERSKINE 12196 I shall net express my own sentiment, because the attorney general has expressed my sentiment completely
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12197 I leave it entirely to the discretion of your lordship; and Mr. Hardy desires me to state his confidence in the justice of the Court, and to express his acquiescence in the mode your lordship proposes. 
EYRE 12198 Then I will take that course
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12199 If, in summing ups there is any paper I should not state, which the counsel on either side, and particularly the counsel for the prisuner, should think may throw light on what I do state, if they will be ood as to put me in mind of it, as I goon, certainly be read.

EYRE 12210 The first witness that was called, after the written evidence was in a great measure gone through, was William Camage, who said, he was a member of the society at Sheffield; that he became so the latter end of the year 1791; that he acted as secretary, he believes, five or six months ; he ceased to act in that capacity about the latter end of April or May last—he used to sign the letters, which were often written by others—the business of the society was managed by different persons—there was acommittee—the leading persons of the committee were one David Martin, who used to attend the committee ; John Allcock, George Widdison and Matthew Lodwin—they were 
EYRE 12211 ‘sons concerned in writing these letters— thatthe professed object they had in view, was a parliamentar felon thee they chose Matthew Campbell Brown a delegate to the Scotch Convention, and that he was sent to Brown at Edinburgh, by the Society to carry him cash. He says, there was, at first, a parliamentary reform proposed to be brought about by petition to parliament. Being asked what was theirnext measure, supposing peed ieee was rejected, he said, he never heard any other specific plan, proposed by Mr. Yorke, or pointed out by him. He says, the society was threatened to be dispersed in their meetings, by the people of Sheffield, by the opposite party; that they thought it necessary that they should have arms for their own defence; and he approved of it; he did not see any harm in the business; but they had a right to be armed for their own defence, against any illegal attack from that party, and to protect their meetings; this, he said, was the gencral idea amongst a great many, whose names he could not mention at present, he says, Mr. Yorke approved the idea. He was shown the blade ofa pike ; he said, it was shown to Mr. Yorke by Henry Hill, who is here as a witness, who is a shoemaker's knife forger ; as well ashe recollects, it was Hill who made that blade of the pike ; 
EYRE 12212 arms, and nothing of arms in any other coz. try; he said, he did not know of any quanutr being made, excepting three dozen, whi: were made, he believes, by Hiil; he sx. he saw a pike handle at Widdison’s; : was about eight or nine o'clock at night, wie: he went to Yorke’s about it; that no pen: was pregent. 
EYRE 12213 He says, he was at the meeting upc tix Castle Hill, at Sheffield; that, at that tm:, there was no recommendation of arms. He says, he knew Davison, who was servantGale; and he also knew Robert Moody. Yorte recommended, that parliament should not be petitioned ; he heard of an addre-s to te people; he says, that Yorke was drawn hex in a carriage, without horses ; be heard Yor disapprove of the Scotch Convention ; fa k thought the people were very much uoprjared. P Hc proves a letter produced, to be «dk Davison’s hand, addressed to Hardy, and th: he had seen it m Davison’s possesswn s: Sheftield. Davison, he says, came origins from Leeds ; and he acted as secretary ? Lecds. Le says, he desired thata letter fm Hardy might be directed to Moody; and ix eaid, the proper secretary’s name, wich Broomhead, was struck out, because the thought some letters to the secretary had bee: intercepted. He said, Moody put handles three ten pikes; they were somewhert about seven feet long, made of fir ; the blak about ten inches ; they were about the sim shape as a bayonet, fluted and pointed ; ther were none shafted, that he knew of, of a0 other shape; one was mide betore, which was not of that shape ; and, as well as be re collects it, that one was shown to Yorke. He said, that Davison is gone off. He is asked to a night cat; he says, he knows what its: it stands four ways; the use of it he sys & to act against cavalry, by being thrown wl the strect

Upon his cross-examination, he sy 8 parliamentary reform was his object—s mot equal representation in the House of (om mons; he had no idea of any thing being a ditated against the king’s majesty, House of Lords ; there never was an iviitr dual of the society had any such thunght; they had no idea of carrying their reform a by force, or to overthrow the inclinations & the people at large, and the inclinabuns a parliament; he would not have contm : member, if there had been any idea of fore; if the object they had then in view, aight fortunately have affected the safety of honour of the sovereign upon the throot, would not have continued in that society. ie He said; he generally read the papers fore he signed Thai but not always; hart tinued to be a member after he ceased secretary, till the time he was taken UP; " saw no reason to suppose they im te mischief of this sort; they began 
EYRE 12215  threatened with interruptions in March, 1794; he never heard that the proposed convention was, to pnt down the king and the parliament, and to take upon themselves the functions of government; the Sheffield Society thought that the Scotch Convention would petition, and that the House of Commons would attend to the application of a large number when a small number of individuals might be neglected; that he should have thought himself the most abandoned of mankind, if he had continued a member of the society, if they had taken up such sentiments ; he said, he had never any reason to believe that there was an intent to destroy the constitution. He said, they were afraid of the opposite party making an attack upon them; they thought what they were doing was legal; they had no intention of arming against the king and parliament; he would not have remained another day in that society, if that had been the use intended to be le of these arms; but he thought they had a right to have arms for theit own defence, upon the Bill of Rights, against any of those people that might attack them: Yorke said it was so. He could not take upon himself to tell what the delegates of the convention meant to do. - He believes it was the cheaphess of the article that recommended the pikes. As to the cat, he did not know that any were made from the model ; he had seen some years ago, something of that kind at Neweastle; and, as he recollects, as to the time, it was some time about the American war; the letter alluded to in this man’s evidence, is addressed to “ Citizen Hardy, No. 9 Piccadilly, London. “ Fellow Citizen ; the barefaced aristocracy of the present administration has made it necessary that we should be prepared to act on the defensive, against any attack they may command their 1ewly-armed minions to make upon us. A pian has been hit upon, and if encouraged sufficiently, will, no doubt, have the effect, of furnishing a quantity of pikes to the patriots great enough to make them formidable, the blades are made of steel tempered and polished after an approved form ; they may be fixed into any shafts, but fir ones are recommended of the girt of the accompanying hoops at the top, and about an inch more at the bottom; the blades and hoops, more than which cannot be properly sent to any great distance, will be charged one shilling; money to be sent with the orders.

EYRE 12218 The witness ssys, Davison might have the same views for the people in London as the witness had in Sheffield; he says the pikes would cost about twenty pence. Being asked if he ever heard of such a place as the Parrot in Green Arbour Allev, London, he says he does not know any thing ofit. 
EYRE 12219 The next witness is William Broomhead, he is a cutler at Sheffield, and was a member of the Constitutional Society there at its first institution in 1791; he says he did not know that he was one of the twelve who were associated with the London Constitutional Society ; he has some idea of a letter having been written that they might act in conjunction, but never heard of the association ; he was secretary of the society in Sheffield for the last five months before he was apprehended, which was in April; he says the object of the society was a parliamentary reform, by meeting and endeavouring to enlighten each other, and to spread the knowledge of grievances, that they might unitedly apply in the most unexceptionable mode for a teform of parliament; the term universal suffrage he did not hear of till the Edinburgh Convention; he says he knows Yorke, w sometimes goes by anothcr name, by the name of Redhead, he resided at Sheffield several times ; he cannot tell exactly how long, the last time might be six, seven, or eight weeks. The witness knows Gale; he says Yorke used to attend the weekly mectings during his last visit at Sheffield, but he was not a settled inhabitant of the place ; that he was considered as a man of considerable abilities, and an orator, and treated with respect ; he said he wrote several pamphlets at Sheffield; he used to bring parts of them to be read to the society at these meetings. 
EYRE 12220 The society held these meetings in a small and in a large room; there was an elevation for the speaker, which some called the pulpit, some the tribune; from this tribune Mr. Yorke addressed the society. He was at the meeting upon the Castle-hill, Mr. Yorke was there, and expatiated very largely upon the corruptions which had crept into the constitution, or rather the evils complained of; he says his manner of speaking sometimes carried him farther than he ought, he was peculiarly energetic, fiery, very warm, very strong, but that he said nothing contrary to the law and constitution. 
EYRE 12221 He says it was settled ata previous meeting, that he the witness, should make a motion for a petition to the House of Commons, in order that it might be over-ruled, for the purpose of introducing another motion in its place ; he says he made his motion and it was objected to, with a view to the introducing another; he says there were four of them of the committee, himself and three more—that: several people were assembled ; the new motion was, to petition his majesty, it was drawn up before they assembled, for a reform in parliament; that Mr. Yorke addressed the people, that the petition was sent to London to earl Stanhope, but he did not think fit to] “ O Thou whose awful word can bind resentit; they afterwards agreed that Mr.| ‘“‘ The raging waves, the raging wind, orke’s specch should be printed; it was| “ Mad tyrants tame, break down the higt. printed and published at Sheflield; a printed} ‘ Whose haughty foreheads beat the sky; copy was shown to the witness, he believes . that which is now produced eae one; there Makcehare tine arm, great King of King, were some, he says, to be had at Mr. Gale’s an shop; he : says at their private meetings phat wonder-working arm whick broke

EYRE 12230 Resolved, that the comman:ling a general fast for the purpose of imploring the Divine Father of mercy and peace to support and prosper us in the horrid act of deliberately destroying our fellow-creatures, is repugnant tothe true spirit and principles of christianity, where we are commanded to pray for our enemies, &c. and farther considering that a great part of the people are unacquainted with the nature of the present war, either as to its justice or necessity, every endeavour being used to keep them ignorant of the real Principles and designs fur which it was commenced, to approach and to supplicate the Omniscient Power under such circumstances, and for such a purpose, must indeed be dreadful, since knowledge and conviction are wanting ; the worse than hypocritical hearts of those who are the authors of such a measure, although they at present impose upon the ignorant and credulous by such detestable, such pretended show of devotion, cannot escape the chastisement of that Power whom they thus insult, and from whose judgment there is no appeal.

EYRE 12233 “ Resolved, that the secretary of this society be directed to write to the Friends of Peace and Reform, at Sheffield, and to assure them, that this society views, with pleasure, their steady exertions to ubtain a fair representation of the people of Great Britain, in parliament, and the proper methods which they have taken to employ, usefully, those days which‘may be appointed for public fasts.

EYRE 12235 This publication, and the resolutions thus entered into, on the Fast-day, at Sheffield, received the approbation of both societies, the Constitutional, and also the London Corresponding Socicty 
EYRE 12236 William Broomhead goes on with his evidence : he says, that the society consists of about six hundred ; that they never amounted to many more; certainly not to two thousand, they had been represented to be of that number in some papers, which led to this explanation. The distribution inte divisions, or sections, was not regularly kept; that they were to meet as they thought proper; but that they were to cullect a penny a week each, to ake a fund; he says, that that part of the business was not properly attended to; the district mectings were nvt regularly and properly attended to
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12237 tle says, that a gentleman, from Halifax read the lec ture, and that the pamphlets were sold, but they had not a very extensive sale; the witness himself composed a prayer that was used upon the occasion; the copy was delivered to the printer, and it was settled, at a private meeting of some of the members, that it should be so printed. 
EYRE 12238 They next go to the proceedings at Sheffield, in the open air, on the seventh of April, 1794, which are also in print, and were tound upon the prisoner, which, I think, should be read to you
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12239 I have only to observe, at present, upon this paper, that, as to the general libellous turn of it, nothing very material to the present question ariscs, but that there is one passage in the petition, which may be very material for your consideration, where he talks of an impending storm, connecting that with the date, which is the seventh of Apri], 1794, it may be hereafter matter for your consideration. 
EYRE 12240 I thought it necessary that the whole of this paper should be read, because the paper has been very much relied upon in the cause, and because different constructions have been put upon it by the counsel in support of the prosecution, and by the counsel on the part of the prisoner: the importance of it is not drawn so much from its general extravagance, as it is from the particular circumstance that it purports to resulve, that the body that were then assembled at Sheffield, would petition parliament no more, and would try some other course; what was meant by petitioning parliament no more, and what was meant by trying some other course, will be a sulject for your deliberations when you take this paper, with all the circumstances that preceded it, and that followed it, keeping in your minds, that this is a paper which was published among a very numerous set of people, assembled at Shefheld, just about the time that the proposition for a convention of the people was under consideration, in a committee of correspondence and co-operation of the two societics, the Constitutional and Corresponding Societies, in London, and that this paper was found in the hands of Hardy, the prisoner at the bar, the secretary of one of these societies; at present, I make no farther observation upon this paper, only recommendin; 
EYRE 12241 to you, as far as you can, to keep the genera! import of it in your minds, that you may understand the application of it, when it comes to be examined hereafter, on both sides. 
EYRE 12242 The original examination of Broomhead was finished by reading these papers; he was then cross-examined; he said there was a hand-bill circulated for the purpose, as he supposed, of exciting the people against the society; it was a call to the people to arm against foreign and domestic enemies; that the adverse party to him, aud his friends, at Sheffield, had given out, that they should be able to do nothing with him, nor his party, the society, till they could cause a riot; that, from this, he understood, that arms came to be talked of; that it was to oppose illegal force, such as had been used at Birmingham, and at Manchester; such as was against the law of the land; he says, Gale had, in his hand, the hand-bill, at the time they were talking of arms; and there were several resolves printed, in his paper, the week following, being a direct answer to it, mentioning something upon the matter. 
EYRE 12243 Being asked, if any of the people in this society to which he belonged, bad any idea of making any attack upon the king, or the House of Lords, or had any idea of altering the government, in that respect; he says, it was as much his intention to fly to the sun; he says, his object was, to enlighten the people; to show them the ground of all their complaints and sufferings, when a person worked for twelve hours a day, and could not get a living ; that was what he understood of it; their object was parliamentary reform; as such they corresponded with the Society of the Friends of the People, as well as the Constitutional Society; he says, he would not have been a member of this society, if there had been any idea like that of attacking the King, or the House of Lords; he does not think there was such a wicked man among them; that parliamentary reform, in the House of Commons, was their object; that the idea was, that King, Lords, and Commons might, with the concurrence of the nation, make a reform; that no one, in Sheffield, doubted but that the object was, to attain this pereetys and that there was no intent, to is knowledge, to use any force. Then he added, what wicked people might have done, in that case, he could not answer for; he says, he would not have sent a man there, as a delegate, if he had supposed he would not have acted peaceably. 
EYRE 12244 When he was re-examined, he was asked as to one Ashton, who had been secretary to their society; he said, they might have sent, for aught he knew, to the Friends of the People, to say, that they would have no more to do with them; and it might have been discussed in their meeting, whether they would have any more to do with them, be cause they were not fit for their purpose. Gentlemen, you will find, in the course of the correspondence here, a letter, which bad been written by this society, after they had correr ponded with the Society the Friends of the People, written to the London Correspondi or Constitutional Society, in which they say, that they did not care to have any thin more to do with that society, the Friendsa the People, not thinking them honest, He says, he does not know of a resolutica being come to, to write that letter; it might have been after he was gone ; he says he took some part in the debate, and does not believe that they, the Society of the Friends of the People, were honest; that though they bed promised to use all constitutional means, they were not satisfied with them; this might be about the twenty-sixth of May, 1792. After the hand-bill had been published, he says they published a counter advertisement, asd they took the same words in their counter advertisement, as had been taken in thi hand-bill, and had it inserted in Gale's calling upon the people to arm against invaders, and domestic enemies. 
EYRE 12245 He was asked, as he says they had ben threatened, whether, before they armed, they had applied to any magistrate ; he says, na. He states that Gale and Yorke, two of the active members of this society, proposed these papers, and that the society winked at ther doing it; by which he meant to convey, that they were more violent than they should have been; that they winked at their doing it, a having a good opinion of them, says, that the resolution respecting landing of He sian troops, was passed long before this baad bill; he knows nothing of the intelligence that was sent at the time to the London Corresponding Society, by Davison, nor beard any thing of it, till he was informed of it at his examination before the privy covodl He says, he cannot answer for every body was in this society; there wight be wicked men among all bodies; that as to this Davison, if he sent the letter, it was without his knowledge. There were then read tions of the date of the twenty-first of Marcb, 1794, of the Constitutional Society, and of the twentieth of March, of the London Cores ponding Society, returning their thanks for the lecture, and the proceedings, uj the Fast-day ; and the witness says, that the lecture was re-printed in London, in the yeat 1794. 
EYRE 12246 The next witness is Henry Alexander; be was a member of the London Corresponding Society, belonging to the division which met at Robins’s coffee-house, Shire-lane: thst be was the ninety-fifth member of that division; he became a member in November, 1195, Yorke also was a member of that society; he remembers Yorke being them when the 1000 
EYRE 12247 was quite full; there were between sixty and a on people; that Yorke took his leave of the society by a speech ;:that he talked of going to some place, which he called Bel-gsum; that he understood him, he was to head the French army, and that they would be ripe fur a revolution by Christmas; what was really said, how this man must have misunderstood, we cannot very well guess, but to be sure it could not have passed exactly as he understands ; and what he meant by, “ they would be ripe for a revolution by Christmas ; whether he meant, that the ap of the world, where he was poing, would be ripe for a revolution, or whether he meant, when he came home, they would be ripe for a revolution, does not at all appear, by this man’s evice, any way that you can depend upon; but, he adds, that he hoped to come to London, at the head of them ; that is, I suppose, the French; and he talked of having the honour of being a member of the convention, in France ; he hoped he should come at their head, hither; that the society would join them; that Mr. Pitt’s, the other ministers’, and the king’s heads, should be upon Temple Bar; that the king and queen of France had met with what they deserved; that the Sans Culotes were a set of brave fellows; and he hoped, when he came, that the society would not sbrink from what they pretended to be; he said, it was impossible to do any thing without some bloodshed ; he said, that there were a set of brave men at Shefiield. 
EYRE 12248 He says, that the night before this conversation , there was a ian at the meeting, who came from Sheffield, who said there were pikes at Sheffield, at six-pence a piece ; another man answered, that it would be right to have some; it would only be living upon bread and cheese for one day. After this the witness says, he went and discovered what he knew to Mr. ‘Dundas, and: the lord mayor, for he thought it was proper government should be let into the light of it; he was first asked to go to their place by a friend of his, one Smith, a delegate; he was asked to be made a member; he was there seven times in all; and this is the whole of his evidence. You see the substance of it is, he gives an account of a ve extravagant conversation, supposed to have been held by this Yorke, at the meeting ; what you will make of it, is for you to judge, 
EYRE 12249 Upon his cross-examination, he says he was a linen draper; he resides now at the Rose, in the Fleet Market; that it was at the latter end of the year, 1793, when a friend asked him to go with him to one of those divisions; that Whitehorn said Smith had asked him; that Smith, Ashley, and Baxter, were there; that nothing happened to offen him that night; some papers were read; Whitehorn bad belonged to a Society in Holborn, which. the witness did not know till afterwards; ‘that, for his-part, he never wished fox a reform in parliament; he said, that he had read a which. they gave him, to two or three of his friends; he said, he went the second time to see what they were upon; that he had not, at the first time, been desired to po but that he had been twice after he had en at Mr. Dundas’s; he says, they all shook hands with Yorke at parting. 
EYRE 12250 He says, he is not now in employment, and has not been since May; he hed been a few months at Mr. Kellerby’s, in Finsbury-square, who was a linen draper then; he has since let his shop to another person, and carries on the tayloring business; he had been before at Mr. Faulder’s, a linen draper’s, in Holborn, almost two years; he says, he was lately engaged with a Mr. Marley, in Holborn; he left him on Friday last, telling him he was going out of town; the reason, he says, for’ 
EYRE 12251 loing that was, that he thought of going to Sheffield, and it would not be convenient to pretend to remain in place, when he could not stick tu it. He was asked, what passed the other nights ; he says, he has no particularremembrance of any thing; but the third or fourth night he saw Yorke; ie heard Yorke say, he been to Newgate to see Mr. Frost; he never heard Yorke mention any thing about pikes, and he says, he does not ‘ think Yorke was at the meeting the night that the pikes were talked of. 
EYRE 12252 Gentlemen, if much depended upon the credit of this witness, there certainly are some observations that go to his discredit, upon this cross-examination ; at the same time he is not contradicted as to the facts which he hassworn, by any person that comes from the division ; it is not possible to say, that his evidence is not to have re; paid to it, having regard to it, still you will take it with those allowances that you ought to make for an account of the sort that this man has given, which is notvery correct, and not very intelligible, in every part of it; it does seem, upon the whole, if his evidence is to be depended upon, that Yorke was at this meeting; that he was then going somewhere, and he talked extravagantly, and of coming to London to head a revolution, sometime about Christmas, and hoping the society would join with him, when he did come; what is to be the effect of that upon the whole of the case, you are to judge. 
EYRE 12253 Thomas Whitehorn says, he is shopman to’ a bookseller; he became a member of the London Corresponding Society the same evening with the last witness; he says, he was there four times; he saw Yorke there once; there might be from forty to sixty people; another says, I think, from sixty to a hundred ; the room was full; Yorke seemed to be very well known; he made a very long speech ; he heard him speaking very loud; what it was, he could say nothing at all to, but he did understand something of his going abroad; he himself had lived with Mr. Owen, in Fleetstreet; afterwards he went to a Mr. Bagster, in the Strand; he saw Alexander after this, but that he himself left the society, having changed his situation, and it not being convenient to him to attend. You see he does not confirm the last witness, as to any thing Yorke said, but does confirm him as to the fact, that he was present when Yorke was resent, and when he made a speech, and that fe said he was going abroad. 
EYRE 12254 The next witness is George Widdison; he is a hair dresser and turner, at Sheffield; he says he has been a member of the society, at Sheffield, abuut two years; he saw Yorke there, at a meeting in Queen-street, not long after the execution of the king of France; he saw him at the Castle-bill, in the month of April; he used to dress his hair. It was the eneral talk uf the town, at the time the arms Bras began making, and he made a dozen of pike shafis for Gale; that Yorke inquired when they were mace; when he had finished one, he carried it to Yorke, and asked him, if it would du; he said, yes; he touk about a dozen and a half; that Mr. Wilkinson took them; he understood they were to be used in their own defence. Yorke used to say, he wanted universal suffrage, and that the sucicty were all for that; he says, there was not much disputing about the mode; that some weeks before Yorke left Sheffield, he (the witness) disagreed with him about this universal suffrage; he told him he thought the plan would not do, that they would carry it too far; to which Yorke said, “ I have studied it, and nothing else will do: he says, that there it ended; they differed in sentiment, and had no more conversation about it —he said, he expected to be paid for the pike handles by the people who took them. 
EYRE 12255 Upon his cross-examination, he said—that he was a friend, in general, to the king—that the society, in general, were—that he would Not have continued in the society if he thought they were not—that the first notion they had of universal suffrage was taken from the duke of Richmond's plan, which was read in the society, and generally approved of—he never understoud that it was meant to do any thing by force—that he did not think the people’s minds were prepared for it (by which 1 understand him tv mean, prepared for the plan)— be thought at first that it might be done without tumult or comtuotion, but that he had changed his mind. 
EYRE 12256 Hie says, he was with the society at the time of the Scotch Convention, and should have voted for the delegates, but he happened not to come in time—he understood that the convention would petition parliament, and address the nation—he said that a petition would come with more force, but he did not understand that the object of the convention was, to assume the functions of parliament; he would not have been a party to it if he had so understood—he considered himself and the society as altached to the king, and was of opinion, that the king’s preservation and the people’s liberties were inseparable—there was nothing said of arnss to attack the king and overnment—he does not know that he ever eard arms mentioned in the society—that he made a pike for himself, which he thougtt necessary—that there was not a very good understanding between the two parttes io the town, and that this precaution was taken against people who might come without lezaj authority from the magistrate. 
EYRE 12257 He says, that he had been threatened m different companies—that the aristocrats, 3 they called thein, said, if there was an invasiva they would destroy their enemies at home first, as the French did: to which the wit ness replied, that he hoped there was not any such idea; that if there was, they showd arm themselves in their own defence; aad therefore they thought it necessary to arm themselves. He said, that the House of Lords never made a part of their conversation; he had no thought of any reformation of that sort—he says, that Yorke was a man apt get warm in conversation, he had heard him speak, but he had noreason to believe that be was not well-affected to the king—with regard to Davison’s letter, he knew nothing ot it; and he admits that he was onc of the membezs who gave thanks to Mr. Paine. ‘ 
EYRE 12258 This is the first witness you have who speaks of this plan of reform, and what the origin of it was; and to be sure itis a lesson to men of high rank and consequence in the community, and who have situations .in which they may debate and promulgate their opinions upoa the political state of the country, how they cominit them to the press in the way in which this was committed; the consequence of which is, that itis in the power of any maa to disperse them to any extent: by whic& means they find their way into the hands of Persons tvo often unequal to the task of examining and discussing such topics, and they become by that means the source of infiuite mischief to the community—and, if this is the general history of this plan of reform, that has thus found its way imto the minds of the lower orders of the peuple, it is, say, alesson that I think men of rank and property ought never to forget. 
EYRE 12259 Gentlemen, the next witness was Henry Hill, a cutler at Shetfield.—He says, he was a member of this society in the year 1792
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12260 he says, there was a mecting at the Castle-hill on the seventh of April, 1794; abuut that time there was a conversation about providinz themselves with arms; that Davison, whe was spoken of, who worked for Gale, aprhed to him to make pikes; the witness madea peuera for him, which was approved of; be had the iron on Davison’s credit, and Davisoa was to pay him for the making—he saw Davison atterwards at Camage’s—he sent to Yorke, but Yorke had just received an account of Mr. Walker's trialat Manchester, in which he was much interested; he was very much overjoyed on that account, and he would not talk about these pikes—he said, he saw one after that, which was finished, Yorke bad it ua his hand, but he did not converse about it, he was only playing with the children—he says, he made a hundred and thirty pikes for Davison; he had two-pence apiece for workmanship—he says, he saw Davison’s letter; that Davison said, he did not know but they might have the same occasion for pikes in London as they had in Sheftield, if they were attacked by any unlawful set of men, that they might defend themselves. 
EYRE 12261 Upon his cross-examination he says, he would not have been a member if he thought they intended to oppose the king; he never heard any declarations of that sort at Sheffield ; the society always appeared friendly to the king; for any thing he saw by them he Tever saw any thing to make him think the contrary; all they wanted was, a more equal representation in the Commons House of Parliament: they followed the duke of Richmond’s plan—there were some pikes prepared, on account of the opposite party using such threats; that they have come in the dead of the. mght; they called the place where he was Jacobin hall, and they called them levellers and Jacobins—there were an armed set of People who paraded the street, and fired into people’s houses; when going home at twelve ’clock at night, they have shot under a person’s door—he says, that they never intended to attack the magistrates —he knows nothing at all of the vote of thanks to Paine. 
EYRE 12262 The next witness, Robert Moody, is a joiner, who also lives at Sheffield, and wasa member of this society—He says, they had district meetings, division meetings he knew Henry Yorke, he was sometimes chairman; he saw him at the meeting upon the Castle Hill; he thinks there were not fewer than ten thousand people assembled ; that the populace drew Yorke home; that Camage was there reading some resolutions, which he saw afterwards in the Sheffield newspaper; that Broomhead acted as secretary
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12263 The society consisted in the whole, if all assembled, of six hundred; and the rest, according to his account, were the mere populace assembled, many of them probably could not hear any thing that passed. 
EYRE 12264 Gentlemen, you see, here is a vote of ten thousand people obtained in this manner; and it is a remarkable circumstance, that the motion for petitioning parliament was concerted to be rejected in the meeting of the junto before they came there. This gives us an excellent idea of what a debate in such an assembly as that must be. 
EYRE 12265 The witness says, that Broomhead was secretary at this meeting—that Camage brought him four or five pikes, and bespoke. three dozen of handles; that the blades were brought afterwards for the whole ; that he did not inguire what they were for, nor did he know who they were for; that Camage said aman of the name of Davison was to take them from him; that he was to be paid ready money for them when they were done. 
EYRE 12266 —He remembers a report that they were to be used against people by whom they "y posed they might be illegally attacked; for report, and only report as he knew of, had said they should be dispersed—They had met frequently in large meetings, and many of opposite principles said they should be dispersed ; and that very likely they might. get some authority from the justice of the peace, for that a little might procure that; and they got these arms to defend themselves if they should be illegally attacked
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12267 He says, that there were dragoons in the neighbourhood of Sheffield; that he saw a model of a night-cat; he asked the use of it, carnage said, it was an instrument to throw int street to prevent horses travelling, and from the appearance of it he thought it might have that effect; he said, he did not recollect that the man mentioned any town where they had been used.—He saw a few pikes brought into Camage’s by another man — that Davison asked him to let a letter or two be directed to his house for him, Davison. — : Upon his cross-examination he says—he was not a member at the time the delegates went to Scotland—he never heard that an night-cats in fact were made, but that this thing, which seemed to he a model, lay in the shop open, he says, he never heard any thing said against the RIDE? that he himself was a friend to the king; that he believed the king to be a good man, and it would be a crime to do any thing against a good man, that is a very good idea as far as it goes, but in fact it is not that description of loyalty to the prince which the occasion seemed to call for. He says, there was no talk of pikes till after the threats had been made use of—he says, he made two dozen and nine handles, and Widdison made a few more, and that is all he knows of; that these were made two or three weeks before the volunteer company were raised at Sheffield; and he says, that their apprehension was, that these pcople might take upon themselves to disperse the meeting, without any magistrate being present, or sending any legal authority for it. The next witness is John Edwards, a silversmith, a young man, who was a member of the London Corresponding Society.—He says, he knew that the prisoner was secretary to that society, and he received from bim a direction to a man at Sheffield. In the month of April, 1794, he went to Mr. Hardy, to desire that he would enclose a few lines to a person at Sheffield who could inform him of some persons who could forge blades for ikes; and then Hardy read part ofa letter to im, and gave him a direction to a person; that the plan was, to forge blades there for the people at Shefheld—the witness says—I spoke to two or three members of the Corresponding Society, and I understood that several of tent wished to furnish themselves with pikes. “ He says, that a meeting was to have taken place on the Friday before the prisoner was aken up, at the Parrot, in Green Arbour Court, in the Old Bailey, where every one was to lay down his money, and then the blades were to he sent up from Sheftield, and each was to pay a shilling.—He says, he belonged to the twenty-ninth division; he was sometimes present at the twenty-second. He was asked if he knew persons of the name of Gosling, Hillier, Baxter, and Spence ; he said yes, that the two last were delegates to some division: he mentioned the circumstance of pikes to Baxter, Spence, and Hillier. He understood from some of the members that there was a place in the Borough where they might learn the use of the musket; that he knew two persons of the name of Higgins and Goodwin who were members of the Constitutional Society; that Goodwin told him of the place: and that he had heard at his division something of the association by Franklow, called the Lambeth Association— he saw Franklow, in a blue coat and red collar, with white waistcoat and breeches, at the dinner at the Globe tavern, on the 20th of January, 1794. 
EYRE 12268 He says, that the division, number twentytwo, met at the Three Tuns, Snow Hill, one evening, there were about sixteen of them, he was one (this was before the anniversary dinner); it had been proposed to the members to meet there to form an association like the Lambeth Association, but that no person agreed to it. 
EYRE 12269 He says, he understood that there was a secret committee, for the management of some affairs of this society; that this had been dissolved
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12270 He says, it was suspected that come person had given information who it was that had been chosen of this committee, and that Lynam was the person who was suspected; and the committee which was dissolved had power to elect a new one; that Martin, Thelwall, Baxter, Moore, Hodgson, or Lovett, were elected the secret committee ; that they received letters, and every thin -was left to them what they should do wit! them, it was kept a secret from the society— sometimes they read letters at the division. 
EYRE 12271 The witness says, he was some time a dele‘gate; he attended the general committee of lelegates about six times; the delegates returned all the new members; that they had met dt Compton street, they were removed afterwards to Beaufort Buildings, to Thelwall’s
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12272 The Corresponding Society deputed five persons to attend the Constitutional Society, who pg six persons; afterwards they met ; that there was a debate about the wwitness’s age at the general committee of delegates, Thelwall and Baxter spoke upon that debate ; there was a debate, also, about the medals which were to be presented to the jury who had acquitted Eaton. 
EYRE 12273 He says he was present at the theeting at Chalk-farm; that the meeting was to have been held in Store-street, Tottenham-court
EYRE 12274 [isig road, but they went from thence to Chalk. farm; the witness had a card, or ticket, fx his admissien, which he procured from the committee of the Corresponding Societs, Compton-street, on the Thursday night pre ceding the meeting at Chalk- farm; that Mr. Addington, a justice of the peace, prevented their meeting in Store-street; he supposes there were two thousand persons, or upwards, at Chalk-farm ; a person stoud at the doer to take the tickets; he tore the tickets in half; he kept one half, the other half was put in their hats
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12275 There was a kind of trap-ball ground they met in, which was connected with the long room; they found some of the members of the Corresponding Societs ther ; he particularly mentioned Moore, Hodgson, Thelwall, Lovett, and Richter — Lovett was called to the chair—He does not recollect whether Mr. Hardy was there or no.—He says, there were two ladies there he was srquainted with, he went up with them into the long room, and they were locked in, therefor he could not see so well—he could give no report of the proceedings at Chalk-farm—he dves not recollect ever hearing the proceedings at Chalk-farm reported to the committee, or any of the societies, because most of the members heard it there. He says, he knows Robins’s Coffee-house, that is where the division number twenty-nive met; he was formerly a member of that div sion.—He says he received about this time of the meeting at Chalk-farm a paper from Baxter, about the size of the paper produced, and he believes it to be the same as the paper produced.—That paper must be read. 
EYRE 12276 This is undoubtedly a most infamous ani detestable paper; what it points at is to plain to be mistaken; and how it is possibk it should have happened that a man who prefesses to have an object which he thinks lavudable, and other people may agree that be may think it laudable, should have disgrace? himself by the publication of such a paper ss this, is hard to smyself but whether it fairly cennects with the subject of the present Indictment, soas fairly to heinterwoven into the cunspiracy with which this pri8oner is charged, is another consideration, which you will weg": fully, and give it that weight which it deserves, and not give it more, enormous and scaedalous as it is, and deserving every punishment which the law can inflict. The witness says, he thinks he received it in October o November; if so, probably what he received was not dated the 1st of April, as this paper is, hut was dated the 30th of January; thst date agrees with the subject you see, and 5 not unlikely to have been the real date of this paper; whether he is correct im saying he received it in the month of October or Ne vember will depend upon his recollectioa. 
EYRE 12277 He says, that from Chalk-farm they west 
EYRE 12278 -to Conspton-street, where his division used to meet; they supped, and staid there till eleven o'clock; Thelwall was there
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12279 He says, that there was a meeting upon the 2d of May, 1794, at the Crown and Archer-tavern, at which he was present, having a ticket given him by Mr. Joyce for the anniversary dinner; that the address from the Globe-tavern was read before dinner at that meeting, and distributett afterwards; the paper which he spoke of, he received at the Three Tuns on Snow-hill, which was after the 20th of January: therefore, I apport that paper was the address from the Globe-tavern, according to his former evidence, he says, he has been at Thelwall’s lectures—that a a of pikes was to bea shilling for each blade. d 
EYRE 12280 He was asked as to Gosling and Hillier— he says, he knows them; they came to his father’s house on the Monday, he mentioned 
EYRE 12281 ‘before there having been a meeting appointed in Green Arbour-court, to lay down money for the pikes ;the meeting was postponed to the following Friday. While Costing and Hillier were with him they heard that Hardy was apprehended (that accounts for their not having the pikes); he did understand they meant to have attended the meeting on the Friday—that fir was recommended for shafts to these pikes—he had a pike made himself: 
EYRE 12282 be destroyed the blade upon the Wednesday after he heard Hardy was in custody, being afraid it should be found. He was asked if he had a magic lanthorn? he said he had one—that it had nothing but the destruction -of the Bastile and the beheading the governor 
EYRE 12283 ‘ painted on it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12284 He says he knows Hillier; that he had a pike, but not of the same construction as his. 
EYRE 12285 Upon his cross-examination he says, he became a member of the Corresponding Sopeg July was twelve month; that he 
EYRE 12286 5 lea pike for himself in March, 1794—he says he heard Yorke at Robins's Coffee-house say, that they had pikes at Sheffield; and he says, he understood that severat members had furnished themselves with arms—he says, it i was just about the time the Hessian troops had been landed without the consent of parliament; but he says, he had no intention to 
EYRE 12287 ‘ use these arms against the government of the country—he meant to get pikes for some who might want them for the same purpose as, he says, he did, to defend himself in case there should be any illegal dispersions of the meet-ings, not against any legal power, but only against illegal attacks upon them; that a great deal of opposition had been shown to their meetings when they proposed to assoClate. 
EYRE 12288 He says, Hardy was always very quiet in the division; he never used any improper expressions; that Hardy made no propositions for arms or pikes; that he told Hardy, he had made a pike. He says that Baxter gave that bill, La Guillotine, to two or three persons; and he, wishing for one, got that which he produced ; he says, he does not know that Har. fascial that; he does not think he would have approved of it; the first bill was of another edition. He understood Hardy knew who the persuns were to whom he was to send for pikes; he says that the pikes were made at the time the Hessian troops were landed. He had notice that there were some spirited Resolutions by the Sheffield Society; he learnt it from a bouk he purch at Eaton’s shop
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12289 He says that his society met without the use of any weapons for two years previous to that time; but he heard that a division in Bunhill-row had been often interrupted by the police officers. 
EYRE 12290 Now, the material fact upon this young man’s evidence with regard to the prisoner, is, that it adduces pretty strong provt that the letter had been received by Hardy from Davison, and that he had, in some sort, acted upon it; whether he had proposed it publicly at the division, or no, yet that he had such a letter, and could tell them where those pikes were to be got; in consequence of that, he madean application to Hardy; and in consequence of that applicatiun, there was to have been a meeting at the Parrot in Green Arbour court, where as many as chose to have pikes were to pay the money; which certainly connects Hardy with these pikes, so far as that transaction goes. 
EYRE 12291 The neat witness is Samuel Williams; he says, he is a gun engraver; that he was a member of the Londun Corresponding Society; he knew Franklow; he saw hinyin his own house ; he was also a member of the Corresponding Society; that Franklow had applied to him to make some arms tor him; he saw the feast advertised, and went to Hardy fora ticket ; Hardy said, it was not usual to give tickets to those who were not me nbers ; he ave him one of the addresses, and said, it was for a reform in parliament. The witness says, he gave Hardy an order forsome shoes, which Hardy made; and then he told Hardy, he was in a line for selling guns; Hardy desired him the next time he came, to bring a gun with him; he broaght him one; Hardy sold it, he then gave Hardy «n order for a pair of boots; Hardy bid him bring two or three guns, which he sold likewise; and one gun was in the house, which was not sold, when the prisoner was apprehended. 
EYRE 12292 He says, he Draws Spence, of Little Turnstile; he had seen Franklow there; he went to Spence’s to instruct persons in the manuat exercise, at the request of Mr. Frankluw; that they exercised in a one or two pair of stairs room, between eight and ten in the evening; and he thinks that the curtains of the room were down; they used to mcet on Thursday night. He says, he became a member by Mr. Hardy’s recommendation, ahout a fortnight or three weeks after his first seeing him, He says, he knew a society called the Loyal Lambeth Association ; that was the association to which these people belonged ; 
EYRE 12293 he says, he went to exercise. them at Frank-of the fact; they were members of the Lonlow’s house, No, 1, China Walk, Lambeth :don Corresponding Society, and therefore, a that Hardy gave him Franklow’s card, andfar as the matter went, were providing them told him, Franklow was ging to raise an as-selves with arms, and, as far as the circunsociation, and would want guns.

EYRE 12295 The printed Articles were produced, which Williams was called again. He says, thet describe how they were to be armed; and it| he remembers a avangs conversatioa m states, that the inhabitants of Lambeth wereHardy’s shop, about how long would be bein getting a thousand guns ; be said, that it was a thing far beyond his capacity, to meapeg such an order; and therefore there was no more conversation about it: I de not thmk much is to be made of that; the man wass stranger ; Hardy did not appear to join in the conversation; it seems to end im nothing; and I do not think you can connect it so asmake any thing out of it; therefore I do ont mean to state it as a circumstance upon whxb you can raise any thing. 
EYRE 12296 The next witness is George Sanderson, who says that he was at Shelmerdine’s, in the Borough, upon the second of April; he says, be went there to decide a bet; that he saw there, about seven or eight stand of arms, and some men exercising, who belonged to an armed society; that they were members of the Londua Corresponding Society ; that their numbers were about twenly-six or twenty-seven; be says he might have seen about twenty-icur or twenty-five together at Shelmerdine’s; he says they objected to him because he was not amember of the London Corresponding Se ciety, but they admitted him upon his promising to become a member ; he understood that they were to obtain a reform of parizment at the point of the bayonet ; be does not mention who said that, nor what the particular expressions of the conyersation were from which he collects that, but that he collected it from their general conversation. 
EYRE 12297 He says that they adjourned to the house of one Day, in Worcester-street, where there was a private committee, who had settled certain places where they were to assemble, he says that one of the meetings was at Spence’s, another at a shed in Westminster, near Tothill Fields Bridewell; he attended Pretty constantly; sometimes at ‘s sometimes in Westminster, from the eleventh of April to about the first of May ; they were taught the manual exercise by one Ost, whe had. served la pe Franch my a sq a member. of the Correspo! fe say8 that Shelmerdine was a hatter, that he frequently changed his men; and be end one reqson for removing from Shelmerdine’s, alarmed with apprehensions of an invasion and civil commotion; that therefore they Meant to associate ; that part of them met at the Borough; that a condition of the association was. not to go beyond the parish of Lambeth ; that they proposed to divide into ten divisions. He says their conversatiqn was about a parliamentary reform ; but, from conVersation with Franklaw, he understood, that, if they did not get a reform in parliament, they would have it ly force of arms; that none but members of the London Corresponding Society attended this Lambeth Association. 
EYRE 12298 You sce, this man speaks of guns, which he supplied to Hardy and to Franklow, for this Lambeth Association ; with regard to what he supplied to Hardy, I think you can hardly raise much implication from that upon Hardy; it isa mutual concern in trade; this man begun it by buying shvues of Hardy ; and he intimated to Hardy that he was in the gun line; in consequence of which, Hardy gave him an order, and he gave Hardy another order; and then Hardy gave him another order, and he disposed of muskets for him, which he might do, for all that I see from that part of the case, very innocently ; Lut it has somewhat of a different complexion with respect to Franklow’s Association ; for, if any thing is to be objected to that association, there Is something to object to Hardy, for having given this man a card to Franklow, gad mentioning his association. 
EYRE 12299 Now, that this association was to be objected to, is evident from the circumstances of the case; for, you see, this is an association carried on in a private and clandestine manner; they meet in small parties, exercising in a room, ata late hour, the curtains down, and circumstances of concealment, and a concealment, very contrary to what might be expected in the ordinary case of an association, where people are proud of their arms, and of appearing in their uniform ; so that nothing seems to account for their proceeding in that clandestine manner; therefure the Lambeth Association seems an assumed name, and not warranted by the real circumstances was, that they thought some of his men might not be staunch to the cause; that was his expression. 3 
EYRE 12300 He says he was one night at a meeting of the division in Shire-lane, a member mentioned a circumstance which was: mot proeeeded upon, and therefore does not seem to amount to much; that Mr. Pitt was to go over one of the bridges at twelve ofclock at night; somebody pe) it was very improper to make any comment upon that, and nothing more passed upon it; he says there had been news of a defeat of the British army, which they of this society treated as good news; he says that one of them said he had the pleasure to inform the society that one of the king’s messengers had been killed in the country ; another said if it had been his own son should have been glad; he savs there were frequent intimations to take care of spies; that there was a proposition that ten should meet at one house—that is; nine of them to meet at the house of the tenth; they talked of blowing a spy’s brains out. The witness was asked what he was, if he was not a spy— he says he was; that they were talking of a reform of parliament at the point of the Dayonet ; that that appeared to be the intention of this armed society from the general conversation. 
EYRE 12301 Now the circumstance mentioned by this witness of the manner in which these people were shifting about under the direction of a Secret Committee, to be exercised in small numbers at different places, with the observation that was made in regard to Shelmerdine’s frequently changing his men, with the apprehension that his men might not be staunch to the cause, certainly warrants very great suspicion that this armed society was forming for no good purposes, and that this is, therefore, a circumstance which does make part of atie case which is now under consideration; pr it is,Ithink, if this evidence be true, impossible to suppose that this was a regular volunteer society, who were only arming themselves for these ostensible purposes exalti in these articles; they state strange language to have been used by these people, you will judge what credit is due to that evidence ; if they did use such language, it shows that their minds, at least, must have been in 2 state of very creat irritation, and that they had designs not fit for honest men to entertain, and which must create real apprehensions in the minds of all those who know that such designs were conceived by such men. 
EYRE 12302 Edward Gosling, who was also a member of the Correspwnding Society, says that upon the fifteenth of Anril, 1794, he was admitted a member; that Mr. Wickham, a magistrate, had desired him to he proposed; that he went to Hillier to inquire after a man he happened to know that was a member of that society ; he says what led him to go to Hillier was, that having seen seditious pamphlets there, he thought he might be able to leartt frorh him where this man was; he says that he concluded ftom the circumstance of these pamphlets being sold there that he was a member of the Corresponding Society. —that led him to inquite of Hiller after thts tan; he sdys, he was proposed without any communication with the magistrate; but he attended afterwards in order to discover whether they really had atty intention to arm. 
EYRE 12303 He says that the division he belonged to was number eleven, meeting in Northamptonstreet, Clerkenwell, he did not recollect: the sigh, but the man that kept the house was named Holt; he says that there was some conversation about the meeting at Chalk Farm, which had been on the day before that it was said to be necessary to arm for the purpose of defending the Convention as they had done in France. 
EYRE 12304 If this was a fact well established, it would be a very strong faet indeed in the case, because wheri you once stippose the idea to be that the Convention was to meet without arms, to act peaceably and in order, and that the others were to defend them with arms, that would give that Convention a complexion to be sure of a very dangerous nature indeed, and would go a great way to warrant every thing that has been said of it. But you wilt remember that this very strong fact 1s stated by a man of Gosling’s description, to whom some exceptions in point of credit lay, the weight of which you will weigh in your minds. 
EYRE 12305 He says that the Convention was to be called in about six weeks; that they talked of repelling force by force, if Mr. Dundas should bring his Scotch laws into England; that the expression used was, “ The infamous and ever to be detested Court of Justiciary in Scotland; he says that there were one or two hundred thousand copies of the proceeds ings and resolutions of that day ordered to be printed. 
EYRE 12306 On the Monday after this, he says he was at another division mecting at one Mortis’s, a jack-maker’s, in Brick-lane; that division, he believes, was called number sixteen and twenty-five; doctor Hodgson was recommended by the committee to be relieved; he says that he and Hillier went to see this doctor Hodgson, who, I take it, was at that time in Newgate; they found Lloyd, Roussel, and a captain Williams, an Amcrican, with Hodgson; there was a conversation with doctor Hodgson, he asked the witness if he had seen a copy of the new constitution, by which this Corresponding Suciety was to be divided into small divisions to learn the use of arms at one another’s houses; that it was almost ready—that they were to be called tythings —that their object was, to keep spies from getting into the society ; their numbers’ were tncreasing, and they would soon be irresistible. The witness observed that there were ne men of property among them, to which Roussel made this reply, that as soon as they were organized, money should not be wanting. That will also be a very strong circumstance in the case, if you should be of opinion that this witness is deserving of credit. He says that Lloyd gave a toast— “ The world a republic or a desart. Doctor Hodgson said he hoped soon to see a Revolutionary Tribunal established in this country, for he hated all others; Roussel said he was going fram thence to Thelwall’s, and he should set off next day. Hillier asked if he was going to France, he said, yes. 
EYRE 12307 The witness says he was that evening at the division he belonged to, the eleventh division, that one Wright, a delegate, was there; that when he was coming away, Wright asked him if he had got any arms? he said no; Wright told him it would be necessary that all should have arms, as possibly we might very soon be compelled to use them ; he says Gordon was their secretary, that Gordon said he was going to America, that he was very sorry to Teave the society just as they were going to act as well as tu think, and to regeDerate their country; that he should take some copies of their spirited resolutions to be delivered to the popular societies in America, Hillier mentioned his not having got a musket, but he said he had got a pike. 
EYRE 12308 He says on the twenty fifth of April he was at Hillier's house, number eighty or eighty-one, in Bishopsgate street; that there was a person there whose name he was told was Wicksly, and there was a drunken man there, and a man of the name of Bennet; Wicksly said he had received a letter from Shetheld, stating that there had been a numerous meeting there, and that they had determined to petition no more fura parliamentary reform ; that there were some knives making of a particular construction at Sheffield; that the letier contained a drawing of the knives, that they were to be fixed to poles, and they talked of their use being to cut the reins of the horses; that the principal dependance of the society consisted in securing the royal family and both houses of parliament. Hillier said if they could resist the first shock from the army, there would be no danger afterwards: the king being secured, the army would have no head to look up to, and would be gine to accept the additional vay that would be offered them; that men would not fight for six pence a day if they could have a larger sum; he says that nobudy objected to all this. He says when he was going away, Bennet went out with him into the street; that his conversation was so violent, and he spoke su luud, that he the witness checked him, for that persons walking by would take Dotice of what he said. 
EYRE 12309 He says he knows Baxter, that on the ninth af May he had a material conversation with Baxter at Hillier’s house; he says Baxter stated that he had been with Mr. Joyce, who was secretary to earl Stanhope; that Baxter, 
EYRE 12310 ; why do not you blow them all up 
EYRE 12311 Bennet, and Hillier were at Hillier’s, and some other persons at a part of this conversation; Baxter said there was no danger to be apprehended for Stone, that is the apprehended for high treason, for he too much firmness to let them get any thas out of him: he said that the mittee of Correspondence and Co-operation were preparing an address to the army, with some fe solutions, and he said that prudent and dete. mined men were wanted to 2 the opinions contained in those resolutions; be said that one Moore had been active and successful in getting over the army; that they had most to fear from the young recruits, they had succeeded best with the old soldiers; that if one-third of the army were got over, the others would not do mach. Then the fact was mentioned of Baxter's hav. ing an interview with some officers; that Baxter said one of the officers said to him, together. He says, that Baxter asked him if he knew who would buy a pike, the witness said, he should have no objection to purchase cee, but it would be of no service unless he knew how to use it; he says. Baxter said, if be would go the Thursday or Friday following, to the Parrot in Green Arbour Court, in tbe Old Bailey, and ask for one Edwards, be 
EYRE 12312 ; would be called out to him, that he was to tell Edwards that Baxter had sent him, thea he was to have a pike, and that he would be introduced to others with whom he might learn the use of them, that Edwards was a very clever fellow, and could teach him, that pikes were much cheaper than muskets, that muskets could not be supplied on account ef their expense —and that people might do mischief if they did not know how to use 
EYRE 12313 ‘ them. 
EYRE 12314 ‘The witness says, he observed they might have a parliamentary reform without coming to blows, upon which Baxter said; “ Is there a man in the society, that believes a parliamentary reform is all we want? No, not one —he said that many men of property bad hitherto kept back on account of the sanguinary conduct of the French, but that they were now willing to come forward, as they were convinced a revolution might be effected ina few hours—that he, Baxter, did not wish the king or any of his family to lose their own lives, he thought they might go to Hanover, but that it must be expected that some blood must be shed, for some poreuler persons bad offered such insults to the people that human nature could not overlook. 
EYRE 12315 He says the conversation afterwards turned upon Thelwall’s having been indicted, in which there was nothing very material —He said he attended most to Baxter’s conversation, because he was informed he was one of the Committee of Correspondence and Cooperation. Baxter said many thousand pikes were making at Sheffield, that the heads were only to come from thence, and that they were - to be stecked in town; -he recommended that ? pothing of that should be mentioned at any. of the divisions, till the new constitution should be adopted, for there were spies in the society; that it would be adviseable to let the French prisoners out, if the emigrants resisted, that the emigrants should share the fate of the Swiss at Paris. He mentioned the names of Mr. Pitt, Mr. Dundas, Mr. Reeves, and other persons who had offered such insults nto the poorle that human nature could not everluok. He says, in going home with Baxter, he oe tood from. conversation he had with him, that the address to the army, was to set the troops and the emigrants, to be embodied, -. at variance, and they were to say to the army, that they had sworn to fight for the king and ; country, and if they were at variance, the might choose which side they pleased; that it would be proper to enlarge upon the severity of their usage, and the smallness of their pay, ba they must first sound their principles, and if they found the soldiers were Aristocrats, thea they must not go on. He saysthat with Tespect to all these circumstances, he comMunicated them from time to time to Mr. Wickham, that be gave him intelligence of woat ro On his cross-examination, he is asked what “ situation he was in, he said he kept a broker’s shop—he is asked if he did not deal in king’s ; Stores, he said he did say to a man to whom he was unwilling to give his name, that he dealt in naval stores, thinking that would put the man off from any farther inquiry—he says that he is employed by a magistrate, in Worship-street, which occasioned him to say that—he denies that he lived by smuggling, and cheating the king io his stores. "He was asked if he ever went by the name Of Douglas; he says he did for six years, while he carried on the business of a hair’ dresser, which is ten years since, in Petty France, at No. 3. He says his fatherhada shop of business in the city, that hewisbed to go out for improvement, and did notlike to appear as a journeyman, when his’ father kept four or five men in his own house ; that his taking the name of Douglas, was a mere accidental circumstance. 
EYRE 12316 He was asked if he knowsa Mr. Lincoln, whocollects rents for Mr. Macnamara; he sayshe does, and that he borrowed from Mr. Lincola, four or five years ago, ten pound, or ten guineas, and gave him a note for it, in the name of Douglas, while he bore that name, which has been since paid. He says Mr. Macnamara caine to him to the coffeehouse, where he and the other witnesses were; that he behaved so ill to him, that he was much flurried, and did not know what he said; that Mr. Macnainara came to the coffeehouse to him, and said that the note would appear against him if it was not paid. 
EYRE 12317 He was asked whether he not by inflammatory expressions, excited these people to say the things which he had stated—he says that he may have appeared to have approved of what was doing, but he never did approve of it — particularly that he never said, “ why don’t the society learn the use of arms. 
EYRE 12318 He is then asked as to a Mrs. Coleman, who had lived with him, and died in his house; he says he made her will, and that no partofher property was left to her relations —he is asked if a brother of a former husband had not made some charge agaiust him—he says he never heard any complaint, or an charge against his conduct respecting the will, but that a brother had come up to make a claim. He is asked if he knows one Cox, cheesemonger—he says hehas dealt with him, and he did not use him very well, but nothing turns upon that, for he is not called. Then there was a print produced, which was found upon Roussel, it is an engraving of the manual exercise of soldiers, with caps upon their heads, intended to be painted red —you understand that it is the cap of libert now worn in France, and is a sort of signal, by which men who entertain these opinions may be known. 
EYRE 12319 Gentlemen, I stated to you before, that this witness has given very important evidence, tending to show the determined purpose of this Convention to use force against the king, his family, and the government—If this man’s evidence can be depended upon, he certainly states Baxter to use very strong language, so indiscreet, that one could hardly have thought that a man would have ventured to use—and on the other band, the observation made upon this, is certainly founded, that this man is not contradicted with regard to the testimony that he gives, and that all they rely upon to shake his credit, is what turns out upon his cross-examination—the account he gives of himself, of bis having told a man that he dealt in naval stores, for a vile purose—having borne the name of Douglas— fering acted about in that sort of way, and going there for the purpose of firing information to government. gentlemen, it is your province to judge what degree of credit you think fit to give to this man’s evidence. 
EYRE 12320 The next witness, is Joha Groves—he is another man, whose credit is more directly impeached than Gosling’s has been, who also speaks materially, it his evidence is true. He says he was at the Globe tavern, on the twentieth of January, 1794; he became a member early in the month of February, he was desired to become a member, in order to make a discovery; he says there was a very large assembly, he believes Mr. Martin was called to the chair, who read an address, and Mr. Richter read it over again; he does not recollect any particular toast which was drank, but a great many were read; and by a paper that was printed, he should be able to refresh his memory—he says in general, the conversation was universal suffrage, and annual parliamentsthat their object was to enlighten men’s minds, to embrace opportunities of instruction, to learn the natural freedom of ali mankind, that-he heard nothing about arms. 
EYRE 12321 He says, he was present at Thelwall’s lecture ; that it was a general abuse of the administration, and the branches of the legisla: ture : he spoke of the king in terms of contempt; he used the word Solomon, ironically;. he said, that the House of Lords was an eristocratic branch, which swallowed up almost all other functions of the government; that he recommended a convention, in order to procure annual parliaments and universal suffrage; and that he recommended a new modelling of the House of Commons. 
EYRE 12322 He says, he was at Chalk-farm; Hardy was there; that Lovett was in the chair; that there were printed papers dispersed; there was a letter trom the Corresponding Society to the Friends of the People, earnestly soliciting the concurrence and assistance of that society, in assembling a convention of the friends of freedom, for the purpose of obtaining, ina legal and constitutional method, a full and effectual representation ; he says, the answer was read from the Friends of the People to the Corresponding Society, dated April the eleventh, 1794, and then their letter; a number of resolutions were put, and two hundred thousand copies ordered to be published. 
EYRE 12323 Groves says, he went to a house in Storestreet, Tottenham Court Road, where the meeting was to be held; he went part of the way with Thelwall; he says there was a written paper upon the dour of the house, in Store-strect, stating that the mecting was to be held at Chalk-farm; he says, Lovett was in the chair; the principal persons who spoke and acted at that mecting, were Lovett, Richter, Thelwall, and Hodgson; that Thelwall made two or three speeches; he says, there was aclamour went round that there were spies and informers there; Mr. Thelwall said, he was for admitting all spies and informers there, because the number of the members of the London Corresponding Society could be no agreeable news to the minister ; he says Richter read the resolutions ; that Richter stopt reading to make some observation of his own; upon which Hardy said “ read, sir, without comment ; this was when Richter was reading the address. 
EYRE 12324 The witness says, he returned to the division room, in Compton-street ; that ‘Thelwall was in the chair; that Thelwall, taking a pot of porter in his hand, he blew off the head of the porter, and said, this is the way I would have all kings served, or this is the way I would serve all kings. Being asked, if an particular toast was given, he says that Thelwall gave—The lantern, or Jamp-iron at the end of Parliament-street; he called for some one to cover it; to give another toast I suppose ; and somebody cried out,—The ‘treasury-bench; he thinks there was mo visitor there, at this time; ‘he says, that Green was a member, and that he liad a private conversation with hia in the coffee-room ; that be talked of annual parliaments and universal suffrage ; but he said, these were only to be considered as ladders to obtain their ends. 
EYRE 12325 He says, there was a kind of shed at Chalkfarm, in which they were eating bread and cheese, and drinking porter; that several people there pulled out a cutting instrumest, corresponding with each other; a sort of French knife, which when the elasp was opened, iLprevene its joint working, so that it was fixed straight forward ; that Pearce had one; somebody said, they were bread end cheese knives; upon that observation there was a smile; he says, he looked upon them as harmless instruments, certainly ; be asked, where they were to be had; they said he might have some of Green; he asked, where Green was to be found; they ‘said, he wass perfumer and hair-dresser, in Orange-strec, Leicester- fields. 
EYRE 12326 He says he went to Greent’s for one of these knives; Green said, he had sold between twe and three hundred; that Green teld him te speak very low; the parlour door was oper, which was adjoining the shep, and he smied, and said, for my wite is a damned aristocrat: that he attended the meetings regularly; tht Pearce, wheh they were at Chalk-farm, sad, if you strike with them, speaking of these knives, they wil not fly back, or words to that purpose; he says a man, from Sheffic’d, found fault with the construction of these knives ; he said they might be made better; that they were not equal to those at Sheikeld. 
EYRE 12327 He says, he was at a mecting, when a subscription was proposed for Dr. Hodeson, which application was rejected, on the ground of the violence of his conduct; and there was another reason, if the witness's memory wz right, that he was not considered as a member; he said he was present at the Crown and Anchor tavern, upon the second ef May; that there was a division meetinz in February, when an address from Stockpert, was read ; that was division namber two an4 number three, in Compton-street ; this beisz so late as the fifth of January, 1794, it will be proper to read that paper. 
EYRE 12328 Gentlemen, the whole of the paper, in point of general inflammation, is very bad: but & is the last passage which is materiully connected with the present case, and the date ss material, the fifth of January 1794. 
EYRE 12329 Jobin Groves went on to say, that the prisener came to his house, in Crown-court, Co vent-garden, and brought him a ticket for the dinner, on the second of May, at the Crcwn and Anchor; he said he paid nothing for it:was the annual dinner of the Constitetivnal Society, and there was a eertain number of the Corresponding ‘Society invited, about twenty in all he said there was some news came, while they were there, of some public event; he understood it was very bad news ; that it seemed to give universal satisfaction ; that there was a song, called “‘lhe Free Constitution, delivered out before dinner, and there was a paper on each plate, but he does not recollect what it was; he belicves Mr. Wharton was in the chair; that Mr. Horne ‘Tooke was. there, and the prisoner Hardy, was there; that when the company came into the room, the French popular tunes were struck up, and encored, and thev played ulmost the whole of the dinner, the Marsellois march, Ca ira, and the Carmagnol, and that it was a continual scene of clapping. 
EYRE 12330 He says, that after dinner Mr. Horne Tooke addressed himself to the company; he prefaced his address by an observation, that he supposed one out of fifty, in the room, might be considered as a government spy, and to them in particular he wished to address himself; and the witness says, in consequence of his addressing himself to government spies, he did attend to what he said; he begged the company to take netice, that he was not inebriated, for, having something to say to the company, he teek oare to refrain trom his pass and for fear of being mistaken, and eing taken to be in a state of intoxication, he begged every body present to take particuJar notice of what he said ; he called the parliament a scoundrel sink of corruption; and the opposition he called a scoundrel sink of opposition ; that a juaction betwen these two scoundrel parties was formed, for the purpose of destroying the rights and liberties of the country. He spoke about the House of Lords, the hereditary nobilzy ; he asked if that skipjack, naming a particular lord, could be considered as one of the hereditary nobility; he said the same of the House of Lords as of the House of Commons, he said the junto between the two parties was in order to amuse or abuse that poor man, the king; he said, that the junction of partics in the House of Commons, was in order to abuse and deceive the people of this country, He says, Mr. Tooke's speech was received with great applause ; that there was a song sung, to the tune of “ God save the king, but not those words: he says, that Mr. Horne Tooke sung an additional verse of the song; he had furgot what that was. 
EYRE 12331 Upon his cross-examination, he says he follows the business of a conveyancer, and has done so two and twenty years; he is not an attorney; he was asked, whether he was a solicitor; he said be did not understand what was meant by the question; at last he admitted, that he was a solicitor, in this Place; a solicitor for prosecutions and prisoners; he said, when Thelwall and he conversed, that Thelwall rather fixed himsclf upon him, than he upon Thelwall; he said there were a number of very respectable gentlemen, at the Crown and Anchor; that Mr. Tooke spoke highly of the hereditary nobility of the country; -he said, they .had lest their weight in the state, by the introduction of the new nobility, who had been introduced into the House of Lords, by means of their conduct ia the House of Commons; he said he spoke highly of the office of the king, in the constitution ; he said, that the new made peers, or those lately introduced into the House of Lords, either had combined, or were combining, for the purpose of amusing that poor man, the king; that the king had lost his true weight in the constitution, by means of this corruption; he says the object ofall his conversation was, that improper people were brought into the House of Commons, and that thereby the evil complained of arose. They then read a song, which was found at Hardy’s house, in a letter addressed to Hardy, without date ; that song must be read. 
EYRE 12332 Gentlemen, I would observe to you, upon this song, what perhaps may occur upon some other parts of the evidence. It was fairly observed, on the part of the prisoner, that there is a great deal of difference between this sort of loose paper, found at his house, in the situation he was in, as secretary to this popu society, to whom, therefore, all sorts of things would of course be addressed, which, perhaps, it would be prudent to destroy ; but every mam is not, in that respect, quite prudent; that there isa vast difference between this sort of thing, and a paper which bad been commus nicated, and acted upon, and made thereby the act of the party himself, by his own con duct upon it; the evidence could not be rejected, because the keeping such papers is some reproach to a prudent man, and affords some evidence of the improper connexions he forms, in consequence ot which all these sort of licentious things come to him. 
EYRE 12333 The next witness is John Thompson, whe proved the finding a pike at Hillier’s. 
EYRE 12334 William Camage is then examined again; he says, that he saw Margarotin the Tolbooth, at Edinburgh; that he had a spring knife upon his table; that it was hard to shut, and hy his description, something like these Sheffield knives; he says he never saw one at Sheftield; that this knife lay publicly for him to get his dinner with; there were six or seven peuple present; and it was showed te him as a curious knife. 
EYRE 12335 George Lynam says he became a member of the Corresponding Society, in October, 1792, of the division number twelve, at the sign of the Mansion House, opposite to the Mansion House; he says he received the rules of the society, and the address of the suciety, in March, 1792; having received these papers he intimated to the master of the house, that he thought it would be dangerous for him to permit the division to come to his house; that he, therefore, declined to let them come to his house; he says the division adjourned to the Crown in Newgate 
EYRE 12336 ‘street, and he was accepted. as a member of this society, upon the twenty-ninth of Octoder; he says he was at the Unicorn, Coventrden, at the division number two; that I take to be Hardy’s division; that there was a large meeting; the room was full; there might he seventy or eighty people there; Hardy appeared as secretary ; he says Paine’s Address tu the French nation, was voted to be published, and delivered out to all the divisions; that a paper called the Rights and duties of Man, was to be continued weekly ; that the delegates had received addresses, approving of the society’s address to the National Convention ; that the delegate of the division reports to the division what is done at the committee of delegates. Tt will be proper here just to observe how tbat stands
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12337 By the constitution of this society it is divided into a great number of subdivisions, us many as they have opportunity to make, consisting of not less than thirt members in a sub-division ; each of these divisions choose a delegate to represent them in a general committee of these delegates; -which general committee of delegates act for the society at large; and all such matters as are thought proper to be communicated te the divisions, are brought back to each diviSion by the delegate of that division, and communicated there.—That is the way in which this machine is framed and carried on. The witness says, upon October he was at the division, number twelve, at the Crown in Newgate-street, when the Address to the French Convention was read, it having been brought forward before at a committee of delegates. On the second of November, at the Rainbow, in Fleet street, there was a meeting of division, number eleven. There was a report that the society at Stockport had written to Sheffield, that they approved of the different meetings. There was a letter, which was a pretty long one, in which it was said, that it would be a god thing to send, as he understood it, the ndon delegates down to teach the farmers pl this letter was by the editors of the heffield paper, intituled the Patriot, and this was written to the delegates; this is afterwards produced, and it corresponds with the witness’s note; it is much fuller than his note, but as far as his note does go, it corresponds Hstiy much to the paper; only instead of sending delegates from London to teach the farmers politics, the proposition was, that the societies should send delegates from their respective societies into the country in order to enlighten the minds of the people, He says, there were six honorary members of the London Corresponding Society admitted to the society at the Crown and Anchor. A certificate of Hardy’s election to be a delegate was then produced; it was a paper found in his possession. Lynam then went on with his evidence : he gays, he-was ata meeting upon the twelfth the thirty-first of of November, at the Unicorn, of division number two; there were very loud plaady at the reading a letter from Barlow to the azvention of See ool says, it was either 
EYRE 12338 Barrere or Barlow; he seems to give buts blundering account of that, it certainly w quite another sort of thing)
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12339 lIle says, the nuniber of the suciety in London was stated to be six thousand ; it was observed, that the divisions in Spitalfields were increasing, sad soon would be equal to all the uther divisions of the society.—There was a letter from major Johnson, from Edinburgh, disapproviegat the address to the Convention sw son —he says, that the address which they had ordered to be sent to the Nationa! Conventsa in France, had been ordered to be published in France, and sent to the eighty three departments in France.—The society at Shef field had sent up their address to the com mittee of delegates, who had forwarded it the National Convention of France. The next meeting was on the twenty-first of November, of the division number twelve, at the Crown, in Newgate-street; there was a talk of a congress to be held in Scotland—A charge, which had been delivered by Mr. Justice Ashhurst to the grand jury, was read. —It was reported that the society at Norwich wanted to know if they meant to come into the duke of Richmond’s plan, or to np up monarchy; they suspected this was to draw them into some unguarded expressions, and declined answering. 
EYRE 12340 Gentlemen, you recollect, that letter was read, and that when they did answer it, the answer was more guarded than some of the letters of the society ; it was. such an answer as might naturally lead one to think that there was some suspicion ; it is a curious aicumstance, that in the notes of this man, who attended the divisions regularly, and took notes as being a delegate, it should be noted that they suspected that letter from Norwich did not come from a friend, and that it was meant to draw them into some scrape. 
EYRE 12341 He then speaks of the branching of of s new division, number twenty-three, from number twelve; and this new division met at the Ship, in Moorfields, on the tweaty-seventh of November—he says, he was chosen a delegate of this new division he was recommended by his division; and it was pees at that time that the public should be it ed that they were not levellers, and that they wished to avoid all riots and all resistence: that this arose from the magistrates having interfered with their meeting—that the conversation was, that the first cnaracters at Edinburgh belonged to the cause, had themselves into a society, and called them selves a Convention of delegates. 
EYRE 12342 Upon the twenty-ninth of November, be says, he attended a meeting of delegates 2 the Sun, in Windmill-street; there were twenty-two delegates present
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12343 His notes sre. 
EYRE 12344 that division eleven had received twenty wis'
EYRE 12345 tors from Islington; that a society was intended to be formed there. The sub-committee brought forward their answer to the Crown and Anchor Society, which was referred back, and another answer was offered, drawn by a fe of the name of Vaughan, “couusellor Vaughan, who was a visitor then from the Constitutional Society, and this was approved with some alterations; the words “ dying in the cause were struck out; it was directed to be put in the Sunday’s paper; and that five hundred bills should be pasted up, ‘that they were not levellers—and if their funds were low, Mr. Vaughan said, the Constitutional Society would print for them
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12346 They understood that enemies were getting into the society ; that five divisions tal been scouted, ashe called it (that is, driven from the places where they met)—that -Margarot proposed to write to Mr. Pitt and the attorney general, that if their meetings were illegal, he would be ready to surrender himself, but this was over-ruled; and it was resolved to support all prosecuted members : he said, he wrote this minute at the time. 
EYRE 12347 He was then shown a note, which he says, he received from Hardy; itis in these words —(addressed, Mr. Lynam, No. 31, Walbrooke; dated December the 4th, 1792)— “Citizen Lynam; you are requested to meet the Special Committee this evening, at seven o'clock, at the Nag’s Head, Orange Street, Leicester Fields. Iam, your fellow citizen, homas Harpy. 
EYRE 12348 “Please to inform any of the delegates near you, that you know, but no one else. 
EYRE 12349 This is a circumstance, in some degree, confirmatory of Lynam’s general evideace
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12350 tle says, he went, but he has no memorandum of any thing that passed.—On the eleventh of December lhe was at the division, number twentythree ; it was reported there, that the London Corresponding Societies’ rules had been introduced among thesoldiers.—It wasreported that the Irish had been scouted as we hadbeen, and that they had applied to the council, who had declared their meetings to be legal; that he understood by that, the privy council. —He says, their funds were low, and the divisions were recommended to subscribe to the publication of the Address; three of this division offered to stick the Address up about the town. It was reported, that Baxter, who was a delegate of the division, number sixteen, was at the meeting at Shoreditch church, and that he opposed that meeting, and that he was laid hold of; and in consequence of that, seeing that he could not resist, he threw some of the Societies’ Addresses among the people assembled there; and he complained he was very ill-used, his coat torn, and he was struck several times in the church-yard; he said, it was a meeting to support the constitution. 
EYRE 12351 Upon the thirteenth of December the delelegates inet in Round-court, in the Strand; cighteen persons were present; Hardy was one
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12352 It was reported, that the magistrates were after Littlejohn.—One Field was chosen assistant secretary. —There was a motion from the division, number four, that a letter should be wrote to the Common Council. He says, that Ridgway was to publish Margarot’s letter to Mr. Secretary Dundas: the project was, that this letter was to be written and carried to the post office hy Margarot and two others. —The letter was dated the fourth of December, 1792; and that they might be sure it was sent, they took a receipt from the post office. The letter to Mr. Secretary Dundas was read, recommending areform, and to protect them fom all interruption.—That letter must be read, 
EYRE 12353 Lynam says, his note goes on to state— That division, number one, recommends that it be represented to the public, that confusion may he expected, but that if riots ensue, our societies will aid the magistrates, and that copies shall be sent to the magistrates; but take care that we say, that no disposition appears of committing any riot, and that we will persevere in a parliamentary reform but if prosecuted persons were not found to be rash in words or violence, that it is proper for the society to protect them—he says, I do not know whether any thing was done upon that; there were many things agitated in the committee
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12354 The delegates of the division, number two, Hardy’s division, proposed to brin forward new-shaped cards of admission. letter from Norwich, signed Cosens, was read, Mentioning meetings being held there, as well as in other places, to support the government; and asked whether the London Society had signed to support government.— Margarot proposed, that should not be communicated to the divisions: what the reason for that was, is not clear. There wasa letter, dated the fifteenth, from Paisley, expressin their willingness to correspond with us, an mentioning twelve societies formed in August for a parliamentary reform. There was a letter from Edinburgh, of the eleventh of December, to call a convention of all Scotland, to be of the same opinion, and the title of the Society was—“ The Friends of the People— Archibald East Hodge, president; William Read, secretary. 
EYRE 12355 He says, that division, number thirty-three, mct at Crown Street, upon the eightcenth of December; nothing passed there. Upon the twentieth of December, the delegates met at number thirty-one, Compton Street; Hardy was present; two members were deputed from the Constitutional Whigs to know if the Corresponding Socicty would concur in an Address to the Friends of the People. Division, number twelve, recommended to petition a liament before Mr. Grey brings in his bill for parliamentary reform—Martin recommended not to publish any thing ; that the times would not do; that they cculd not stand against the treasury. Number sixteen moves for the delegates to determine if they should sign the Address at the Crown and Anchor: and this was left to every man’s discretion; that is the address that had been formed there, by another party, in support of government; the question was, whether they should sign that Address; and this was left to every man’s discretion, but to avoid it, if possible. Margarot wrote to Cozens, that we will not sign at any of the meetings. 
EYRE 12356 There is a communication from Norwich, that five guineas had been sent up, in order to have Mr. Fox's speech on a parliamentary reform, sent down to the persons from whom the money came; and they were to publish some hand-bills, to express a determination to persevere. Five hundred copies of Mr. Fox’s speech were sent accordingly. Division number sixteen proposed to give tickets to soldiers, to admit them gratis, if they chose to enter ; but that they shall be warned of their danger: this was not agreed to. Division number twenty-four moved to publish our determination to support the magistrates, and persevere ina parliamentary reform: this was agreed to; and Margarot was desired to draw it up. A petition trom Carter, who was employed to stick bills up; that he lost a place of twelve shillings a week. Martin had been directed to defend him ; and there was a subscription to detray the expense. Ridgway had communicated, that he was ready to publish any thing the society chose to send him. It was observed by Margarot, respecting Mr. Fox, that he had gone as far as could be expected ; but that they were not obliged to him; for he was forced to avow what he had done. Martin reported that Gay had employed Carter to stick up bills; and that he had stuck them up in the morning, instead of the evening, as he was directed; in consequence of which, he was taken up. The next is number thirtyone, Compton-street, a meeting of the delegaics on the twenty-seventh of December. The prisoner was there. Each delegate was to take the sense of his division, on the propriecty of admitting soldiers, aud on what terms. ’ 
EYRE 12357 IIe says, upon the third of January, 1793, there was a meeting of delegates, at number thirty-one, Compton-street; Margarot was chosen president; Hardy, secretary ; Field, sub-secretary. ‘Lhe distresses of one Thompson’s wife were laid before the meeting; he was a member, but had gone away to France ; twelveshillings and sixpence was collected for her. There was a motioncame forward, for a declaration to the public; two divisions objected to it; the declaration was proposed to be published ; the objection was, because the declaration said, rather have a constitution without a king, than a king without a constitution: it was observed, that this would be a thing proper to be said, if they were republicans. Margarot reported that he had received a letter. Notice was given of five delegates from the Roman Catholics in Ireland, who were of the same mind with themselves; and the application was to them, to see whethera communication could be opened with them Hardy was present. 
EYRE 12358 The next is a meeting at the division number twenty-three, January the eighth, m Crown-street, Moorfields. He says, I have got down here, that the declaration—I sy pose the declaration mentioned before—it s the opinion of this division, that it should be rejected ; it was agreed likewise, not to address the king at all. It was said, Mr. Grey would not bring forward his motion fora reform, unless petitions were sent to parliament; agreed to petition parliament by all means, and not to address them. 
EYRE 12359 ‘The nextis a meeting on the tenth of January, 1793, at number thirty-one, Old-Compton-street ; seventeen delegates attended, of whom Hardy was one; the declaration was ordered to lie upon the table ; then it was agreed upon, that no written paper be brought in, but by a delegate, or throug the treasurer or secretary. Margarotreported, that the cous try correspondence did not shine ; there were very few letters; he reported that he had sent a letter to the Friends of the People, at Free Masons’ tavern: the answer was read; that they expected to obtain an effectual re form ; they were desired not to mix fore’ politics with home politics, and to avoid foreign correspondence. It was remarked, that this society, that is, the socicty at Free Masons’ tavern, never brought forward their prin ciples ; and it was determined not to correspond with them. Bell observed, that the address to the National Convention of France, proves that we mean their laws here; to which, according to this minute, Margarot said, no doubt; others said nothing. 
EYRE 12360 That, you see, is the most material of all these papers I have hitherto read to vou; that, in the course of the conversation at this meeting of delegates, respecting their address to the National Convention of France, Bell said, it proved that they meant the French laws should be established here ; to which Margarot said, no doubt; the others said nothing; Hardy was then present. 
EYRE 12361 He says, it was observed, that a plau which had been proposed, of the addition of a hundred members to the House of Commons, will not do; it will give them more advan! and keep us from a proper reform. It was reported that one of the Irish delegates had agreed to correspond. Ata meeting on the 14th of January, at Hardy's, Hardy said, he had dispersed fifty of our addresses, and twelve of Keirsant’s speech. 
EYRE 12362 The nextis a meeting of delegates, on the 17th of January, at number thirty-one, Compton-street. It was reported that nineteen of the divisions were kept up. It was that they were to debate, and consider whether the age of eighteen, or twenty-one, was the proper age for voting for a member of parliament: it was argued, it should be eighteen, because, at that age, they are liable to be militia-men. Division number twelve recommended to consider of a public meeting, to discuss parliamentary reform ; that was referred back again, for further consideration. Number four proposed thanks to the mayor of Glasgow, and to the society of Durham and Dundee, for uniting with the society. There were sixteen delegates present. A petition from Carter was presented, who had reccived sentence for sticking up a bill, supposed to be a libel. A special committee appointed to examine how his defence had been conducted. A motion was made for all the delegates to meet on a Saturday evening, to discuss political subjects. A letter was received from Norwich; the Friends of the People want to propose a mild reformation ; and this society of Norwich want to know whether they are friends. One Hobhouse had formed a society at Bath, and proposed a correspondence. Then it was proposed to correspond with the Norwich Society, through the means of the Bell Society. 
EYRE 12363 He says, on January the 24th, there was a meetingat number thirty-one, in Comptonstreet. Two gentlemen came with a petition from Thompson's wite. Martin thought it should be rejected. There was a conversation about the defence of the bill-sticker, and also an account of what counsel had been applied to, and who did undertake the defence ; there was an anxiety about the manuscript of this bill which had been stuck up, which had got into the hand of Grant. A letter from Richter, that he did not dare attend. The delegate number five is going to France, with some copics of Paine’s works; he had private notice that they would all be taken up. 
EYRE 12364 Upon the 31st of January, Baxter, the deJegate from number sixteen, proposed that, in future, of the quarterage money six-pence should go to the society, and the other sevenpence to go towards the expense of the room ; at was agreed that this might be a very proper measure to be adopted for the poor divisions, but not for the rest. It was remarked, and assented to by all, that, supposing there should be an opposition, and the two parties should come to an open rupture, it would be proper to encourage the two divisions, number sixteen, and number twenty-five, in Spital-fields, because they were very numerous, and it is necessary to keep them together. ‘hese are the divisions before mentioned to be as large as all the other divisions put together. This last remark, he says, he makes from his recollection. Number seven proposed to publish a letter, which had been written by a Mr. Law to Mr. Reeves respecting the business of an association ; but this was rejected; and another publication was proposed. The reply to the answer of the Friends of the People, objects that they were not explicit ; and they want to know how far they mean to go with their design ; and Lynam’s note is, that they were apprehensive of a breach. The general sense of the Friends of the People did not go as faras the London Corresponding Society, or Constitutional Society, who thought that it must come to a struggle : this, he said also was recollection. Margarot said, they were getting on fast again ; a petition is not the mode. Then comes a material passage —but yet, it was agreed a petition should be presented, to keep the public mind ayitated upon the subject of reform. 
EYRE 12365 He says, upon the fitth of February, the division number twenty-three, met in Crownstreet. It was reported, there were sixty friends to the cause, who declined, at present, meeting the society; but they are ood friends, and wish them success; that there were certain religious socicties in the kingdom, whose sentiments led strictly to republicanism ; they were numerous in several of the great towns; naming them; and particularly in London: and that the societies in London were just now beginning to organize themselves agreeably to the principles in France, and that they were to meet on Mondays and Thursdays. It was said that Paine’s works had been published in Sweden. 
EYRE 12366 The next meeting wason the 7th of February, of the delegates, at number eight, Queen-street, Seven Dials. ‘The prisoner, Hardy, wasthere. ‘They were anxious to preserve the divisions, sixteen, and twenty-five, as poor divisions; these were Baxter's divisions; that they would be of great service, if we should go to war; this was an observation of Margarot’s. Many said, it was eventually expected that there would bea rising in the country. A letter, sent to Bath, has been gone fourteen days, and no answer, though two letters have a sent. A Sheftield letter, of the 16th of January, by order of the Constitutional Society, had been conveyed to alk the societies, reljuesting to know how far they mean to go; and all were of one opinion not to petition this year. Hardy was present, and proposed that there should be a delezate from each division of the society, to agree how to proceed. Mr. Fox has observed, in the House of Commons, that the people have aright to alter the government when they please ; the Scotch and the Irish have done it. The London Corresponding Society were first formed to send a delegate to all the other societies, to determine the best way of reform. The Friends of the People, in the Borough, still exist, and were determined to communicate with this, and other societies, and inuire into their intentions.

A letter sent to the Constitutional Whigs at Sheflicld, saying, there will be a conference about this matter, and that they will write to them. Three questions would be proposed for consideration—whether to petition the king—to petition parliament—or to call a convention. It was remarked that it would be well to decline coming to any resolution till the whole nation are agreed. Margarot says, they should neither petition nor remonStrate; it would be unconstitutional. Reported that the Aldgate Society had thanked 
EYRE 12371 Ir. Fox for his speech, saying, that the people might alter the constitution, without giving their reasons. 
EYRE 12372 The next is a meeting of division number twenty-three, held on the 19th of February, in Crown-street. The question was agitated, which was the right age for election, eighteen, or twenty-one; which was put to the vote.

EYRE 12374 On the 21st of February, the delegates met at Compton-street. Godfrey, who had been Tejected and re-chosen, was rejected again, but insisted he would not quit the place; therefore they had no other way of getting rid of him, but by adjourning to Charles -street.

A man pro posed to them, to subscribe to a book against imprisonment for debt; they refused to subscribe; but they agreed they would take ex tracts from it, that were worth publishing.

EYRE 12379 On the 29th of April there was the anniversary dinner of the Constitutional Society, at the Crown and Anchor tavern, lord Sempill in the chair. The witness says they talked very Boldly, and laughed at the fears of the public, and were sure a revolution would take place in this country. Then come the toasts—the Rights of Man—may Despotism be trampled under the hoofs of the Swinish multitude, &c. On the 2nd of May, a delegate mecting, number thirty-one, Compton-street, eleven delegates present, Mr. Fox wrote to Hardy that the petition which had been brought to him went toa radical reform, by which would be understood universal suffrage, which he was not a friend to, but he would present the petition if we desired it; they then desired Mr. Francis to present it; two of the Shettield delegates that brought their petition were made honorary members; Mr. Fox’s note was produced, but nothing turns upon that. 
EYRE 12380 At a meeting on the 16th of May, number seven proposed to draw up a remonstrance against the war. It was said Hardy had received an anonymous letter. 
EYRE 12381 Atameeting on the 23rd of May, twelve delegates present. It was proposed to call a pore meeting; there was a letter from ittlejohn on the 18th of May—proposed to have a committee to prepare an address— notice was taken of Le Brun’s letter to lord Grenville; this might be thought to have come from some communication with France, and they waited to see what notice would be taken of that letter.

EYRE 12382 Upon the 6th of June a public meeting was advertised five for six; thanks were voted to Mr. Wharton for his speech—agreed to be printed, and comments to be made upon it; Margarot to get a thousand copies of Mr. Wharton’s speech. ‘The witness says he ceased to be a delegate from the 15th of June.

EYRE 12385 Then, gentlemen, you heard of an association at Lambeth, to learn the manual exercise; the plan was not matured; these were members of the Corresponding Society, who were desirous of learning the exercise. That memorandum respecting the association at Lambeth is so far material, that it speaks of that association as a thing that had been only then heard of for the first time, and had not originally proceeded from the committee of delegates. 
EYRE 12386 On the 12th of November a division meet. ing, number twenty-three. Read a letter from Norwich approving the convention at Edinburgh; that the finances are very low, and a second subscription is wanted to support the delezates in Scotland. There is a kind of memorandum, or sort of instruction for the delegates; a letter is sent to the delegates requesting them to visit all the societies in Scotland. The witness says, that at first he thought that what was said of the finances related to the Norwich Society; but lookin; again he rather thinks that it relates to his own society; reported that there was to be a second general meeting to he held at Edinburgh, but afterwards it w2s altered and intended to be held at Glasgow: there was a letter read, dated the 8th of November, from Hardy to the delegates in Scotland. 
EYRE 12387 On the 2nd of January, the witness attends again as a delegate; they resolved to remove the committee room to number three, in New Compton-street; that no person who had not belonged three months to the society to be elected a delegate ; agreed to draw up a handbill approving of the conduct of the delegates in Scotland, and censuring the justices; to distribute a thousand in Edinburgh; a letter was read from Sheffield, signed William Broomhead, chairman, recommending them to come to some spirited resolutions to be adopted for the support of the delegates immediately; it was said that at this meeting there were about two thousand. 
EYRE 12388 The next meeting is the 9th of January; he has not got Hardy’s name down at present, but believes he was there ; there was to be a general meeting on the 20th for dinner at the Globe; a sub-committee was appointed for the management of this meeting, the names put down for stewards were, Thelwall, Franklow, Agar, Kydd, Lovett, Hurrison, Stiff, Peacock, Harris, Sinclair, Powel, Williams, Mitchel, Pearce, Moore, Moffatt, Mar«.

EYRE 12390 The witness says he was at the meeting on the 20th of January at the Globe-tavern, Martin was president; when they were assembled the floor gave way; he was there before the business began; they went to a room above stairs, there were Martin, Ramsay, Richter, Thelwall, and Hardy there. The short-hand writer reported Margarot’s trial; an address to the nation was carried, and then they adjourned to dinner, Thelwall was chairman; the witness dined in an adjoining room; the witness came again into the large room soon after he had dined. 
EYRE 12391 There was a meeting of delegates at number three, New Compton-street, on the 23rd of January; the prisoner was there—agreed that hand-bills be stuck up, saying what grievances we wish to redress, The next thing that came forward was a box for the subscription for the support of the delegates in Scotland; it was opened that night, the amount was 13. 4s. 5d. and nine bad shillings; it was pet to publish the names of those who had given evidence against the patriots; this was objected to by Thelwall, as it might produce massacres. It was proposed at that time to choose two sub-delegates to attend the perpetual committee to watch the parliament every night; this proposal was Not carried; it was proposed that the committee should be made perpetual. 
EYRE 12392 Upon the 30th of January, a meeting of delegates, Hardy being present, division number eleven recommended to divide the metropolis into divisions; number thirteen moved to recommend it to those who are not members to subscribe; number eight wished to know if they should remove into the Borough, that press-gangs were about, and they had lost their business ; Thelwall moved to a point a permanent committee of delegates to consider of the measures to be pursued during the present posture of affairs, and to be a secret one; those of the general committee of delegates already chosen to be filled up by other delegates, to be invested with discretionary power to report to the committee of delegates, but the committee of delegates have power to dissolve them when they please; the secret committee were Martin, axter, Williams, Thelwall, and Moore. This secret committee were to consider what measures were to be adopted, and to call a general committee of delegates when they thought proper; a sub-committee of three proposed to consider of raising subscriptions for the delegates in Scotland, referred to the secret committee with full powers; Thelwall peo posed a committee of two as a committee exigence, to report to the general committee, but not to publish any thing—but this was withdrawn ; a letter stated from Bristol from old friends new revived. 
EYRE 12393 On the 6th of February, at a meeting of delegates, Hardy being present, a mobca from the permanent committee to appoint others who are not to be known. The witness’s memorandum is, that as it was dan gerous, they were to be dissolved, 2nd to name others, and their names not to be mentioned. 
EYRE 12394 Gentlemen, this shows you the progres: of this appointment of a committee; it had zone to the appointment of a secret committee, to act in the then posture of affairs; that the secret committee were afterwards dissolved 9 this extraordinary way, but they were to name another secret committee, whose names were Not to be known; so the business was to be conducted by a secret committee, who mizbt probably be the same persons, but could uot be known by any one to be the same persons, and the ground of it is, thatit was thought to be dangerous. What the secret committee were to do is matter of observation upon this extraordinary proceeding. A letter was re ceived in a parcel from Sheffield from Margarot, dated the 11th of January, and a letter was received from Gerrald for a short-hand writer to be sent down to take his trial. 
EYRE 12395 At a meeting on the 20th of February, number eighteen moved to reprint the Rights of Swine; a committee of seven are to revise the new constitution of the society ; resolved that 50,000 hand-bills of lord Stanhope’s speech respecting the foreign troops be priuted, and to return him thanks. After this time the witness says he ceased to be a delegate. He was then asked who and what be was; he describes himself to be an ionmonger, and to be in the commission hne; that he was first among this society by accident at the sign of the Mansion House, where he saw some of the resolutions of the society ; he told the landlord that this appeared to him to be a meeting to overturn the constitution, and advised him not to let them meet there any more, for if he did that he would have his licence taken from him. He says he went into the room and conversed with Watson; he refers to a paper which the landlord sbowed him which was the resolutions and address of the society. , 
EYRE 12396 Upon his cross-examination, he says farther, that he is in the commission line, and has done business -from Birmingham and Sheffield; he says he is now epelying ie business in the East Indialine; he has seven years in this way in a small d however he did a great deal of business lat season; he had a warehouse in Wood-street, he removed from one house in Wood-street to another, and from thence to Walbrook, where he has been ever since; he has not been in theretail way since he left Alexander Shrimpton and Company; that the resolutions and addresses were first published upon the twentyfourth of May 1792; he says that when he was tried for being a spy, there was nothing Particular brought forward against him. In that month, he says, he went into Staffordshire and Yorkshire for some time; that he consulted with a friend, who recommended to him to makea reportot these transactions, and he has done so from time to time; he thinks the first report he made was on the first of} October, 1792; he made his reports to one whom he was certain would communicate those reports toa proper channel, but that Rerson was not a magistrate ; he says he put own every thing he could; that it was his duty to do so, for he was to report to his own division, and he gave the same reports to his division, according to his notes, as he had given into thatchannel by which he meant to make a discovery of all that had passed. 
EYRE 12397 Gentlemen, it has been a fatiguing work to go through these broken accounts of the transactions of the society from this man’s Motes, and the accounts must necessarily be somewhat imperfect; but upon the whole they carry with them very great marks of authenticity; and with respect to those facts which can be clearly collected from them, they scem to be very weightily proved, and I cannot imagine that the evidence of this man is shaken in any particular whatever, from the mere circumstance of a man, otherwise of credit, choosing to give information of proceedings which he conceived to be dangerous to the constitution of the country; to say that thatis to affect his credit, 1s not a thing to be asserted in a court of justice, nor fit to be encouraged by a jury. Wherever men of this description give evidence, and they give their evidence ina way which is fairly open to observation, the circumstance of their coming to give their evidence in this manner will have its weight, but if their evidence in other respects is uniformly consistent and probable, and is not impeached, it is not cnough to say that this man went inte this society on purpose to inform the magistrate of what was passing. It is extremely necessary that should be done; it is the duty of magistrates to watch over the public peace, if any thing material is going forward by which the public peace of the country may be affected; it is the duty of the magistrate to use all proper means to bring these proceed-ings to light, in order that they may be brought to the test of the law; and he would be criminal if he did not use those means. 
EYRE 12398 The next witness is Maclean; he produces a letter found upon Adams, the secretary of the Constitutional Society, dated the thirteenth of October, 1792, from the editor of ; the Patriot at Sheffield, directed to John An-drews, secretary to the Society of the Friends of Universal Peace and the Rights of Man, at Stockport. 
EYRE 12399 This letter, though of a pretty old date, seems to have deserved attention; it shows the extraordinary diligence and attention with which the making prosclytes to this cause, was pursued in that part of the country, as well as in many others. That letter and the answer to it must be read. 
EYRE 12400 Gentlemen, the next witness is John Coates ; he says he is an apprentice to Franklow, who lived at number one, China Walk, Lambeth; he says he was bound apprentice in November last; that Franklow used to be out late of nights; that there used to be exercising with tire arms up stairs twice a week, about eight o’clock in the evening; that Shelmerdine and Williams were two of the persons who used to be there, there were about eight or nine of them; he supposes them to be the same persons, the window shutters were shut; his master used to go to Worcester-street, in the Borough, he does not know what he did there; he says the arms they used at his master’s house were kept on the first floor, he did not know where they were put after his master was apprehended ; he remembers seeing cartouch boxes in the cutting room, they ‘lay upon the board; he once saw his master in regimentals, and that Williams had a uniform, he saw his master in regimentals one Sunday morning in the house. 
EYRE 12401 James Walsh was at Chalk-farm when Richter read the resolutions; he heard the word convention mentioned by him, and that they had formed a correspondence with different societies in different towns; that was all he could speak to, except that two hundred thousand copiesof the resolutions were to printed; and he says that Thelwall spoke very violently. 
EYRE 12402 Thomas Green was the next witness; he says he isa perfumer, that he also deals in knives and cutlery ware; he says it is customary for perfumers to deal in such articles ; he says he had knives with a catch in the back, he had three dozen of them from Sheffield, packed in small parcels, he sold fourteen of them, he can name three or four persons who bought single knives, one was the prisoner at the bar, and that he sent him six others ina package; that he was to make choice of one, and if he could dispose of the rest he might; he did not book them, and four of them were returned after Hardy was apprehended, he had not called on him before ; he said he sold one to one Mr. Billington, and one to Groves; he had them from Scotheld and Company, at Sheftield; that he had dealt with another person in Sheffield; they have riders; one happened to bring patterns of this kind of knife, which before he had seen in shops in the Strand, and other places, and so he ordered a parcel; he says ho docs not know how Hardy came to know that he had them; he says that in Compton-street he ate his supper with one of these knives,Pearce had another which was rather better Gnished, and which he had not bought of the witness. 
EYRE 12403 Upon his cruss-exanination, he says he used such a kuife as this seven years ago ; that he has tweuty of the three dozen he bought left now; most cutler’s shops have them ; that he sold them in the common ! 
EYRE 12404 course of his trade. As to Groves, he says he came to purchase a knife, and he remarked the utility of the knife; he did not tell Groves that he had suld two or three hundred of them, but Groves asked him if le had sold many, he told him yes, he not liking to discourage the sale of his own goods; he says he did not desire Groves to speak low, because the parlour door was open, and his wife was a damned aristocrat, he did not use such ao expression; he did nut desire Groves to speak low; that the knives lay openly in the glass case for sale; he says he did not keep them to scll to mischievous people, and he does not recollect saying a word about his wife, or using the word aristocrat, and that he never wished to conceal from his wife that he sold these knives. 
EYRE 12405 Now here, undoubtedly, there is a flat contradiction between him and Groves; they are both witnesses called on the part of the crown; they certainly put you under a dilemma, and make it difficult for you to be satisfied that Groves is a person who is entitled to credit for what he has said; at the same time though Groves is contradicted in this particular by this witness, he is contradicted in no other particular where witnesses might have been called to contradict him, that is a circumstance for your consideration, upon j : , i members the fact of their dispersion—he says which you will exercise your judgment, I am not not at all pressing you to incline to give more credit to a witness who has been contenor of his evidence upon the whole entitles him to. The next witness, is Edward Hodson, a printer; he declined answering whether he ‘ 
EYRE 12406 printed a particular paper which was shown to him, but he admits that one Hodgson applicd to him to print it, and brought the manuscript. It is a hand-bill respecting the Ins and Outs, that we are in danger from the French, and from the Hessians and Hanoverians, in cither case we should get arms, and learn how to use them—you recollect the paver, -He says, that from all he observed, has no reason to suppose that they had any thing but areform ot parliament in view, that it was no part of their plan to attack the king, he never heard any such thing, or to displace the Lords—he would not-have continued a moment longer in ihe society, if he had supposed any such thing. He says, that upon Hardy and Adams being taken up, and reports being in circulation, ES A A ET 
EYRE 12407 “ See p. 837. 
EYRE 12408 that under pretence of reform, they bad other objects in view, he left them—be sis he understuod the Convention was a th sz not determined upon—that they were to take the advice of the societies in the country, whether they were to assemble a conven —he says there was no idea of their makmng laws, or introducing the anarchy of Frauce into England—he became a member im the month of February—he says he has read printed copy of the resolutions at Chalk-tarm, e has seen a printed copy of the pirceedings on the twentieth of January; he DO thing of their having any thing to d with the works of Paine—that several peorie applied to him to priat the proceedinz at 
EYRE 12409 ; Chalk-farm. 
EYRE 12410 The next witness, is George Ross, of Ecmburgh; he says he became a member of the Society of the Friends of the People in Ed:0burgh, about the end of the year 1793 ; that he was a member of the British Conventwa; he says he made a mistake at first, as to the year, it was in 1792, thathe was made a member; that at the end of November, the beginning of December, 1793, the delegates from other socicties in Scotland attended, and some from England; he says he re ceived some letters from one Stock, in Edm burgh, who was a member of another socet: of the same nature; he says he sent several of thenrinto the country; onetoa 0 of the name of Miller, at Perth, which is now produced; he sent one to Strathaven, and one to Paisley; he is not certain whether be sent one to Dundee; he cannot be certain whether he was present at the vote of unto that they came to in the Convention, whes they extended their hands; he says he reis the the circular letter produced which was sent by him, to diffarent parts of tradicted in one particular, than the whole Scotland. 
EYRE 12411 Upon his cross-examination he says, that his only object was, a reform in the House of Commons, he never thought there was an intention to attack the king’s person, or his prerogatives; they did not at all consider themselves as the parliament of Great Ba tain, but they meant to consider of proper means of petitioning; he says he perceived nothing of any other intent; nothing was said against the king, that he heard; he says it would have been foolish enough to attempt to make laws to bind the people—he says the British Convention consisted of about two hundred persons—they had no arms to at tack the magistrates ; there was no prepara tion of the means for resistance : he said they had nothing illega] in their thoughts ; if they had thought it illegal, they would not have done it, or if they hal thought it dangerous to the king, they would not have done it He says the Convention consisted of le of all ranks, smpstly people of good character, people of sober lives and good morals; says he does not recollect being present ata patculer resolution inquired after; he says, thinks he was present when the resolution was come to about the Habeas Corpus Act, to meet at a place to be appointed by thesecret committee. He says, Downie was a member of the society; he understood theConvention of Emergency to be called to pe- , tition parliament; that he would not have agreed te a convention upon any other terms; that he understood they were to specify a particular refurm in their petition. 
EYRE 12412 Arthur McEwan says, he lives at the Water of Leith, he remembers the dispersion ef the ; convention by the magistrates; that a large committee of union met in consequence of it, of which Watt was a member; there was another committee, a sub-committee, called a committee of Ways and Means; that Stock, Bourke, Aitcheson, Bonthron, Downie, Watt, and hiinself, were of that coinmittee, to look into the affairs of Skirving ; he never saw theletter inquired after. 
EYRE 12413 He says, that Watt read to them a plan to seize the lord justice Clerk, and the rest ofthe lords of council and session, and the lordprovost of Edinburgh; to kindle a fire at the ; Excise-office, in the New Town, and that par-ties should be stationed in the street, to intercept the soldiersas they came down from ! the castle; the fire was todraw the military from the castle; coming down to a point, ; they were to be inclosed by two parties; that different parties were to seize the banking houses in Edinburgh, and commissionerswere to be appointed to demand the cash , from the banks; he did not know who were to execute this, only the sub-committee were j present when this was disclosed ; the witnesssaid, he objected to all this, he would not! agree to any thing that should disturb the peace, or shed the blood of his countrymen; that Bonthron agreed with him, and no farther communication was made at that time. He says, atanother meeting Watt produced a copy of a proclamation, prohibiting the removal of corn, grain, hay, and meal; that persons were not to remove the same from ! their respective places of abode; there was a copy of an address to the king, ordering himto dismiss his present ministers, and to putanend to this bloody war, or else he might expect bad consequences to ensue—this was to be sent to the king, on the morning afterthe attack. The witness said, these things did not belong to the cause of a reform, andhe would have nothing to do with it. 
EYRE 12414 He says, he went with Watt, to Robert ; Orrock’s, to bespeak pikes; Orrock sketched out one, Watt said, he had four thousand to send to Perth, besides what he had to distribute about Edinburgh; Stock was of the committee, he said he was going to London, or Bristol, and would wait on Hardy by the desire of Watt, who proposed to send a [etter to Hardy; Stock undertook to take this letpondence was to be conducted, something wag to signify, that the aristocrats were doing so and so, and the democrats so and so; Stock was to call again upon Watt; the witness saw him no more, 
EYRE 12415 Upon his cross-examination he says, that parliamentary reform was the object of the society; that the society to which he belonged, consisted of about twenty; that he attended the convention about half, a dozen: 
EYRE 12416 nights ; that they meant to obtain a parliamentary retorm, by a petition, and that it was to have come under consideration, the night they were dispersed. You see there was a scroll of a petition brought forward, and & negative put upon it, in a certain way, by calling for the order of the day; but in that story of his he must be mistaken; he says it was to come under consideration the night of the dispersion; that there were near two hundred members; that they had no arms he never heard of an intention to use force ; that the rctorm most of them spoke of, was universal suffrage, and annual parliaments, and some were for triennial parliaments; he says, there was nothing said, touching the King, or the Lords; he cannot undertake to say, what that committee of union was for, he did not hear that it was for the purpose of establishing a new convention ; he says Skirving’s letter was read at a meeting, and a sube committee appointed. He says, he heard the delegates were to lave another convention, of the time, and place of meeting of which, they were to get information ; he could not say as to the purposes of the new convention. 
EYRE 12417 William Middleton says, he searched the’ house of Watt, on the fifteenth of May, but nothing turns upon that. 
EYRE 12418 Gentlemen, this was the evidence they gave of a conspiracy breaking out in Scotland, after the dispersion of the cunvention, which it is insisted upon by the attorney general, makes a part of this general plan, in this country; that by possibility, Hardy's circular letter, or some other of Hardy’s publications, or the publication of the Sheffield committee, or of the Constitutional Society might have excited this, is certainly true, and therefore the evidence could not be rejected ; but as to the bringing home to the prisoner, Hardy, that he was implicated directly in this conspiracy, the evidence docs not appear to me to go that length, for all the conversation ahout a letter to be carried by Stock to Hardy, comes to nothing, for Stock never did deliver that letter; Muargarot and Gerrald,. who were delegates with Hardy’s participation from the Corresponding Society, do not appear to have been involved in this conspiracy—they were, I believe, in custody at the time, and upon the whole, therefore, that does rather seem to have been something that broke out in consequence of the general irritationwhich had been so improperly produced by ter. Stock took a slip of paper, and gavethe pains that had been taken throughout the him some token by which this same corres-country to irritate it; but I do not see any thing that makes it probable, that Hardy, personally, was concerned in this part of the conspiracy, or that he knew any thiag at all about it. 
EYRE 12419 Gentlemen, the next witness, Schaw, produces a paper, found upon Thelwall, and Nost produces a paper, fount! upon Martin; these two papers are proved to have been Martin’s hasdaecliivng they were found after Hardy’s apprehension; but they become evidence even in this ease, against Hardy, from the eircumstance of their having been proved, by two witnesses, to have been in Martin's possession, before Hardy was apprehended ; they were, therefore, papers that existed before that time. 
EYRE 12420 Now this paper purports to be projected fesolutions for the meeting at Chalk-farm ; they differ essentially from the resolutions that were agreed to, and appear to be of a more direct and violent east than those resolutions were, because they point immediately to the person of the king; it will be proper that you should hear that paper now’read, 
EYRE 12421 ‘ Gentlemen, what is conveyed by that last rosolution? That itis the bounden duty of the people to punish all traitors against the nation, and that the following words are now not a part of the oath of allegiance—‘ That it is not lawful to take arms against the king ; a more dangerous and more treasonable paer, one has hardly ever scen: of this paper have to remark, that there is no evidence which directly brings it home o the prisoner, Hardy, but the evidence stands thus—This has been manifestly a draught of a resolution which, in the mind of the drawer, was intended for a meeting of the London Corresding Society, about that time ; the date to 
EYRE 12422 Wt is the fourteenth of April; upon that fourteenth of April the Chalk-farm resolutions were proposed; the paper was found upon Thelwall, who was present at the Chalk-farm Meeting, aud taking an active part there; suoh a paper, therefore, found upon Thelwall and Martin, two members of this society, seems bubtco manifestly to prove what the ideas were that were floating in the minds of these people, at the time of those resolutions; and they certainly show, that very dangerous designs were coneeived by some of those people, to be brought forward, at that time, In some shape er other: how it was settled— in what consultation—by what persons—there is no direct evidence; that you can only gaess at; they are persens that usually transacted the business for this Corresponding Society; you know who they were; Hardy was a principal one
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12423 Whether that is sufficient to convince you, that he had any thing to do with it, or whether you have reason to think, that, bad as it is, it has nothing to do with ang body, but these upen whom it was found, that is matter fer your consideration; but it certainly shows, that, in the minds of 
EYRE 12424 (iss these persons, there was danger, of the ma alarming degree: of violence, that one as hardly ventute to contemplates it leads to: Gegree of wickedness, that one could Hardy suppose to be possible
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12425 With this evideaa the case on the part of the prosecution closes, and now I have to read to you, therefore, the evidence on the part of the prisoner. 
EYRE 12426 The first witness is Florimond Geddy; he says, he is 2 member of the London Caresponding Society; he was of the same & vision as Hardy, number two; he says, bextended very regularly; he dves net keor that he missed ange for two years; hess. that he ceased to be a member when Hatr was taken us that Hardy was very nny absent; that he was perfectly well acquaint with him; that he hardly ever miss i upon him on a Sunday; that he wasar markably peaceable man ; a friend to orde: that when the meetings were dis , Har desired that they would not even sign with them ; that his object was a pari tary reform in the House of Commons, ai that it was no part of his view ta make ay alteration in the House of Lords ; that be meant nothing agamst the Crown; God fu bid that he should; that there were frequat conversations upon political subjects, whid he had with Hardy ; that curiosity induced him to ask a number of questions, and Never supposed the prisoner had any views different from his; he says, he never heard ci the letter trom Sheffield about pikes; that hs brother introduced hjm ; he was at the Globe tavern; and at Chalk-farm; that every thiog was very peaceable; that there were soxe resolutions in print, and that the paper co tained a cprrect account of what passed; be thought that all that was transacted, at bob places, was agreeable to the law of the land. 
EYRE 12427 He says, it is true, that the society sent de legates to the Scotch Convention; that bisself was notin office; he has heard ofa secret committee ; he never heard who thcy were; he ducs not think that the body knew who the secret committee were ; he knew nothing of their proceedings, and he did not choose 1 attend after Hardy was taken up
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12428 te sas, Margarot and Gerrald were their delegates; he may have seen the address of the sisth of August, 1792; he heard of a circular letter, which was sent to Scotland to call a convestion; he does not know how it got there, but he heard of it at his division, that this was call a convention: he says, that the proce ings at the Globe Tavern, on the twentieth of} anuary, and the proceedings at Chalk Farm, were peaceable and consti ; that there might be songs after dinner, bat ey were not in general introdaced ; he 93 he has heard the song, “ God save the Rights of Man ; he has heatd of the song“ Plant, plant the Tree, but never heard itsug; says, a man used to attend the society, mths pack of idle songs; he says, he had Thelwail's songs; he ‘thought ttiere was pp ham in them; there was one very long one; he eanneot recollect the title of its three of these songs were printed in one sheet of paper; he eaanot recollect the title of them. 
EYRE 12429 The only observation that occurs to me, upon this man’s evidence is, the distance at which he seems to have been kept from all knowledge of what was doing; there was a secret committee, which seem to have managed all the material concerns of the society; end it is remarkable, that this person whe was connected with Hardy, did noteven know ery thing with regard to the cireumstance of the pikes; whetier Hardy’s not communicattug it happened mercly by accident, which I think most probable, or whether there was any reason tor not letting this man into the business of the pikes, is a goed deal uncertain, wpon this state of the evidence; but, if other people were let into it, why this man was not as not easy to see. 
EYRE 12430 Francis Dowling says, he was a member of this suciety, and belonged to Hardy’s division; their only object was, a reform in the House of Commons; they had no thoughts against the King or the House of Lords; they had no idea of opposing the government by force. The object of the convention, he says, was, to the sense of the delevates, from different ivisions, to obtain a reform in the House of Commons, and that there was no intention of proceeding by feree in any meraler of the society ; he says, that he was two years and a half ia the division, and never saw or heard of a letter, from Sheftield, about pikes; he was a member of this society from the commencement ef it: he says, be dined at the Crown and Anchor, on the second of May; there was some music, buthe dees not know what it was. He says, he was at Chalk Farm; he saw the resolutions at the Globe-tavern, but lee does not recollect what they were; he was once delegate, tor six months; he ceased to be se, five or six months ago. 
EYRE 12431 He says, he knew Speuce’s shop ; he bought pamphicts there; he has scen Franklow there, but never heard of any exercising there, till he heard of it now ; hesays, he hus heard of a committee of correspondence; if there was one, it was voted by ballot; he knows Hodgson the hatter; he knows nothing of any seeret committee being appointed, after the apprehension of Hardy; that he has never been in Academy-court, Chancery-lane; he never heard of the Shefield letter, till he saw it in the report ef the secret committee; he never heard of the order to stick the bills up in the aight; Carter, who stuck up the bills, received the money ; whether the bill was criminal he eapnet tell; he did not hear all the conof ae resolutions ; the fee conduct ie people, he says, at Cha ‘arm was pasiestic, then, he ony he voted for the resokstions, without hearing them distinctly, but that others attended to them; that he eted because ethers did; that is a way in: which the majority in these essemblics, I aare say, was very often obtained. f 
EYRE 12432 Alexander Wills edys, he was between two atid three years a member of the Correspond-. ing Society; he says, the object of the society was a parliamentary reform in the House of Commons ; that they were full of respect, honour, and fidelity, to the king; he never had reason to think others intended otherwise ; never to his knowledge, was it intended to do any thing by force; thathe would! not have continued in the society, if there had been eny istention of doing any thing by force ; he has not been 8 member of the society since the king of France suffered ; that the prisoner is of an amiable charaeter, and a good member of society. 
EYRE 12433 The witness says, he id 2 dancing-master ; he is also a member of the Constitutional 80ciety; he was introduced by Heleroft, after he became a member of the Constitutional Societys he wished to hear speakers that were clever men; he took his rule of polities from news-pepers, from public report, and from debates in both Houses of Parliament ; he was but little acquainted with the proceedings; he did not see the books at the meetings; he never knew any of their transactions, which might bring the people or those they ethployed, into any difficulties; he may, he says, have given a shilling, or five shillings, a guinea, two guineas, or five guineas, te assist Carter ; he says, he often gives five guineas, and he does not know whom he gives it to; then, when pressed a little, he says, he might have given some shillings, if not guineas; at last he said, he did not give guineas, but he did give a few shillings; he says, he was asked, in one of the societies, to contribute, in Compton-street ; he says, he is not sure he gave more thaa that. He never heard of a seeret committee, or committee of correspondence, and never saw any letter that been written to the prisoner. I think, notwithstanding that strange Hourish of his, about the five guineas, one may sately conclude that there was no harm in this wite ness. 
EYRE 12434 Archibald Hunter was a member of the London Corresponding Society about twenty months; he knows the prisoner; he belonged to the same division with Hardy ; he says, the object of the society was, to obtain a parliamentary reform; he never understuod any thing else but a reform in the Commons House of Parliament; the King, and the House of Lords, to remain as they were; he 
EYRE 12435 Never heard of force out of the Report; he says, there was no intention to atlack the vernment of the country; that Hardy was a peaceable, respectable, quiet man; he says, Hardy never produced any letter at the divie sien, about pikes, nor communicated it, to his knowledge; he continued a member of the society; he was introduced by Joseph Hupter; be did not attend very regularly, being ae ea out ef town.

EYRE 12445 They then call Mr. King, and the purpose for which they call Mr. King was, to show, that a letter, which was enclosed to Hardy, in Davison’s letter, which Davison’s letter, you recollect, propused to Hardy a plan for furnishing the society, or any one that wanted them, with pikes, from Sheflicld; in that letter, a letter to a society at Norwich was sent enclosed; Mr. King is not able to speak exactly to it, but he says, he does recollect the circumstance of a letter being found, unopened at the time, but he cannot take upon him to say, whether that was the Norwich letter or no. David Martin, of Sheffield, says, he is a member of a society there, for a reform in the Commons House of parliament, by legal and constitutional means; he says, that-he had no reason to believe that the object of ’ -any other person, was different from his; . he e has been a mem- !

UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12447 He says, he was not in the secret, that the motion for a petition to parliament, which Broomhead made at the Sheffield meeting, was made to be negatived; he says, whatever Mr. Brown might write or think, or whatever he migit do, the society gave him no authority to act for them at Edinburgh, except in a legal, and constitutional manner : he admits that he had read Yorke’s speech. Edward Oakes, a plater at Sheffield, says, he has been a member of the society, from 1791 to the present time; he says, he attended the meeting, that his object was, to procure, by lawful and constitutional means, in co-operation with the rest of the societies, a reform in parliament; they expected their petitions would be heard, when made by large bodies, that it would be more likely to impress the parliament; that it was never their object to use force; he says, he would not have remained in the society if that had been their object; they had no object, but a reform in the House of Commons, and that by petition. He says, he was upon the Castle-hill, that he dues not know the terms of the resolution; he was in the society when a delegate was sent to Scotland, he does not recolTect whether the proposition came from Scotland, or from themselves; he says, the object was, to have proper measures considered of, to obtain a parliamentary reform; he says, Brown was to express the sense of their society; they were to point out the proper way of addressing parliament, which might. not de altogether thought of by them, these pereons appeared to ii to be more capable of judging; he thought petitioning from so tee a body would have weight with parliament; they had nothing in contemplation against the king, his title, office, or life; he says he does not particularly recollect whether apy thing was said about the House of Lords; he does not believe the object of the society extended farther than the representation of the people in the House of Commons. 
EYRE 12448 He says, he remembers hearing about pikes, that their society had great apprehensions of danger from the opposite party, that they had been threatened and ill used by the opposite party, and by individuals, who took upon themselves an authority that they had no right tu; this was complained of in the society ; he says, that it never was designed or agitated to arm, as a body, to attack the vernment; if it had been, he should we known it
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12449 He says, he was a member of the committee ; he does not know that there were any of their members in any ways associated with the Corresponding Society, any farther than by correspondence ; he did not constantly attend the committee, and the committee did not regularly enter their proceedings ; they were kept by William Broomhead ; he says he knows Samuel Ashton; that he corresponded with the society in London, tor their society; he has seen Ashton write, but he did not attend to his writing ; he says that the letters that were sent were not altogether known to the society at large; the body trusted to the committee ; that the committee sometimes reported, but had no fixed time for doing it; he says, Paine’s Rights of Man had been introduced into the society, hefore they were declared to be a libel; he does not know whether a letter of the 14th of March, to Adams, was sent; he speaks of writing to Mr. Horne Tooke, and to the ConStitutional Society ; two letters were read ; one of them was enclosed to Hardy, in answer to a letter from him, to know what it was they were doing; the other was a letter, of the same date, found upon Adams. 
EYRE 12450 The witness admitted the letters to be Ashton’s hand-writing, and signed by him ; it says they were resolved to obtain a. radical zeferm of the country, as soon as prudence nd discretion weill Pormutt 3 and they request that the villages and towns may unite in the sentiments expressed by Paine. The witness says, he never read that letter at all; he does not know that it was ever communicated to him ; he does net know whether it might be communicated to the eocicty, because he did Rot attead all their meetings ; he says there is the Register and the Patriot, published weekly in Sheflicld—He is shown some printed resolutions, thanking Paine for his two:

EYRE 12460 Upon his cross-examination he says, the object was, all along, to obtain a reform by petition; that that was negatived on the Castlehill, he heard no voice in the affirmative; he says he remained a member of the society, after that; he has some recollection of a vote of approbation of the proceedings of the Scotch Convention, but he was not then present; he says, he did not know of the contrivance to have the vote for the petition negatived, neither from Broomhead nor Camage, and he has had correspondence with Broomhead for fifteen years; he says, he did not know that any petition to his majesty was prepared ; he says he can form no belief as to the hand-writing of Ashton. ‘

EYRE 12462 Upon his cross-examination, he says, that he thought it necessary to provide arms for his own defence; he does not know how many did; he says, as to himself, he made ho application to any magistrate, he says it jvas put into the Register, a public newspaper at Sheffield, that they advised people to arm to assist the magistrates, the advice was to istols into their houses; that invasion, that being the substance of the hand-bill, which they understood to be against them, they adopted similar words; he says, that by equal representation, he means that every man was to have his vote; he had read both editions of the Rights of Man by Mr. Paine; he obtained them bya subscription of a few friends; that there were many that had them; that they thought well of them; that they seldom read them at the society, but they read them at their own houses ; they also had other cheap publications; he says, he was not at the meeting when they approved of Paine’s works; that he never took into consideration Paine’s notions of monarchy; that the society did not adopt that, but they made no protest against it; that they did not wish to destroy monarchy; he understood the author to be expressing disaffection; he says, he knew Yorke at Shefficld, he was at the Castle-hill, they voted by holding up hands; he never heard of the address from the society to France. 
EYRE 12463 His grace the duke of Richmond is then called, in order to identify a paper which is represented to be his grace’s plan for a reform of parliament; he could not identify that paper, but produced a paper purporting to be a letter to a colonel Sharman, containing a plan fora reform of parliament, and that letter was read. ‘The plan was for universal suffrage and annual election, and it stated that the remedy—that the “nf to obtain it would be by the people : he did not expressly name a convention of the people, but, however, he certainly said enough to put that expedient into the heads of those who were eager for such a plan. 
EYRE 12464 Mr. Stuart is then called again; he says, that he has heard Hardy state his plan to be universal suffrage and annual parliaments ; the witness always objected to it, but that was Hardy's opinion, he always adhered to the duke of Richmond's plan—he said, that was the whole object of his society; he was once in company with him at supper, he found him a sincere, simple, honest man; he says he did not know that he had been an associated member of the Constitutional Society. 
EYRE 12465 Mr. Sterling produced the minutes of 3 Scotch borough convention, but they could not be read. 
EYRE 12466 Joseph Strutt of Derby, says, he belonged to a society there; that a reform in the Commons House of Parliament was their object, they had no design against the King, or the House of Lords, and they had no intention te bring about that reform by force; that upon their petition being rejected, their society never met again. 
EYRE 12467 Mr. Sheridan was then called; he says, ke once saw the prisoner, that it was in the b ginning of March, 1793; be had given notice of an intention to bring forward an inquiry in atm against domestic enemies and forei arliament into the cause of the alarms at 5 gn? 
EYRE 12468 that time ; -that upon that occasion he sent to Hardy, who, he understood, could give him information; he came to him, and he conversed with him; Hardy stated his whole object to be obtainin, reform on the duke of Richmond’s plan, and that he was reddy to give him a sight of his whole correspondence, to produce all his papers to him, that he might lay them before parliament in any manner that he should think fit; he was asked whether he was or not an original member of the Constitutional Society, he said he was, but he had not attended since 1783; there were some questions whether Mr. Sheridan had said any thing of books, as well as papers, whether Hardy offered him books as well as papers; afterwards he said he could not take upon him to be sure that Hardy mentioned books ; that his offer was, to put him in possession of all the papers. 
EYRE 12469 r. Francis was then called; he saw Mr. Hardy twice, firstat his own house, and afterwards at Mr. Francis’s house; the Corresponding Society had thanked Mr. Francis for a speech he had made in parliament in the year 1793, and had expressed a desire that it should be printed ; upon that occasion he saw Mr. Hardy: he says, before that time Hardy had been sent to hi. to desire him to present a potition on the subject of a reform in parliament; that they wished their delegates might be admitted to come to his house, accordingly they were admitted, and they brought a petition—there were four of them; he told them he objected to the prayer of their petition, which was for universal representation according to the duke of Richmond’s plan; he says, that Hardy seemed a remarkably reasonable, quiet man; that they were very ready at the argument in support of universal suffrage, they said they only followed the opinions of the duke of Richmond ; he says, he told them they should have left the remedy in general terms to the wisdom of the house; they said they were sorry they had not known that sooner, but that now they could not alter it, as the petition was signed by a great number of people, and must be presented that day, because Mr. Grey was that day to make his motion. 
EYRE 12470 Mr. Francis says, they did not declare that they would accept nothing else, but they appeared to him to adhere to universal representation, There isa little puzzle about a letter which had been written to Mr. Francis, and his answer ; they had in that letter thanked him for what he had said about a radical reform on a broad basis; he says that was not exactly the tenor of his speech, but he did not think it right to enter into rnuch altercation upon the subject, he gave them a civil answer, and there it ended.

EYRE 12473 The Earl of Lauderdale-says, he receiveds letter from the Society of the Friends s the People at Portsburg, near Edinburgh; that he saw Skirving upon that occas, and he supposes the application was mx to him in consequence of a conversatxa with Skirving ; Skirving represented that ther wished to have men of education, that thes might be prevented from falling into absrditics, which they should otherwise be lable to fall into; he says, he had no reason ta suspect that any thing more was meant than to obtain Universal Suffrage and Annual Parliaments; he heard nothing of force, and has No reason to think there was any intertwa of force. He was asked if he had beard wy thing of Skirving’s letter to Hardy in Jak, 1793, which is a remarkable letter, his lord ship says he had not; this, I think, is the evidence on the part of the defendant. 
EYRE 12474 Gentlemen, I would, if the day were not s far spent, and my own strength too much ehausted, now go on and finish what I haves say upon this subject, but I foresee it mast necessarily run into an inconvenient length, both to myself and to you; and, therefore, 1 believe I must trouble you to attend to-morrow morning, and then I shall hope in a tew hous to release you. 
EYRE 12475 Gentlemen of the Jury ; Last night, at a late hour, I finished the summing up of the parol evidence, and some parts of the written evidence, which seemed to be more immediately connected with the parol evidence on both sides, except that I aid not state to you the protest in the House of Lords, which was read to you, by the consent of the attorney general, on the part of the prisoner. I did not state it to you at that time, because it did not appear to me to be in its mature evidence. It is something that has passed in the Parliamentary History of this country, from whence arguments might be drawn, on the part of the prisoner, to evidence the purity honesty of bis intentions, and, in my judgment, it is in thet lew nay that itcan be made use of in hs ehalf. 
EYRE 12476 Having thus finished the summing up of the evidence, I may say to you, that this cause, this great and momentous caus be tween the king and the prisoner at the bar, is at length brought to the point of conclusion; and it must be a satisfaction to the mind of every honest man that this cause has been so conducted, has been proceeded upon, and has been attended to by you with so much patience and temper, that there is reason to expect that your minds have been sufficiently intourmed on the subject to enable you to discover its true merits, and to pronounce a verdict, which in the first place will be satisfactory to your own consciences, and as such, cannot but be satisfactory lo the cominunity. 
EYRE 12477 Gentlemen, it is as great a satisfaction to me, as I can feel in the exercise of so paintul aduty as that which has been cast upon me, to reflect that upon this occasion there is, I think, no possible chance of our being entangled in any difficulties in point of law. The verdict in this case, will not proceed, and ou will receive no directions from me that it ought to proceed, on any narrow or technical rounds. The overt-act charged in this indictment, is in substance, that the prisoner at the bar, and those who have been concerned with him, have cunspired to depose the king, and to subvert the monarchy of this country; and this is charged, and always has been considered, as an overt-act of the treason of compassing the death of the king. Itis indeed a known presumption of law, acknowledged by the best writers upon the law, and particularly by every one of those writers who have been referred to by the counsel on both sides, that he who conspires to depose the king, compasses and imagines the death of the king; and it never has been made a question, whether the compassing and imagining the death of the king was the primary intent conceived in the mind, and was prior to the conspiracy to depose him, or whether the conspiracy to depose the king, must necessaily, from the nature of the charge, be subsea to the compassing and imagining the eath of the king; I say it isnot to be put to you that the compassing and imagining the death of the king is to be proved a conception in the mind, prior to the conception of deposing the king. The conspiracy to depose the king is evidence of compassing and imagining the death of the king, conclusive in its Nature, so conclusive that it is beconte a presumption of law, which is in truth nothing more than a necessary and violent presumption of fact, admitting of no contradiction. Who can doubt that the natural person of the king is immediately attacked and attempted by him who attempts to depose him. 
EYRE 12478 Gentlemen, I shall employ no more time in discussing such a question; many, many hours were spent at the bar, in this discussion; but, on the part of the prisoner, it was manifest, that, after the discussion, the argument broke down under the case, and it became impossible. for either of the gentlemen to set himself distinctly to maintain this proposition, that an honest man could fairly doubt whether he who conspires to depose the king, has compassed or imagined his death. 
EYRE 12479 Gentlemen, you will therefore proceed to the examination of the fact, and I am most cordially disposed to agree with the counsel for the prisoner, that, if he is this day to be convicted, he ought to be proveablement attaint; i e. the proof ought to be clear and convincing. I avoid using the word direct, lest I should entangle you in a difficulty, as to the nature of the proof; it may consist of a train of circumstances, provided the result is such as shall leave no doubt in your minds. The law of the land is perfectly clear, that such proof is as legal, and therefore ought to be as satisfactory, as the most positive and direct proof that can be offered 
EYRE 12480 Gentlemen, the question of fact may be shortly stated thus : Whether the prisoner, and the other persons, have conspired to subvert the monarchy, and whether they have set on foot a project of a convention of the people, in order to effect it? 
EYRE 12481 Gentlemen, I have employed a part of that time since the Court broke up, which it was necessary enough for me to have devoted to sleep, in endeavouring to take such a review of the evidence in this cause, as might enable me to lay the questions of fact between the king, and the prisoner at the bar, with some tolerable distinctness, before you, that you might see where the matter hinged, and that you might be the better enabled to apply your attention and consideration to the different points of the case. I do not know whether I shall succeed, or not, but I do hope I shall be able tw point out to you the leading features of this case, in a way that may be of some use to you in forming your judgment. 
EYRE 12482 I begin with stating to you, that I think it ought to be conceded to this prisoner, upon the whole result of this evidence, that he had set out originally upon that which is called the Duke of Richmond's Plan of a Reform in Parliament; that is, upon a plan to obtaina representation of the people in the Commons House of Parliament, by Universal Suftrag and Annual Election; and I think it will incumbent on those who sustain the prose cution, to satisfy you that the prisoner, and the other persons who have been concerned with him, whether irritated by their own enthusiasm, or by the example of France, have departed trom that plan, and have entered into a criminal pursuit of another object, another object, in the opinion of very wise men, not very far removed from that which was originally their object (and it is that proximity which has made a laboured promulgation of this doctrine of universal suffrage and annual election, so dangerous to the community); the objectImean to point out to you, is, the substituting, in the room of an improvement of the representation in the Commons House of Parliament, the establishment of a government by a representation of the people only 3.a pure democracy, which may undoubtedly be comprehended under the Lords, “ a fulland free Representation of the People. 
EYRE 12483 Gentlemen, in the mass of the written evidence which has been laid before you, there are to be found passages, and those not extremely numerous, which will be fit to be submitted to your consideration, as grounds from whence the prosecutors have drawn their conclusion, and by which they are to support it; that this departure from the original plan has taken place, and that the prisoner at the bar has entered into the criminal pursuit imputed to him; the passages in the evidence to which I particularly refer you, are those, in the first place, which mark the conduct of the popular societies, in which the prisoner is implicated, in the course of the year 1792, prior to their presenting their addresses to the National Convention of France: when you have considered this evidence, you will have then to consider those addresses to the National Convention, with the circumstances belonging to them. After you have seen and considered those addresses, you will then have to look at their subsequent conduct, to be collected from their written transactions, down to the time of the dispersion of the British Convention, in Scotland, in the latter end of the year 1793; and then you will have to consider, and to form your judgment upon that project of a Convention, which was tonceived and proceeded upon, to a certain extent, in the beginning of 1794. 
EYRE 12484 Gentlemen, here I think you will find the great outline of the charge, upon which, with such explanations as the rest of the written evidence will afford, and the additional circumstances disclosed by the parol testimony, you are to decide. 
EYRE 12485 I think I may state to you, without troubling you with particular evidence, that it is lear, from the whole mass of the evidence which you have heard, that these popular societies had, in the beginning of the year 1792, 80 conducted ihemeclres as to raise a question upon themselves, and their conduct, some time before the addresses to the National Convention took place; you will recollect that it appeared, from some of the papers which were read, that there was a society, calling themselves, he Friends of the People, consisting of men of rank and property, and of distinctior in the country, who had refused to correspond with the Constitutional Society, You will recullect, that the same set of men had exhorted the Sheffield Society, with whom they were in correspondence that year, and had exhorted them in vain, to make an exPlicit declaration of their attachment to the vernment, as by law established. Some of these popular societies had gone so far, that a society, at Stockport, put the question, di‘rectly, to the London Corresponding Society, by a letter, addressed to the precner ow at the bar, to know what it was they meant, and particularly to know, whether Meant to go on with the House of Lords? That society intimated their doubts, whether, with the House of Lords, they could effectuate ther plan of reform; or, whether with the arpa who made a part of the House of liberty of conscience, as they understood it, could ever be sacetacinny established. 
EYRE 12486 Another society, in the same year, from Norwich, put the question still more distinctly, and in a way which could not possibly be misunderstood ; for they put this direct question to the prisoner, Hardy, as secretary to the London Corresponding Society : Do you mtend to rip up the monarchy by the roots? It is in evidence, they suspected that this hs letter was a snare, intended for them; will recollect Lynam’s evidence to that and that they were on their guard. The prsoner, Hardy, for the society, answered both these letters. To be sure, one might reason ably have expected that men, who adopted the duke of Richmond’s plan, with sincerity of heart, and who meant not to go beyond his plan, would, when called upon, have most distinctly avowed the extent of their plan, m terms which could admit of no equivocatioz, or exception; that they would have avowed their dutiful attachment to the king; that they would have avowed their adherence te the constitution of the Fovemment, as by law established, in King, Lords, and Commons; that they would have left no man to doubt, and particularly those persons who put the question to them, what their opinion was upon these points, on which their opin was to govern the conduct of others. With respect to the-present letter, the move reasoa they had to suspect that letter to be a snare, laid for them, the more reason they had te speak out. 
EYRE 12487 What the opinion was that they really entertained, the answers to these two requisitions are supposed to be sufficient to enable you to discover; the letters and the answers shall now be read to you; before they are read, I would observe, once for all, that ma case of this nature, much stress t net to be laid on particular expressions. forbid that men’s lives should depend on nice inter pretations and constructions of words. I am against even a very strict interpretation of actions, to the prejudice of any prisoner; but sometimes expressions are too strong, sometimes transactions too explicit, to admit of a doubt as to their real interpretation meaning. 
EYRE 12488 Gentlemen, hear the answers to these two reinors sead 3 attend to foo a and se what it is they do import, ticularly whether they do import any satisinctony sal explicit avowal of attachment to the constitation of the country, as by nwcsyabliahed, King, Lords, aml Chcaesten, ‘ 
EYRE 12489 Cae ee A 
EYRE 12490 Gentlemen, all the observations that are to be made on the particular expressions in these two answers, have been already made to you by the counsel, and you will judge of their roper force. I have no occasion to repeat tan, Such of them as strike your minds, clearly and distinctly, are probably well founded. If it requires much niceness of critical inguiry to fix the meaning imputed to the words, I should advise you not to emplo: yourselves in that sort of criticism. I thin you would only entangle yourselves, and you would not see the case in its great outlines, which I believe is the only way in which it can be seen truly. One observation only I shall make on their answer, because it is immediately connected with the history of this transaction, namely, that, in their answer they inform the society at Stockport, that they have resolved on addressing the French National Convention, and then follows this extraordinary passage: ‘“ Without entering into the probable effects of such a measure, effects which your society will not fail to discover, we invite you to join us. What were to be the probable effects of this measure, which these persons were to discover? And why did not oy epaealy avow to this society the whole of their project, in terms that could admit of no yosaile equivocation, or doubt? These are Le only observations which I make on this tter. 
EYRE 12491 Gentlemen, they state that they had resolved to address the National Convention, and they did, in fact, address it; and it is very apparent in the evidence, that the society to which Hardy belonged took the lead in that measure. ‘They notify it not only to the Stockport Society, but also to the other societiea, with whom they were then in correspondence. They transmitted their resolution to address the Convention to the Society for ConStitutional Information; that society having declared their approbation of the intention, the London Corresponding Society transmitted to them the address, which they meant to send; the result was, that the Society for Constitutional Information did not think fit to join them ia that particular address, but they also resolved to present an address of their own to the Convention of France, and they, in fact, did so. What their objects were in presenting these addresses, are only darkly alluded to in the letter of the Corresponding jiety to the Society at Stockport; but whatever their objects might be, itis an observation which arises upon their conduct to-t J act, there- was little to be doue here, with wards those two societies to whom they sent these two letters, and upon their conduct in thus presenting these addresses, that if, in order to account for, and to explain the letters, iv could suppose that they had measures to p with those societies, the violence of some to check, the moderation of others to animate, for them to keep measures with those societies, and to answer every man in his own way, so‘as to lose none, and to increase the number of their followers ; and if you were disposed, therefore, to attribute the particular language of these answers to some such necessity, or policy, yet in respect of their conduct to the National Convention of France, they appear to be perfectly volunteers; to have no measures to keep with any body, and to be therefore directly responsible for all the consequences that might follow from such addresses. ‘ 
EYRE 12492 Gentlemen, it will be necessary to trouble you with the reading of these addresses; 
EYRE 12493 ause they, on the part of the prosecution, insist, that they admit of no explanation whatever; that they are the measures of determined Republicans, going out of their way to express their zeal in the cause of Republicanism
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12494  You will hear these addresses read, and you will judge for yourselves, how far they merit that imputation. 
EYRE 12495 Such was the language of these addresses, which were presented to the National Convery a France. ; ee entlemen, it appears from the evidence, that these addresses were presented by pers sons appointed from hence. The name of one of them is J. Frost. The language in which Frost presented them, you are in possession of; it has been laid before you, in the course of the evidence, but it may be proper that you should now hear it read again. 
EYRE 12496 I forbear, at this time, to remark on the conduct of the persons employed to present these addresses, except so far as that conduct is connected with the case of the prisoner at the bar, because, in any other view of it, it is not before you. The language used by Frost is connected with the case of the prisoner; for though not held by the prisoner himself, nor by the persons who deputed Frost to deliver the addresses, yet it is brought home to them, because the language of the presentation of the address is transmitted by Frost to the societies; and you will find, that, after they had been informed in what language it had been presented, an unqualified approbation of the conduct of Frost was given by the Society for Constitutional Information, of which Hardy was an associated member. 
EYRE 12497 An observation has been made upon one of these addresses, which declares, that till the National Convention of France had begun to respect to the views of these popular societies, What connexion the views of these popular societies could have with the National Convention of France, unless they had begun to entertain a new idea, or a new interpretation of the phrase, “ Representation of the people or any other objects, which made it necessaryby Universal Suffrage and Apnual Electons, arising out of the proceedings of the National Convention of France, or it not arising out of them, yet to be now adopted, in consequence of the National Convention of France having exhibited that great scene on the theatre of the world, and to be now attempted to be carried into execution, is for your judgment. The presenter of these addresses has expressed an expectation, that felicitations might soon come over to a National Assembly here. What that National Assembly was to be, which was to be established here in Fugland, and which was to be felicitated by France, will be a subject for your serious consideration, and must deserve and demand the deepest investigation. 
EYRE 12498 Gentlemen, I have stated to you, that the only effect, in this case, which the language of the delegate, who presented this address, can have, is in respect of the adoption of it by the prisoner, and by the persons concerned with him. It was truly observed, that, if an agent be employed, it would be cruel to bind his principal to any thing in which he went beyond the bounds of his agency. It would be cruel to impute the acts of an agent to his Principal, when that principal never approved of them ; but, if the principal does approve of them, there is no hardship in such imputation; there is no cruelly or hardship whatever in niaking the principal accountable for the conduct of the agent, in construing the language of the agent to be the language of the principal. 
EYRE 12499 Gentlemen, you will judge, whether those concerned to support this prosecution have, upon solid grounds, or otherwise, branded these proceedings with rank Republicanism, and with being a distinct avowal, that every one of those people was embarked in the cause of Republicanism: it is an extremely important point to settle; for, on your review of the subsequent transactions in this cause, they will undoubtedly have, and must have a very different complexion, as they are understood to be the proceedings of determined republicans, or as they are understood to be the Proceedings of dutiful and loyal subjects to the king, zealously affected to the constitution of the country, as established in a King, Lords, and Commons. Men of the one description are entitled to a large, liberal, and candid interpretation of all their words and actions. Men of those other principles must expect to have their language, sentiments, and conduct referred to those principles. 
EYRE 12500 Gentlemen, the next head of inquiry for you will be, the transactions of these societies, subsequent to the presenting of those addresses, and prior to the conception of the resent design of a National Convention in ngland, which is the immediate subject of this prosecution; and you will examine, whether the persons who had taken this extraordinary stepiwtuch seems to have been uncalled for, and to have for its principal object a public demonstration, that thus addressed the National Convention. were actuated by the same principle of &mocracy which governed the Convention.) ;1 say, whether the authors of it, and the perscas concerned in it, have in any manner redeemed themselves, by their subsequent conduc, from the imputation which the presenting these addresses has brought upon them. I stated to you, that, as far as voting an unqulitied approbation goes, they immediately adopted the comment upon their own condut, by their own agent, that probably a felicitation would come from France to a Natenal Assembly in England. There is nehng done by these societies to discourage the epectation of a National Convention in Ene. land; you will judge whether they have net taken very active steps to prepare the way for it. The acts of these societies, more im mediately referable to this subject, which have been laid before you, on the part of the prosecution, consist chiefly of resolutions, mporting warm and unqualified approbation of the works of two celebrated writers, Thomzs Paine and Joel Barlow ; the first writing ‘Ipoa the Rights of Man, and the last on what was called the Privileged Orders, Parts of these works have been read to you, and they area most direct attack on the establishmentot the monarchy of this country ; and they doatlck more or less pointedly and directly the establishment of that order in this country—the House of Lords. The societies not only approved of these works, but they dispervd them all over the country, with a wondcrul anxiety, and ata great expense. The proscutors, in this case, have asked the question, why was this done? They say it is acting consistently, if it is done by Republicans, who wish to subvert the monarchy, and overturn the established orders; but, if it 8 done by dutiful subjects of the king, and persons attached to the constitution of the cum try, what explanation can they give of it? In the defence that was made for the prisoner, it was observed, that there were parts of these works that went only, in general, to defend the Rights of Man in society, without gory to the establishments of this country; that to such parts of these works, there could be no reasonable objection ; and that those parts might, therefore, be disseminated by honest men and good subjects. Admit that the observation is fair; was it not the duty of honest men, and good subjects, who were dis seminating such parts of these works as mizht serve to enlighten mankind, on subjects 00 which they ought to be enlightened, to bare taken some pains to have separated the bad parts from the good, or at least to have ziven the public some caution, that, in reading those works, they should make a separation of themselves, that when they were read of the general Rights of Man, and fcam passages striking at the monarchy of thts country, they should be careful! not to imbibe persons whoprejudices against the monarchy? ‘That whes reading observations on Privileged Orders, they should take care to remember, this was not intended to strike at the orders of this country, to which the public had a devoted attachment? 
EYRE 12501 Such, gentlemen, would have been the conduct of good subjects, That this was not the conduct of these persons is most apparent; and that these publications must have had the eftect of doing a great deal of mischief, by alienating the minds of the king’s subjects from his person and government, and trom the constitution, is perfectly clear. How much of this effect these persons intended, I shall leave entirely fur your consideration ; thus much I think is clear, that there is nothing in those publications which can serve to remove any prejudices which arise against the prisoner, and the persons concerned with him, irom the addresses which was presented to the Convention of France. 
EYRE 12502 Gentlemen, another general feature in the transactions of those men, at this peried, is their numerous publications, complaining of grievances supposed to exist in this country, and the abundance of licentious observations scattered throughout these publications, all tending to produce the same effect—the alienation of the affections of the country from the king and government. Grievances may and will exist in all governments, and that they may exist in a greater or less degree, in this government, may be true; but dutiful and good subjects, who honestly mean the reform of these grievances, will take care, in their endeavours to procure this reform, not to hazard the overturning the government itself. 
EYRE 12503 These are the transactions in the early part of the year 1793, upon which the prosecutors rely, as manifesting a spirit of disaffection and republicanism by which these men were actuated, and as evidence of their having taken measures to prepare men’s minds for what they call a radical reform; in effect, a change in the whole government of the country. 
EYRE 12504 It appears, that in the course of the summer of that year the project of a National Convention, to be held in Scotland, originated ; and they say, on the part of the prosecntion, and certainly not without colour (how far it is distinctly proved you will judge), that it originated with the prisoner at the bar. They refer you to a letter, written by the priSoner to Skirving in Edinburgh. 
EYRE 12505 Now you will hear the answer read which Skirving sent to that letter, and you will aftend to it, because that answer is charged on the part of the prosecution to have a great deal of matter in it, tending to explain the mechanism of a National Convention, and also what was to be its great object. 
EYRE 12506 Gentlemen, every part of this letter deserves the most serious attention, in that view of it, which I pointed out to you just before the reading of the letter. I think there are some paragraphs in it which may require to be restated to you. ‘This letter says,—‘ 1 have not ahigher wish in the present exertions for reform, than to see the people universally and regularly associated; because I am persuaded that the present disastrous engagemenis will issue in ruin, and the people then must provide for themselves.

If we understand this to relate to any political engagements into which this country had entered, and which might end ill, the people would not have to provide for themselves; that would not dissuive the government.

EYRE 12513 Gentlemen, this is an exposition of this doctrine of a Convention coming from a Briton, and immediately communicated to the prisoner at the bar; and, rin that respect, has a direct application to him; and it is of importance, as it tends to satisfy you that he has not been surprised into any thing, but that having had this communication with Skirving on the subject, he had an opportunity of weighing it. 
EYRE 12514 There is in the evidence another exposition of a national convention, it may be pro that I should mention it, but I shall not state it with great particularity, because, under the circumstances of this case, I do not think it ought to press much against the prisoner
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12515 I maean the speech of Barrere on the subject of a national convention; in which he takes a great deal of pains to show, that it isa thing perfectly consistent with an established government.—That a national convention was the authority of the A seg at large, which might consist with the established governments of all countries. The use that might be made of this doctrine, by those who wished to reconcile the people to a national convention as a constitutional measure, is apparent, and the probable consequences of ouch a convention not less apparent. And here it is fit that I should take some notice to you of a circumstance not wholly unconnected with this pat of the subject: It was observed to you y the leading counsel on the part of the prisoner (to whom I am always desirous of paying attention), and the observation was repeated, that a people had a right to alter their government. That proposition, under certain circumstances, may be true; but it ought not to have been introduced into a court of justice, bound to administer the law of the existing government, and to suffer no innovation upon it, I did not interrupt the learned counsel when he stated this proposition, because I did not wish to stop him, or to disconcert the chain of his argument; but having passed it by upon that occasion, I feel it my duty to notice it now, because it can have no relation to the business before us, because it tends to unsettle men’s minds, to bring on a thirst for innovations, and to shake all the foundations of ppemanpent, proceed to take notice why Barrere’s exposition of a convention ought not to press the risoner; it came over to this country in the oniteur, and though it was ordered to be entered in the books of the Constitutional Society, yet it does not appear that it ever was translated into English, and therefore it was extremely probable the prisoner never had an opportunity of knowing Barrere’s sentiments on that subject, But it is otherwise with re
EYRE 12516 [sre spect to the letter that was sent to himself; he had a full opportunity of weighing it; of asking for explanation; or of correcting the ideas that were in it: and it gave him warning to take care that if such a convention was sct op foot, it might not lead to the consequences which seem to be pointed out in that letter. Gentlemen, on the fifth of October of that year the prisoner wrote a letter to Skirving, in answer to a letter of Skirving’s dated October the second; which last letter is not in evi dence. In this letter the prisoner mentiuns his having communicated to Margarot cay, Skirving’s project of a convention in Scotland; he recommends it to Skirving to write an official letter to his (Hardy’s) society, propose to them to send delegates to that convention; and, in that letter, he desires Skirving vot to take notice that he had any com Tounication with him. Here the prisoner, Hardy, appears quite in a new character. He was certainly not an inactive member of the society, independent of his being secretary to the society. Had he acted only as secretary, it might be said, he might have been misled in a great many things; he might have written many things which he did not understand, or which he had not time to weigh, as a man might write whole sheets without having any idea of the sense after he had written them: it was, therefore, very much in his favour to consider the prisoner only as a secretary. But here he certainly is a principal, and most extraordinarily so; a princi i with a great share of the spirit of intrigue and duplicity, which totally changes the character of the man, as it might have been collected from all the rest of the evidence in the cause. A letter is written accordingly by Skirving, and the delegates are appointed; they were two very able men, viz. Margarot and Gerrald. The Scottish Convention is held. They sat for fourteen days, and were then dispersed ty authority. What would have happened it that Scottish Convention had not dispersed, one can only conjecture ; but in order to form any rational conjecture, it is to attend to the general conduct of that convention. It is fit you should call back to ycur memory just the leading features of it. It is pressed on you, on behalf of the prisoner, that the meeting of the delegates of these bodies was for this single object—to consider what was the best way of appealing to parliament, in order to procure a returm in the Commons House of Parliament. As to that, you will recollect the transactions of that year respecting an application to parliament. There had been an application to parliament, and the principal mover was Mr. Grey. Of the sincerity of the honourable mover, in his application for a parliamentary reform, I suppose no man will doubt; but of the sincerity of the application of these popular societies to par liament, on the evidence before you, every man must doubt. They express themselves, upon more than one occasion, as disposed to consent to it only because it would prepare men for what was to follow, and serve to keep the public mind in agitation upon that subject. Considering this convention as assembled, in order to procure a reform in parliament, it would be fit to compare the means with the end, and then judge whether this ostensible purpose was the only purpose of this convention. 
EYRE 12517 When there was a motion made, that a scroll ofa petition to parliament should be prepared, they negatived it, and therefore, if that was their only object, the aed of their meeting was atan end; but, laying that object aside, view this conventionas it was ; yon find it closely imitating the manners of the National Convention of France; you hear of primary assemblies and sections; you perceive this National Convention assuming. to itself a formality of proceeding which is very becoming where it is subject to no just exception, but in the place in which it appears, cerinly very alarming. We findthe convention is constituted every day by solemn prayer ; it is closed every day by solemn praver. They had their committee of finances ; their patriotic donations, with honourable mention; their order of the day; their appellation of citizen ; and the tenth day they assumed this date, The first year of the British Convention : recollect, how all this follows the poe, of the National Convention of France. Who shall say what would have happened if that convention had not been dispersed at the end of fourteen days? Whoshall say that if they continued to assume in the manner in which they had begun, and some interval had been Pracied to them, and that in that time they had happened to gain the public opinion in their favour, judging by what happened in France, who shall say that this body of men would not have been the government of this country? This convention was, however, dispersed; the consequence of which has been, that legal proceedings have taken place against some of the members, upon which it would mot become me in this place to make any observations, except that occasion has been taken to complain of these proceedings as a grievance, and most certainly the prisoner, and those who are connected with him in these societies, did take occasion from thence to irritate the public mind to as great a degree as it was possible to do, by the reflections that were made on these proceedings. 
EYRE 12518 Gentlemen, there immediately followed upon the reflections which were dispersed on the subject ofthese proceedings, the plan of a British Convention to be held in England ; which leads us to the pointto which the whole of the present inquiry is to have its relation, mmore or less. Now it deserves serious attention on your parts to the circumstances with which this new plan of a convention was introduced to the public notice, and by which it was recommended to the public attention ; in order to enable you to Tue, whether the object of it was that peaceable ebject which is insisted on for the prisoner; whether a reform in the Commons House of Parliament wasreally the bottom of the whole; or whether the object of it must have been to alter the constitution of our government, to obtain indeed a full and perfect representation of the prople, but not in the Commons House of 
EYRE 12519 ‘arliament. 
EYRE 12520 One should have apprehended that under any provocation which these people professed to have felt, or which they might really feel, they would have pursued a very different course from that which they did pursue, as they were acquainted with the circumstances of the dispersion of the former convention, and with all the objections that were made to that convention. As they were determined to have another convention, it was to be expected that, at least, they would have taken care so to their language and proceedings, that it should be impossible they could be misunderstood ; to have expressed themselves clearly and distinctly on all occasions; to have explained the grounds of this convention; to have conducted themselves with a decent moderatiun towards the government of the country, and towards its proceedings, It might reasonably have been expected that they would have made an express avowal of loyal sentiments, and an express disavowal of going any lengths which could be justly objected to; an express disavowal of oing beyond the original object of pe amentary reform, as stated by the duke of Richmond. Every thing that was inflammatory ought-to have been most carefully avoided, in order to prevent their purpose being misunderstood; and what was more material, in order to ensure success to the measure itself. What was done you will see, and from that you will form your own conclusions. They published a paper, which you will hear rent. and you will attend to it. I do not consider it as my business to make particular comments on it, let it make its own impression on your minds. The paper I refer to (there are many which are connected with it) is the address of the 20th of January, 1794, of the London Corresponding Society, at a genera] meeting held at the Globe-tavern. 
EYRE 12521 Gentlemen, you have heard this paper read, it expressly refers to a convention; and it was certainly published ata time when an idea of a convention was in the minds of the people. Now you are to judge between the king and the prisoner upon the evidence which this paper affords, whether the object of that convention was merely to procure a free and full representation of the people in the Commons House of Parliament, and in the due course of law, and according to the constitution of the country, or whether that paper is to be understood as a manifesto to excite the people to overturn the government, and to direct the people's minds to the use that should be made of a convention for the purpose of overturning the government1. 
EYRE 12522 Gentlemen, this happened on the 20th of January, 1794; soon afterwards they began in these two societies to consider how this convention was to be brought about. The London Correspunding Society had come to a resolution upon it in terms which upon the face of it were open to some observations. A communication took place between the Corresponding Society and the Society for ConStitutional Infermation. The two societies appointed a joint committee, who came to a resolution expressed in more guarded language, which you will hear read. 
EYRE 12523 You see that this is a dry resolution to call a convention for the purpose of taking into consideration the proper method of obtaining a fair and full representation of the people. This is their object, as they think fit to express themselves upon consideration; and it ¢ertainly was not too late for them to have retracted any part of the rashness and violence of any former measure which they might have taken. If they, thinking they had been too violent in their expressions, or extravagant in their sentiments had come to this resvlution, with a view to remedy the fault of their former proceedings, and confine the objects of the convention within its just limits, that consideration would, no doubt, have its due weight; but even in this resolution we find nodeclaration that they sought only a refurm in the Commons House of Parliament, and that no attempt was meant against the King, and the jurisdiction and authority of the House of Lords.There was a joint committee of correspondence and co-operation appointed by these societies to consider of the means for carrying this resolution into execution, and it appears that they entered into a very extensive correspondence both in England and in Scotland for that purpose ; while that correspondence was going on, upon the 14th of April last, the London Corresponding Society held a general meeting ; it seems to have been originally intended to have been held in a large room in Store-street ; it was not held there probably from an apprehension that the magistrates might interfere, and therefore they adjourned to a place inthe neighbourhood of London, Chalk-farm, They there assembled to the number of two thousand or more, and there the resolutions, which will be read to you presently, were voted. These resolutions are as violent, or more so, than the former, and do not in the least correspond with the idea of applying to obtain a reform of parliament on the duke of Richmond’s plan, but seem rather calculated to prepare the minds of the people for a violent crisis, acrisis upon which a National Convention once assembled would immediately act, and in the nature of things would be called upon to act; this is the prosecutor’s construction of these resolutions. You will attend to them, and see whether tua is the proper construction to be. put upoa them—why they assembled that mecting at all is extremely difficult to comprehend. If they thought the former resolutions had gone too far, and would have been liable to creat misconstruction, and possibly might do a great deal of mischief, it might be necessary to call another meeting for the purpose of correcting what was extravagant in these resolutions, and of bringing back things toa more moderate tone ; to point out more disunctly the lawful objects they had in view, and wtally to exclude all idea of their going beyond those objects. Tobe sure such a meeting, in their circumstances, might have been vers proper ; but if it should appear that this second meeting was pursuing the same idea, and giving a great deal of countenance to what was done at the former meeting, that the as sembling of two thousand people must bave an effect to impress the public mind, that a force was ready to act when called upon, and they were determined to go on with that, which on the 20th of January they had promulgated to the world, If instead of intending to bring things back, or to remedy the effects of their foriner violence, we tind them advancing in the same carecr, and hastemag by the same means to the accomplishasx at ot their object, what must be the conclusiun? If instead of coming forward with a declaration of their loyalty to the throne, or their attacbment to the constitution of parliament, as far as respects the House of Lords, in order to do away the impression of their former proceedings, and remove all suspicion and ambiguity with respect to their future intentions, we find them coming forward with another minitesto; this manifesto comes forward in a still more questionable shape than the former, as it carnies along with it the appearance of great force, and may be understood to notfy that they are ready, if it shall be necessary, to sct in support of their former resolutions. You will fr these resolutions of Chalk-farm read, and you will form your own judgment on them. 
EYRE 12524 Gentlemen, one cannot hear this paper read, without feeling astonishment that men could be so blinded by enthusiasm, or by any other affection of the human mind, as not to see that in consequence of such a publication ag this, independent of its particular applica tion lo the subject of our present inquiry, the sword of the law was hanging over their heads by a single thread. They ap; to have linaeticd that the meeting of a conventwa could not be prevented but by act of parla ment. Suppose it was possible for them have believed that, and suppose the publicity of their proceedings to afford some argument that these men thought them legal, was possible, if they attended to the subject, or if they had taken any advice, not to see that it was extremely criminal to publish those resolutions to two hundred thousand people? and as many more as might have an opportunity of looking atthem. According to these resoJutions, it was a probable case “ that they would soon be in a state where the social compact would be actually dissolved, and that it-would be necessary to appeal to that principle, that incontrovertible maxim of eternal justice, that the safety of the people was the supreme, and in cases of necessity, the only law, which admits but of one interpretation. If the social compact is dissolved, there is an end of the government, of course there must be the establishment of another in its stead ; another government must be framed ; this is therefore expressly encouraging the people to look out for the moment to arrive when another government was to be framed, to be erected on the ruins of the present establishment. 
EYRE 12525 Gentlemen, it is of importance, with respect to the present question, that the eighth and tenth resolutions glance, not in an indirect manner, at the House of Lords, as a body in the contitution, not entitled to the respect of the people. Of what extreme consequence this was in the present moment you will see, because this was the moment in which, that which was to be done in the National Convention, was to occupy the minds of all people. And what was to 4 done? They say on the part of the prisoner, that he, and those who were associated with him, were in a dutiful, constitutional, and regular course, to collect sense of all people, and then present the united wishes of the peuple, in a regular and constitutional way, to parliament. Now was that, or could that be the object of men who had assumed so much of the republican character, who afler addressing the National Convention of France, had acted the part they done, up to the present moment, who were then talking of the social compact being dissolved, and were then speaking contemptuously of the other branch of the legislature. 
EYRE 12526 To this question, what was meant to be done in this convention, as resolved on, in January, 1792,and as followed up by the resolutions at Chalk-farm, on the 14th of April, belongs a transaction of a society at Sheffield, which has been a leading society in correspondence with the two societies here in London. ‘The society at Sheffield, had been artificially represented to be extremely numerous; there was a meeting, in fact, of ten thousand, on the 7th of April, on the Castle-hill, Several resolutions were there passed ; they were moved by a Mr. Yorke, not a native of that place, but who found his way among them, and made use of that opportunity. You have heard of Mr. Yorke being a member of the London Corresponding Society—under what directions he went to Sheffield, does not appear; how these resolutions were obtained, I 
EYRE 12527 do not think it material to observe upon, farther than that it isa satisfaction to know; that though multitudes are made parties to these proceedings, there is every reason in the world to belive, that but few are engaged in the depth of the project. Of the ‘ten thousand people assembled on the Castle-hill, there is no reason to suppose that two hundred knew what was going forward. A trick for negativing a resolution to petition parliament, was concerted between four people, and by their mancuvring, and management, these resolutions passed in such a way, that it was impos. sible they could be understood by the greatest part of the people; but however that was, the promulgation of them to the world at this juncture, appears tu have avery close connexion with this plan of aconvention. It was Proposed, and resolved, to petition parliament no more. It was observed by. the counsel for the prisoner, that oe cannot justly conclude, because an individual society, or those who conducted that society were of opinion that they should petition parliament no more, that therefore a body of men, more likely to command the attention of parliament, were not, according to their apprehension to apply to parliament, fora parliamentary reform. 
EYRE 12528 It was fairly put, and it is right and fit to see whether the observation is founded in the truth of the case. When you come to examine the resolution with the context, it hardly admits of that interpretation, because the reason they assign for not petitioning is, that they will not petition a body who are not their representatives. Now that reason must apply to the House of Commons for ever, accordin, to their notion of it, and as it was underst and adopted, by the Corresponding Society, and other societies with whom they were in correspondence. If it could not be the object of this convention to petition parliament, where shall we find the pie. but in the addresses to the nation immediately preceding and immediately following the promulgation of the project, which appear totally inconsistent with the idea of a convention for the purpose of an application to parliament, and to be consistent with, and calculated to give effect to aconvention for other purposes, and particularly for the purpose of concerting the means of establishing a representative government of the people
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12529 There is a piece of parol evidence, which respects this point fit to be stated—Lynam says, that at one of their meetings, Bell observed that their address to the National Convention in France, proved that they meant to introduce their laws here to which Mr. Margarot said, no doubt. The other persons present said nothing, Hardy was present and this passed at a mceting of the delegates; if therefore he had no doubt, and if the nature of the transactions countenances that opinion, and if the transactions taken together should be irreconcileable to the other opinion, then there is a weighty evidence for your consideration, to prove the whole extent of the proposition as it is stated on the part of the prosecution. 
EYRE 12530 The parol evidenceapplies both ways, many of the witnesses for the crown expressly disavow all force upon the government, and every other object beyond a reform in the ommons House of Parliament; on the other hand, individuals are charged with having attempted to corrunt the soldiery, and to have meditated a personal attack upon the king, and direct force against his government ; but this, however, I ought to observe, is not brought home to the prisoner. There is also parol evidence, though loose and unconmected, of a preparation of arms in which the prisoner is in some degree implicated. One witness, not of the best credit, said that they were to furnish themselves with arms to defend the National Convention when it should be called. This evidence in its nature is very important—this is clear, that in their idea of a national convention, every thing was therein to be conducted peaceably, and orderly, the national convention must then be protected from without, because it is by such a national convention being protected, and being left at liberty to act, that it could exeeute its orders and decrees; it seems, therefore, not imconsistent with the idea of a national convention which was to overturn the government, to inculcate peace, and good order; for the truth undoubtedly was, and these persons saw it, that whatever this national convention was to do, it must do by means of having the voice of the public going along with it. It was in that way only, that it could execute its purposes; the taking arms, therefore, to defend the national convention, has an immediate connexion with the charge. In the parol evidence it was also stated, that these people expected there would be a struggle before they obtained their object, and that they had made a preparation for it; several witnesses said, that their whole object, in furnishing themselves with arms was, to defend themselves against illegal attacks, and negatively, that they did not mean to attack the king, or the government. If they had no object Bavond pure self-defence, they might lawfully furnish themselves with arms. 
EYRE 12531 If they meant to put themselves into a condition to sustain their convention by force, against any attack which might be made upon it, or upon them in defence of it, «defence becomes offence and treason. 
EYRE 12532 Respecting the whole of this evidence as to arms, standing alone, I should have thought No great reliance was to be had upon it; connected, as it is, with the whole transactions of these bodies, it certainly is evidence very fit to be taken into consideration by the jury, and is of some use towarcs marking what was in the minds of the people at the time theylished in the name of the duke of Richmond— 
EYRE 12533 Proposed this conven'ion, and whether their purpose was that which this prosecution charges—a purpose of subverting the govern-ment of the country, consequently deposingcerned in this particular measure of a conventhe king, which is an overt ‘act of compatsmp the king’s death. 
EYRE 12534 Gentlemen, I have extracted from the evidence such parts of it, as appear to me matetially to bear upon the charge, in order that you may be able to take a distinct view of it, and to judge for yourselves, whether or not they justify the charge to the extent in which it is laid. 
EYRE 12535 But, before you come to that consideration, you are to attend, and to attend with favour, to every thing that can be urged on the part of A prisoner. " oe entlemen, on the part le prisoner, he part of the written Tiience has been cxtroverted: it-could not well be controverted, I do not think it has been very weightily urged that the prisoner did not take such an active share in these transactions, as te make ban, not only in strictness of law, a principal, bat, to the satisfaction of every man’s mind, 3 Principal in the whole of them. He was net only secretary to one of these societies, but a member of both, and an active member, and, in one or two instances, si ly active. He was the promoter, designer, and inventor of some of the measures, with some degree of mancuvring and management; and there fore I did not think it necessary to trouble you with separately stating the particular evidence which affects him. 
EYRE 12536 Gentlemen, they have made several fair and weighty observations on the credit and materiality of the parol testimony, in respect of the situation of the witnesses, many of them introducing themselves into these societies, for the purpose of erring saturation af what was passing there, antl also in respect of the subject matter of the testimony itvelf, particularly that of arming, as having so necessary connexion with this plan of a convention, which had been projected; sad I think there is a great deal of weight in thet observation; and if it depended entirely upon the circumstance of the arms, to manifest the purpose of a convention, I should stste to you, that, though it was a case of pret suspicion, yet that it hardly went to t! to fix on the convention a wicked purpose of that extraordinary extent which the prosecation has imputed to it, upon all the grounds of evidence, taken together, which the case furnishes. 
EYRE 12537 Gentlemen, they state the case of the prisoner thus : That he isa plain man, of simplicity of manners, peaceable and orderly in his deportment, and a friend to the constitution of his country; having one great political object in his mind, namely, the obtaining a radical reform in the Commoss House oF Parliament, by the introduction of universal suffrage and annual elections—Thet he had taken this object from a plan pub
EYRE 12538 They say, this has been the sole object ofall his measures ; and that, as faras he has been cue tion, his ideas on that subject were taken from that book; and there is certainly a very plain allusion in that book, to the people meeting together for the purpose of considering of the means to execute such parliamentary reform ; that he had an expectation, highly encouraged by the language of that book, that the united sense of a great number of people by their delegates in convention, expressed to parliament, might perhaps have better success than petitions from individuals, whether they were considered as individual men, or as individual societies of men. 
EYRE 12539 They farther insist for the prisoner, that here is to be found no proof of a design to use this convention to any other purpose; and that, as to the horrible purpose of subverting the government, they say, it is not only not proved, but, in the nature of the thing, is improbable, and even impossible, considering how disproportioned the means are to the end—That, if it is to be considered as a pro
EYRE 12540 Convention at Edinburgh, it ought not to be held to be treasonable, because that was treated as a misdemeanor only—They say, whatever violence there may be in the language of the resolutions, addresses, and other papers to which the prisoner has been privy, there is in them no demonstration of the treasonable designs now imputed to him, They appeal to the testimony of a great umber of members of the different societies with whom he has been connected, for the soundness of their principles, and of his own; ! their dutiful attachment to the king, and their reverence for the constitution of parliament, and for the Lord’s House of Parliament, as a branch of it. And the prisoner also appeals to the character given of him by acloud of respectable witnesses, who represent him as a peaceable, sedate, religious and moral man, aving as many of them collect from his conversation, this one object a reform of parliament; and, as a particular manifestation of the conscious ; Annocence of his conduct, they refer you toa proposition which he made to Mr. Sheridan, when that gentleman proposed to bring the proceedings of these societies before parliament, in the spring of the year 1793 : the prisoner offered to show him his books, papers, and, in short, all his correspondence, that had any relation to the subject, and was } 
EYRE 12541 ready to lay them before parliaient
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12542 He is also represented by Mr. Francis, as appearing to him to be deeply engaged in this business of a parliamentary reform, and sincerely desirous of obtaining it, in the regular course, by petition to the tlouse of Commons; and it appears that he hroughta petition to Mr. Francis, as from the society to which he belonged, to be by him presented to parliament.—This was m May, 1793.—The petition, I should add, was on the plan of the duke of Richmond; and it may be true, that this plan may have received countenance from the protest which has been read to you from the Lord’s Journals, made by a great number of the lords in parliament, and containing sentiments which, if you suppose it to have fallen into the hands of inferior men, who happen to be eager enthusiasts, certainly might have great weight with them.—But, gentlemen, you will observe what the duke of Richmond’s plan and the protest go to; if a question were to arise, whether, in a clear case of a project, strictly according to the duke of Richmond’s plan, and strictly according to the protest, any crime could be fastened upon the assembling a convention for the purpose of promoting the Project, these sentiments would have their weight : Here the application fails ; nobody can suppose that eit mond’s plan, or the language of the protest, goes in the smallest degree to countenance aconvention for the purpose of introducing a er the duke of Richdemocracy into the country, which is the purpose now imputed to this prisoner. ceeding of the same nature with the British } 
EYRE 12543 T have already given it as my opinion, thag it ought to be conceded to the prisoner, that really, and truly, when he set out in this business, he was sincerely attached to that re form, as expressed in the duke of Richmond’s plan; and probably, at that time, he had no idea of going beyond it; but the question now befure you is, whether he has not gone very far indeed beyond it. 
EYRE 12544 Mr. Solicitor General, in his reply, bas impeached some of the testimony that has been given for the prisoner, by implicating the witnesses belonging to some of these sacieties, in the violent measures which were adopted by these societies, and the Sheffield Socicty in particular, whose duplicity in their correspondence with the Constitutional Society, and the Society of the Friends of the Peuple, of which I have already taken notice, is open to a great deal of observation. Though men declare upon theiroaths that they are peaceable and orderly, and sincerely attached to the constitution of the country, and to their king, yet, if they are found to be en gaged in measures which imply directly the, contrary, it does go very strongly to the credit of their testimony; for, in that case, their testimony is “ Protestatio contra factum. 
EYRE 12545 Gentlemen, in the reply to that part of the evidence given by Mr. Francis, where he said the prisoner appeared to him to be perfectly sincere, it was observed, all this appears hy the evidence to have been mere pretence and pvlicy to carry on the general plan; the reply also observes on the evidence to his character, that though he has established by a cloud of witnesses, and in the most satisfactory manner, that he is in his private character a sedate, moral, religious, good man, yet that his conduct in all these transactions strongly marks, that he is so deeply tinctured with enthusiasm that his moral character may be but a neutral circumstance. The counsel in reply mentioned the famous case, when enthusiasm worked up to the utmostheight produced the fifth Monarchy Men aud that in their case the treason grew out of their religion, 
EYRE 12546 They say on the part of the prosccution, that the acts done by this man, as they appear from all the evidence, are totally inconsistent with the professions he has ‘made and the opinions he says he has entertained, namely, that his real object was only a reform in the Commons House of Parliament. 
EYRE 12547 Gentlemen, upon the whole of this statement of the charge, the defence and reply and upon the whule course of evidence before you, you have now to exercise your judgments. I desire, that in exercising your judgments you will pay no more attention to any thing I have said than that which is necessary to lead you to the consideration of those points which seem immediately to constitute the particular charge against this man, and to the evidence by which it is supponte to those points, and to that evidence y which the defence may be supported, and to the answer given to that defence. Every verdict ought to be the jury’s own and ought to proceed on clear grounds of fact—It ought to do so in a case of this nature more particularly, if possible, because one great object of this prosecution must be that the country ma. that the public justice of it has taken its fair course, and that you, the jury, have well and truly tried and true deliverance made between the gd and the prisoner at the bar, according to the law of the land and the oath which you have taken. 
EYRE 12548 Iam very sorry to have occasion to remark, that during the course of this trial the dignity of a court of justice has but too often been violated by improper behaviour both within and without doors; what it is men can mean by such conduct who do not wish at once to dissolve all government and the bonds of all society, I cannot imagine
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12549 I trust I shall hear no more of this.—You will now withdraw, gentlemen, and consider of your verdict. 
JURYMEMBER 12550 My lord, we wish to have a copy of the indictment to take out with us. 
JURYMEMBER 12551 be satisfied, that they may see 
EYRE 12552 I suppose there will be no objection to your taking out the indictment; it is not strictly lar, but I dare say it will be consented to on both sides. 
EYRE 12553 Gentlemen, I must apprize you, that after you have withdrawn there can be no refresh ment given to you
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12554 Do you wish to take any moderate refreshment before you with draw? 
JURYMEMBER 12555 My lord, we thank you, we shall not have occasion for any. 
JURYMEMBER 12556 Thomas Hardy set to the bar.

EYRE 12576 The bill against John Lovett was not found. 
EYRE 12577 The jury thanked the chief justice for the charge delivered to them the day on which the commission opened, which, at their reuest, was ordered to be printed. The judge thanked them in return for the compliment. As he would not affect to say that he delivered it without notes, he would chearfully acquiesce in their request. His lordship observed, that the jury had attended four days, and wished to know if they should proceed any farther that day? or if they meant to adjourn? After this conversation, they agreed to adjourn to next day at ten o’clock. 
EYRE 12578 The Attorney General made the usual motions, that copies of the indictments be given to the prisoners. 
EYRE 12579 The Chief Justice wished to know of the attorney general, what time he would be in readiness to deliver to the prisoners the panel of the jury, &c. as ten days were required before the trials could commence. 
EYRE 12580 The Attorney General said, he should be able to answer, and settle the business next lay. The Chief Justice next called upon the persons who attended as agents, solicitors, and others for the prisoners, and informed them, that by the usual application they may have access to the prisoners. He said, he would not harass the prisoners by having them brought up until their arraignment—to inform them of these particulars, for that copies of their indictments should be left with them, and wished this information might be immediately communicated
