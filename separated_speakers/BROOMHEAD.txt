BROOMHEAD 3801 I cannot ascertain the number, but there were not so Many as upon the Castle-hill. 
BROOMHEAD 3802 About how many do you think might be assembled
BROOMHEAD 3804 Tell us the manner in which you, together with that assembly of a thousand or two, celebrated that fast ; is the manner in which it is represented in this printed paper that I showed to you correct
BROOMHEAD 3806 What might the number of your society properly so called amount to
BROOMHEAD 3808 Are you divided into divisions
BROOMHEAD 3810 By whom had that mode been advised 
BROOMHEAD 3812 Do you think that 600 was the full amount of the members of your society at its greatest extent; do you believe it ever amounted to 2,000
BROOMHEAD 3814 The distribution into divisions or sections was not regularly executed 
BROOMHEAD 3816 What was done towards that 
BROOMHEAD 3818 What was the object of the distribution of these district books, where did they issue from 
BROOMHEAD 3820 By whose directions 
BROOMHEAD 3822 Were the society’s books printed by Gale, one of your members a printer at Sheffield
BROOMHEAD 3824 To what persons were they distributed, and for what purpose 
BROOMHEAD 3826 What was to be the mode in which these districts of the society, were to assemble’ themselves? — They were to meet if i thought proper, to collect pennies a wee principally, a penny a week from each member. 
BROOMHEAD 3827 Were there any regular periods at which the several sections or divisions were to com municate in one general assembly, or was that left to an emergency 
BROOMHEAD 3829 What was mentioned, but not executed 
BROOMHEAD 3831 So that the district meetings were not so regularly attended to, if 1 understand you, as the general meetings of the society 
BROOMHEAD 3836 Yes. 
BROOMHEAD 3838 Gale printedit
BROOMHEAD 3840 I believe it was composed by one Montgomery. 
BROOMHEAD 3842 Yes it was sung. 
BROOMHEAD 3844 I believe they were printed by Joseph Gale. 
BROOMHEAD 3847 Joseph Gale did not receive any money before the sale. 
BROOMHEAD 3849 I believe ! mer, Skirving, Margarot, and Gerrald; also it was a private matter. 
BROOMHEAD 3851 I do not know for certain. 
BROOMHEAD 3853 A gentleman from. Halifax. 
BROOMHEAD 3855 I do not recollect any at present. 
BROOMHEAD 3857 They were sold. 
BROOMHEAD 3859 I think not very extensive. 
BROOMHEAD 3861 Myself. 
BROOMHEAD 3864 It was extempore. 
BROOMHEAD 3866 Yes. 
BROOMHEAD 3868 lIndeed, I do not know; I took no account of it; it was delivered to be printed. 
BROOMHEAD 3870 I do not recollect ; it was at a private meeting that that was spoken of. 
BROOMHEAD 3872 Several members of the society. 
BROOMHEAD 3874 I have heard the name, but I do not know the person. 
BROOMHEAD 3876 I believe he might be. 
BROOMHEAD 3879 Yes. 
BROOMHEAD 3881 Yes. 
BROOMHEAD 3883 Yes. 
BROOMHEAD 3885 Yes. 
BROOMHEAD 3905 It was not enough to say, that the people were formerly Fepresented, but that they had a right to he Tepresented now. Did the ministry, therefore, mean to assert, that what was right today, was wrong to-morrow? Did they mean to declare, in the face of the world, that what was in conformity to the maxims of justice at that time, should, in so short a space, be deemed unjust, and punished as a crime ? “After having expatiated considerably on this very important subject, he proceeded with observing, that in all countries where severe and sanguinary punishments were encouraged, men could have no affection for the government under which they lived, and their ig se) to weaken or spells this right: 
BROOMHEAD 3912 Ministers of state, if ye mean to be wicked, suffer the people to write and speak ; you will find men corrupt enough to serve you according to your evil desires, and who will improve you in the art of Sejanus. If you mean to be good, permit them to write, you will find some honest men who will improve you in the art of a Turgot. How many things are ye still ignorant of, before you can become great either in good or in evil? I see no glory, no advantage, no pleasure, no safety, in any man reigning as a sultan over slaves. Such a horrid pre-eminence tarnishes the lustre of the most exalted station, It is, besides, precarious, for sultans are frequently deposed, and vengeance wreaked upon them. 
BROOMHEAD 3945 The ks of the Forth, the fields of Bannockburn and Culloden, and that tribunal of Edinburgh, which has disgraced your capital, shall yet bear testimony to the cause for which FLetcuer wrote, and Wattace bled. 
BROOMHEAD 3947 I had one in my hand, but cannot speak to every thing it contained. 
BROOMHEAD 3949 It was a call to the people to arm against foreign and internal enemies, and the reply which was made to it was couched in the same 
BROOMHEAD 3951 I do not recollect the exact time, but I read them both, and should have been happy if I had had them both here. 
BROOMHEAD 3953 It was given out, by various people in the town of Sheffield, we can never do any thing against these people, against the society, till we ourselves cause a riot. 
BROOMHEAD 3955 Yes; and I saw myself several persons ride up -and down, round the market-place, full gallop, to ride over people, when, at the same time, it was only boys. 
BROOMHEAD 3958 I never understood them in any other light, and what was said about them was in answer to this wicked hand-bill. There was neither Mr. Wilkinson’s name, nor Mr. Althorp’s, nor any gentleman’s name in the town to it. 
BROOMHEAD 3960 This was the very truth ; to oppose illegal force, and direct violation of the law of the land, made upon us, as was done at Manchester and at Birmingham. 
BROOMHEAD 3962 Mr. Gale had this hand-bill in his hand, when he first mentioned the pikes at this meeting, or in his pocket; and there were several resolves printed in his paper the week following, and direct answers thereto, mentioning something upon tHe matter. I would have brought them both with me, if I had been apprehensive of this. 
BROOMHEAD 3964 I think they ought to be sent to Bedlam, if they had. 
BROOMHEAD 3966 Just the same as flying to the sun. 
BROOMHEAD 3968 No; never. What was it that you wished to produce by these meetings of yours ?—To enlighten the people ; to show the people the reason, the ground of all their complaints and sufferings ; when a man works hard for thirteen or fourteen hours of the day, the week through, and is not able to maintain his family; that is what I understood of it; to show the people the ground of this; why they were not able. 
BROOMHEAD 3970 Yes, it was ; and as such we corresponded with the society of the Friends of the People, as well as the Constitutional Society. 
BROOMHEAD 3972 There were several communications, I know, received from that society. 
BROOMHEAD 3974 Yes. 
BROOMHEAD 3976 No. 
BROOMHEAD 3978 No. 
BROOMHEAD 3980 Yes, yes, 
BROOMHEAD 3982 No; andI do not believe there is such a wicked man amongst them. 
BROOMHEAD 3984 In the House of Commons. 
BROOMHEAD 3987 That the King, the Lords, and Commons, might themselves, with the concurrence of the nation, remedy these evils. As to reforming, as to the expenditure, and other matre we had not the vanity to think of sucha thing. 
BROOMHEAD 3989 Yes. 
BROOMHEAD 3991 Thereis no one doubts itin Sheffield, that will speak honestly. 
BROOMHEAD 3993 It avas. 
BROOMHEAD 3995 Not to my knowledg, hat persons might do, had any thing happened, as a convention being called, we cannot tell for their wickedness. 
BROOMHEAD 3997 Had there been a convention, those societies that sent them, I suppose, would have put confidence in them, and in their consultations, supposing them to be competent to devise and dircct the means to the end for a parliamentary reform—I understand it in that light. 
BROOMHEAD 3999 No; those would have acted peaceably that we should have sent; we should have sent none else but such. 
BROOMHEAD 4002 I always understood it 50 for my part. 
BROOMHEAD 4004 Yes. 
BROOMHEAD 4006 Yes. 
BROOMHEAD 4008 Yes. 
BROOMHEAD 4010 I do not now recollect the answer. 
BROOMHEAD 4012 Perhaps it might not be me. 
BROOMHEAD 4014 Yes. Did he ever act as secretary to your society ?—Yes. 
BROOMHEAD 4016 That he mightdo—thisI cannot say; but I do not know of a certainty that he did; because great part of the time when he was secretary, I had no concern with the society. 
BROOMHEAD 4018 I do not recollect its being discussed in a committee. 
BROOMHEAD 4020 Not in those meetings of the divisions I have been speakingof, 
BROOMHEAD 4022 Yes, it may have been—I do not recollect that it was. 
BROOMHEAD 4024 TJhat was discussed. 
BROOMHEAD 4026 I[ do not know that such a letter was communicated, nor such a letter received. 
BROOMHEAD 4028 Nay, I am not certain that it was the result of the determination of that meeting; I rather think that it was determined afterwards, if it was determined at all. 
BROOMHEAD 4030 No, he was not there then. 
BROOMHEAD 4032 Several persons spoke, among whom I was one. 
BROOMHEAD 4034 I might have read them. I will not say. I believe I might. 
BROOMHEAD 4036 Great numbers of people did not believe them, they did not believe them to be honest. 
BROOMHEAD 4038 Yes; there was something of that. 
BROOMHEAD 4040 It may, I do not recollect the time exactly ; I think it might be about that time. 
BROOMHEAD 4042 It was.And of course long before all these discussions. Be so good as to tell mea little more distinctly what this mischievous hand-bill was that excited you to arms—I believe it was calling upon people to associate, and to arm against foreign invaders and domestic enemies ?—Yes; but not with any magistrate’s hame to it. 
BROOMHEAD 4044  Yes; and that meeting, when arms were spoken of, it was determined, in several resolutions, to get those ams for the same purpose, in reply to that. 
BROOMHEAD 4046 I never did. 
BROOMHEAD 4048 Some few might, 
BROOMHEAD 4050 It was couched in words, which were taken and put into resolves, and advertised in Gale’s paper the next week. 
BROOMHEAD 4052 Y es, against foreign invaders and domestic enemies. 
BROOMHEAD 4054 It was needless till the injury was done. 
BROOMHEAD 4056 No; why should we till we were attacked? 
BROOMHEAD 4058 No, not to my knowledge. 
BROOMHEAD 4060 To that purpose, couched in their words. 
BROOMHEAD 4062 I always understood it in that light. 
BROOMHEAD 4064 These were drawn up by Gale and Yorke, and therefore they were winked at out of complaisance to them. 
BROOMHEAD 4066 I suppose they did, knowing them to be of superior knowledge. 
BROOMHEAD 4068 Yes, be. lieving them to be of superior knowledge to ourselves. 
BROOMHEAD 4070 There was then at that very time 3 petition to the king. 
BROOMHEAD 4072 Yes, and about a reform too. 
BROOMHEAD 4076 I hat was passed when the lecture was read. 
BROOMHEAD 4078 No ; long before. 
BROOMHEAD 4081 I never did; and I do not know whether any body else did or no. 
BROOMHEAD 4083 I never knew a syllable of that till I was informed of it before the privy council. 
BROOMHEAD 4085 I was not. 
BROOMHEAD 4087 Yes, I knew him some little time. 
BROOMHEAD 4089 Yes, I suppose he was. 
BROOMHEAD 4091 Well, but at the same time, there may be wicked men among all bodies. 
BROOMHEAD 4093 I will say this, he did it without the knowledge of the society, and that he did it without my knowledge. 
BROOMHEAD 4095 I have not a doubt of that being proved; but how can I speak to it when I did not know it? 
BROOMHEAD 4126 The worse than hypocritical hearts of those who are the Authors of such a measure—although they at present impose upom the ignorant and credulous, by such detestable, such pretended show of devotion, cannot escape the chastisement of that Power, whom they thus insult, and from whose judgment there is no appeal. 
BROOMHEAD 4134 Yes. 
BROOMHEAD 4136 It was the latter end of the year 1793—I do not know the week. What division were you ?—Division twentynine, 
BROOMHEAD 4138 Yes. 
BROOMHEAD 4140 I think I was the twenty-fifth member when I went in. 
BROOMHEAD 4142 Yes, by sizht. 
BROOMHEAD 4144 He became a member while 1 was there. Do you remember his being with you the latter end of the year 1793, at Rubinson’s Coffee-house?—Yes. 
BROOMHEAD 4146 I suppose between 60 and 100—the room was quite full. 
BROOMHEAD 4148 On the last night that he was at the society, he took leave of them by a. long speech—he said he was going to Bel-gi-um—Bel-gi-na. 
BROOMHEAD 4150 Yes ; thai he was going to heal the French army, and should be back by Christmas;.,that he had received a letter from a friend of his in Bel-gi-um, where they were going; that they would be ripe by Christmas —he was going at the head of them. 
BROOMHEAD 4152 For a revolution. 
BROOMHEAD 4154 He did. 8 
BROOMHEAD 4156 He said he was in hopes he should come at the head of them to Hi gland : 
BROOMHEAD 4158 To London. 
BROOMHEAD 4160 Yes, Lo, 
BROOMHEAD 4162 The substance of it was as I informed you before—thut he had received a letter to go over; that he had an offer of being a member of the National 
BROOMHEAD 4165 That the society would. 
BROOMHEAD 4167 Mr. Pitt’s he mentioned, the minister’s, and the king's. 
BROOMHEAD 4170 It was the 5th of November, 1793. 
BROOMHEAD 4172 Yes, he did—he made some observations upon them, but I cannot recollect the words now. 
BROOMHEAD 4174 The substance of it was, that it was what they had deserved —that they had met with their desert. 
BROOMHEAD 4176 I do not recollect that he did. 
BROOMHEAD 4178 He did make mention of the Sans Culottes ; that they were a set of brave fellows—He said a deal about them, that they were a set of brave fellows. 
BROOMHEAD 4180 I do not. 
BROOMHEAD 4182 He did. 
BROOMHEAD 4184 He said that he was in hopes when he came, he should find them all ready to join him, and that when the point came that he hoped the would not be afraid, and spring or shrin, from what they pretended to be; he said, it was impossible to do any thing without some bloodshed. 
BROOMHEAD 4186 The society ; he was speaking to the society. 
BROOMHEAD 4188 He said, that there would be no good done without some bloodshed. 
BROOMHEAD 4190 He said, that there was a set of brave men there. 
BROOMHEAD 4192 I cannot say that he did. 
BROOMHEAD 4194 I do not recollect. 
BROOMHEAD 4196 He did not say. 
BROOMHEAD 4198 No; there was such a thing mentioned in the society one night before; there was a person came in from Shefield, and said that they bad pikes made at Sheffield at sixpence a-piece 5 there was another made answer in the room, who he was I did not know, nor him from Sheffield; he said it would be for them to have the same, it would only be a Se n bread and cheese for one day ; Mr. Yorke was not there then. 
BROOMHEAD 4200 No, it might be two or three nights before. 
BROOMHEAD 4202 Quite unanimous; when he pet up we all got up and shook hands with im; all rose and shook hands with hi ood when he got up and left the room. 
BROOMHEAD 4204 I saw him no more after that. 
BROOMHEAD 4206 I did not. 
BROOMHEAD 4208 I went after that to Mr. Dundas’s office, and likewise to my lord mayor, who is sitting there : No, it was sir James Sanderson. 
BROOMHEAD 4210 No. 
BROOMHEAD 4212 No. 
BROOMHEAD 4214 Because I ay a it was proper that government should be let into the light of what the: were proceeding upon; immediately as found out what they were I gave information 
BROOMHEAD 4216  At the first I was asked to go to the society, I did not know what they were ; as soon asI got in, Smith was delegate ; the person with me was a friend of Smith's; they asked me to be made a member?— I did not know what it was, I gave irteen-pence, and they gave mea ticket. 
BROOMHEAD 4218 I gave it to Mr. Dundas’s secretary. 
BROOMHEAD 4220 I think I was seven times there.
