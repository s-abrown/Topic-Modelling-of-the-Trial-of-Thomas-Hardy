MRS_EVANS 8421 Yes. 
MRS_EVANS 8424 I did. 
MRS_EVANS 8426 One orang, when I called in at Mr. Evans’s room, Mr. Martin came in. 
MRS_EVANS 8428 I believe in April; it was three or four days before the Chalk- farm business. 
MRS_EVANS 8430 Mr. Martin came in, and tbe business of Chalk-farm came up; he asked meif I had read any thing of it—I told him I had not; in conyersation, he said he had drawn up, and I think he said he had sent the resolutions; I am certain he said he drew them up, and, he said, if they followed the resolutions, there would be warm. work, for he had put in plenty of Cayenne. 
MRS_EVANS 8432 There was. 
MRS_EVANS 8434 Very often.

MRS_EVANS 8487 Then that is all that you cam prove; ; ;
