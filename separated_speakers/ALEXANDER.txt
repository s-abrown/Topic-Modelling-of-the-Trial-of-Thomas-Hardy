ALEXANDER 4222 A linen-draper. 
ALEXANDER 4224 At the Rose, in the Fleet-market ; I reside there at present. 
ALEXANDER 4226 Towards the latter end of the year 1793. 
ALEXANDER 4228 I did not, though I became one. 
ALEXANDER 4230 I went for the Purpose of going to a club ; my acquaintance asked me if I would go to a society with him, and I went. 
ALEXANDER 4232 His name is Whitehorn. 
ALEXANDER 4234 N othing else. 
ALEXANDER 4236 He was not. 
ALEXANDER 4238 Some that were there as delegates; Ashley was there, and Baxter was there; these are all I know by name, except Whitchom. 
ALEXANDER 4240 I cannot say. ; What day of the week was it ?—Of a Tuesay. In what month ?—I cannot say the month: 
ALEXANDER 4242 I cannot. 
ALEXANDER 4244 No, nothing at all. 
ALEXANDER 4246 Till twelve---’till near one o'clock, 
ALEXANDER 4248 They had papers. 
ALEXANDER 4250 I think Mr. Smith had some pamphlet that night to be read ; he generally henoght papers of some kind. 
ALEXANDER 4252 Yes; there was something read that night. 
ALEXANDER 4254 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4256 There was nothing read till after I was admitted a member. 
ALEXANDER 4258 He asked Whitehorn. 
ALEXANDER 4260 No, he belonged to them before, to a society in Holborn, which I did not know till afterwards. ‘ 
ALEXANDER 4262 I missed’two or three nights. 
ALEXANDER 4264 I think I attended seven times. 
ALEXANDER 4266 No. 
ALEXANDER 4268 I do net recollect—Smith was there. 
ALEXANDER 4270 No; I conversed with Ashley, I spoke to him two or three times. 
ALEXANDER 4272 Not at all. 
ALEXANDER 4274 When I went I did not know what it was. 
ALEXANDER 4276 After I knew what they were I did. 
ALEXANDER 4278 I did not. 
ALEXANDER 4280  When I became a suamiber I did not know what they were. 
ALEXANDER 4282 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4284 I scarce knew what they meant by it when they read it over. 
ALEXANDER 4286 No. 
ALEXANDER 4289 I do not understand you. 
ALEXANDER 4291 I never wished any thing of the kind. 
ALEXANDER 4293 The reason of my becomine a member, was, when I went in, as I said before, Smith asked Whitehorne if I would not be made 8 member; he said no, I had better not to-night; but Smith urged him, and said make him a member ; then one got up and read a paper, I heard him read something, but I did not understand what he read till after I got the paper from him; they gave me afterwards what they read-over, and the ticket. 
ALEXANDER 4295 I do not kuow I read it that night, 
ALEXANDER 4297 Yes I did, 
ALEXANDER 4299 I did not. 
ALEXANDER 4301 I read it to two or three of my friends; they were of the same opinion as myself. 
ALEXANDER 4303 I left it at Mr. Dundas’s office. 
ALEXANDER 4305 I did; 1 went to see what they were upon. 
ALEXANDER 4307 I had not. 
ALEXANDER 4309 The second time I Did. 
ALEXANDER 4311 I did. 
ALEXANDER 4313 So I proved at last. 
ALEXANDER 4315 I went in order to see what their plan was, what the real grounds of it were. 
ALEXANDER 4317 They would not suffer it. 
ALEXANDER 4319 I did. Was it then that Yorke talked of the pikes?—No. 
ALEXANDER 4321  Every week. 
ALEXANDER 4323 The month I went I cannot say. 
ALEXANDER 4325 I n 1793. 
ALEXANDER 4327 Towards the latter end of the year. 
ALEXANDER 4329 I cannot say that; I recollect the day when Yorke made his speech, I attended twice after I had been with Mr. Dundas. 
ALEXANDER 4331 I cannot say ; I should know Ashley. 
ALEXANDER 4333 I do not know, I could not swear to them. 
ALEXANDER 4336 To say exactly I cannot re member ; there might be in the room upwards of sixty, or between that and an hundred; the room was as full as it could hold. 
ALEXANDER 4338 A coffee house in Shire-lane, 
ALEXANDER 4340 Yes, they did when he got up to quit the Toom. 
ALEXANDER 4342 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4344 Yes, Beb gi-am or Bel-gi-um. 
ALEXANDER 4346 No, nor did not know what it was. 
ALEXANDER 4348 Yes, he was going to BelSigne to head the French army, and should e back by Christmas; that he had received a letter from a friend of his in Bel-gi-um, thas they would be ripe by Christmas. 
ALEXANDER 4350 Nothing else. 
ALEXANDER 4352 No other reason. 
ALEXANDER 4354 There were three of my friends I mentioned it to, who thought I should do right, they said, in giving the information. 
ALEXANDER 4356 One, his name is Broughton, another isa widow lady, Mrs. Grasswood, and Mr. Bryant. 
ALEXANDER 4358 I am not in business for myself. 
ALEXANDER 4360 A linen-draper by profession. 
ALEXANDER 4362 No. Whom do you live with?—I am not ina situation at present. 
ALEXANDER 4364 Not in employment. 
ALEXANDER 4366 In May last. 
ALEXANDER 4368 In Moorfields. 
ALEXANDER 4370 At Mr. Kellerby’s, No. 14, Finsbury-place. 
ALEXANDER 4372 He was 
ALEXANDER 4375 Five months, When was it you went to him?—I left him in May—I went to him in December. 
ALEXANDER 4377 In December. 
ALEXANDER 4379 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4381 At Mr. Faulder’s, a linen-draper, on Holborn-bridge. 
ALEXANDER 4383 I lived there almost two years. 
ALEXANDER 4385 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4388 I have appli to different people. 
ALEXANDER 4390 To Twyman and James, in Holborn. 
ALEXANDER 4392 I applied to another person who has just opened shop; he was going to open shop, Mr. Marley, in Holborn, with him I agreed to live, No. 320, facing Gray’s-innte 
ALEXANDER 4394 Because I was obligated to attend here. 
ALEXANDER 4396 I have. 
ALEXANDER 4398 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4400 Twentyfive pounds. 
ALEXANDER 4402 Some time before he opened shop. 
ALEXANDER 4404 On the twenty-second of last month, I think. 
ALEXANDER 4406 I cannot say. 
ALEXANDER 4408 A considerable time before. 
ALEXANDER 4410 I believe the latter end of July, or the beginning of August. 
ALEXANDER 4412 I told him. 
ALEXANDER 4414 I told him the day after I had the subpeena that I must leave him. 
ALEXANDER 4416 I had the subpeena last Tuesday fortmig Who subpeena’d you?—Mr. Wood. 
ALEXANDER 4418 N o. 
ALEXANDER 4420 I did not. 
ALEXANDER 4422 No. 
ALEXANDER 4424 Yes, for ne other reason. 
ALEXANDER 4426 No. 
ALEXANDER 4428 For that continuance oF time that I expected it would be. 
ALEXANDER 4430 In Holborn. 
ALEXANDER 4432 Yes; I only left him last Friday. 
ALEXANDER 4434 I said I was going out of town. 
ALEXANDER 4436  Yes, Ido. 
ALEXANDER 4438 Because I expected to be sent for to Sheffield about Yorke. 
ALEXANDER 4440 I expected to go after, as soon as this was over. 
ALEXANDER 4442 I only surmised that in my own imagination. 
ALEXANDER 4444 No. 
ALEXANDER 4446 Look at the jury, do not look so much at me, I have seen enough of you.—The reason of my thinking so was, I had been informed before, that he was expected to have been tried at the last assizes at York. 
ALEXANDER 4448 Mr. Wood. 
ALEXANDER 4450 Immediately after this was over. 
ALEXANDER 4452  No. 
ALEXANDER 4454 At Mr. Faulder’s. 
ALEXANDER 4456 In Cheapside, with Mr. Smith. 
ALEXANDER 4458 That is between four and five years ago. 
ALEXANDER 4460 I was with him eighteen months, I believe. 
ALEXANDER 4462 I do not know that that is exactly the time. I left him, and went in the country for eleven months. 
ALEXANDER 4464 I went to see my friends. 
ALEXANDER 4466 At Washford, near Salisbury, six miles from Salisbury. 
ALEXANDER 4468 My aunt. 
ALEXANDER 4470 Alexander. 
ALEXANDER 4472 I was there eleven months. 
ALEXANDER 4474 To Mr. Marley’s. 
ALEXANDER 4476 I went from Smith’s to Faulder’s. 
ALEXANDER 4478 It is rather better than four, I believe. 
ALEXANDER 4480 I was with anauntin Old Bedlam. 
ALEXANDER 4482 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4484 On the other side Moorfields. 
ALEXANDER 4486 No, Simpson. 
ALEXANDER 4488 It is impossible for me to say exactly how long it was. 
ALEXANDER 4490 I went to Smith’s when I retumed from the country; from Smith’s I 
ALEXANDER 4493 Rather better than four years; but I cannot be certain. 
ALEXANDER 4495 We had some words. 
ALEXANDER 4497 I do not know I am sure exactly now; we had some words, and upon that account we parted. 
ALEXANDER 4500 I cannot recollect the words, it is so long ago. 
ALEXANDER 4502 I do not. 
ALEXANDER 4507 No. 
ALEXANDER 4516 Some words that happened between the shopman and me. We had words first, and then my master and I had some words on account of it, and then we parted. 
ALEXANDER 4518 We had some high words and he called me, I said I would not be put upon. 
ALEXANDER 4520 We had words—I was hot as well as him, I suppose—We called one another fools, I do not know whether we did not strike one another—he wanted to be head—I said I would not put up with it. 
ALEXANDER 4522 His name is Williams. 
ALEXANDER 4524 I do not recollect. 
ALEXANDER 4526 those who, to use the language of the Imperial Rescript, ‘ simpliciter visi sint dicere, qui non unum eundemque meditatum sermonem attulerint, sed ad ea que interro“ gaveras, extempore verisimilia resfonde‘ rint,’ are entitled to the fullest protection of the law, and ungt not by the ingenuity of a pleader to be led into perplexitics and seeming contradictions, The state of society in our neighbouring country.—the description of those who often appear there as witnesses in the trial of crimes, the greater frequency of false accusations, and sometimes of vexatious prosecutions, and the rule of evidence that the testimony of one witmess may in certain cases be sufficient to convict ; all account for, and perhaps render necessary, a mode of examination which has hitherto been little known in Scotland. 
ALEXANDER 4529 I do not. 
ALEXANDER 4531 Yes, once. 
ALEXANDER 4533 I went to Mr. Smith’s after returning from Salisbury ; then I went to my aunt’s in Old Bethlem; there I was till I went to Mr. Faulder’s. 
ALEXANDER 4535 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4537 I cannot say. I took no particular notice of any thing that I heard but that night. 
ALEXANDER 4539 I ill between eleven and twelve o'clock. 
ALEXANDER 4541 About eight, between eight and nine. 
ALEXANDER 4544 I won’t pretend to say I do any night, except that time that York made his specch ; that I can recollect particularly—various things were read over at different times. 
ALEXANDER 4546 Sitting there; they kept the books open, and they admitted members, till nine o’clock, I think it was. 
ALEXANDER 4548 I cannot say. 
ALEXANDER 4550 I do not know whether any members were admitted that night—there was in general, of nights; but the books were cep open for admission of them till nine o’clock. 
ALEXANDER 4552 I went there to hear what they had to say. 
ALEXANDER 4554 I took no particular notice of any thing. 
ALEXANDER 4556 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4558 I suppose about the same time. 
ALEXANDER 4560 I do not recollect any thing in particular. 
ALEXANDER 4562  do not recollect any thing at all. 
ALEXANDER 4564 About the same time, I suppose. 
ALEXANDER 4566 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4568 I cannot recollect to say in particular what nights they were?—I think I saw Mr. Yorke three times there, he came in with another person, he said they had becn to Newgate to Mr. Frost, and that he was to be pilloried the next day, he said he had had some words with Mr. Kirby. 
ALEXANDER 4570 I never heard Yorke mention about the pikes that I know of; it was a person in the room, I do not think Yorke was there the night the pikes were mentioned; it was a person came in from Sheffield, and said, they could get pikes at sixpence a-piece from Sheffield; another said, he thought it would do for them as well as for the people of Sheffield, and it was only living upon bread and cheese for one day. 
ALEXANDER 4572 I remember hearing Yorke speak another time about the army's being deteated, and their having mopsticks to defend Frost while he was plored. Was this on the seventh night?—I cannot say. 
ALEXANDER 4574 I was. 
ALEXANDER 4576 The same evening as the witness that was last examined, 
ALEXANDER 4578 Towards the latter end of the year. 
ALEXANDER 4580 I am shopman to a bookseller. 
ALEXANDER 4582 It was. 
ALEXANDER 4584 I believe we went together. 
ALEXANDER 4586 I cannot say; but we both went the same evening, I believe. 
ALEXANDER 4588 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4590 I believe we paid for a quarter that evening—I was there, to the best of my knowledge, about four or five times. 
ALEXANDER 4592 Only once, to the best of my knowledge. 
ALEXANDER 4594 I was not there above once or twice after that. 
ALEXANDER 4596 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4598 I could not conveniently attend—I left my situation—I did not know any partic ular reason. 
ALEXANDER 4600 I do particularly. 
ALEXANDER 4602 There might be from forty to sixty people. 
ALEXANDER 4604 He came in as though he had been thcre bef ore, and seemed to be very well known. 
ALEXANDER 4606 He made a long speech; I left him speaking, and do not remember any part of his speech, 
ALEXANDER 4608 At each time the room was nearly ull. 
ALEXANDER 4610 He seemed speaking very loud, but I was at the farther end of the room from him. 
ALEXANDER 4612 No ; not a sentence I could not swear to. 
ALEXANDER 4614 I believe it was the first night. 
ALEXANDER 4616 I understood something that he was going abroad 
ALEXANDER 4618 I believe he mentioned it in his speech; I did not mind the particular words; or whether I understood it from any body else in the room, I am not certain; but I understood he was about quitting England. 
ALEXANDER 4620 The late Mr. William Owen, in Fleet- street. 
ALEXANDER 4622 To Mr. Baxter’s, a bookseller, No. 81, in the Strand. 
ALEXANDER 4627 I saw'him a morning or two after we were there; I believe I might ask him how long he staid after I left the room, or something to that purpose. 
ALEXANDER 4629 Very soon after; I believe I was not there above four times. 
ALEXANDER 4631 Because I left the situation I was in. 
ALEXANDER 4633 I lodged at a different part of the town, and had not time if I had a will to go. 
ALEXANDER 4635 No;'if I had retained my situation, I should have gone again most likely. 
ALEXANDER 4638 No, quite the reverse. 
ALEXANDER 4640 Some months; I cannot say how long. 
ALEXANDER 4642 He was in a linen-draper’s shop. 
ALEXANDER 4644 At the first of my knowledge of him at Faulder’s at Holborn Bridge. 
ALEXANDER 4646  Examined by Mr. Bower. 
ALEXANDER 4648 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4650 A hair-dresser. 
ALEXANDER 4652 A turner. 
ALEXANDER 4654 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4656 I do not know exactly ; it is about two years ago, or above that. 
ALEXANDER 4658 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4660 We were not separated into divisions at that time ; we were all united, and used to meet at different houses. 
ALEXANDER 4662 I cannot say. 
ALEXANDER 4664 Sonie few hundreds, erhaps, 
ALEXANDER 4666 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4668 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4670 Toe best of my recollection, that was the first time I attended, and there was, perhaps, about two hundred. 
ALEXANDER 4672 Better than two years. 
ALEXANDER 4674 About two years. 
ALEXANDER 4676 At that house. 
ALEXANDER 4678 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4680 I do not. 
ALEXANDER 4682 About a twelve-month ago, I believe. 
ALEXANDER 4684 I cannot tell exactly the pes I saw him at; either at Mr. Gale’s, or Ir. Mavshall’s, 
ALEXANDER 4686 Yes; several. Do you recollect at any time, whether Mr. Yorke took an active part; who was chairman ?—He was. gencrally chairman when be was there. 
ALEXANDER 4688 I have seen him at about three or four different mectings. 
ALEXANDER 4690 TI saw him at one meeting in Queen-street. 
ALEXANDER 4692 It was not long after the execution of the king of France. 
ALEXANDER 4694 I saw him at another meeting, at the sign of the Barrel. 
ALEXANDER 4696 I cannot recollect. 
ALEXANDER 4698 I do not recollect any thing particular in his speech; he appeared to me to be rather in liquor, at the time he was there. 
ALEXANDER 4700  eae I saw him at the meeting at the Castleill. 
ALEXANDER 4702 No; April. 
ALEXANDER 4704 That was the meeting that the pamphlet you have been reading was proceeded upon. 
ALEXANDER 4706 I have been there when there have been delegates elected. 
ALEXANDER 4708 Oh! I was there. 
ALEXANDER 4710 I do not recollect the time; 1 suppose it is a twelve-month ago nearly. 
ALEXANDER 4712 Matthew Campbell Brown. 
ALEXANDER 4714 He is an attorney by profession, I believe. 
ALEXANDER 4716 Yes, he was; but some little time before that he used to act as a player. 
ALEXANDER 4718 I believe he did. 
ALEXANDER 4720 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4722 I think the first time that I saw him was the latter end of March, or beginning of April. 
ALEXANDER 4724 I was employed as hair-dresser to him, 
ALEXANDER 4726 At one Mr. Cawthorne’s. 
ALEXANDER 4728 I do not know in particular what he was about. 
ALEXANDER 4730 I cannot say I did; I saw an address afterwards that was said to be wrote by him. 
ALEXANDER 4732 Yes; I was. 
ALEXANDER 4737 In Little Turnstile, Holborn, 
ALEXANDER 4739 Part of them; and part of them met at John Shelmerdine’s. 
ALEXANDER 4741 Near the Borough, in Southwark. 
ALEXANDER 4743 I really cannot inform you. 
ALEXANDER 4745 I never made that inquiry. 
ALEXANDER 4763 Not to my knowe, : i id you know any of them ?—I knew that some of them were not. 
ALEXANDER 4765 I can tell no otherwise, only, that they could not any place else. It was thought proper, ey Franklow, and some others, that as they could not get members fast enough, that the association should be divided into ten divisions ; one division to be up at Spence’e—another at John Shelmerdine’s another in Westtainster, at Williamson’s; where the others were to be I do not know. 
ALEXANDER 4767 Yes ; there was conversation of that kind passed between them, more times than once, at the times ofnot. 
ALEXANDER 4770 I cannot tell; I never minuted any thing down. 
ALEXANDER 4772 I can go no further than this, that I could coltect so far es this, that if they could not get a reform of parliamert without it, they would endeavour to have got it by the force of arms. ; om 
ALEXANDER 4777 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4781 H e was. Did you know Shelmerdine ?—Yes. Was he a member?—He was. De you know John Williamson?—Yes; but T cannot say whether he was a member or 
ALEXANDER 4783 I never saw him but once, 
ALEXANDER 4796 He was. 
ALEXANDER 4798 I cannot recollect. 
ALEXANDER 4800 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4802 Mr. Hardy told me to meet a young man who would go with me to the division, and I should be admitted, and I was by that means admitted. ’ 
ALEXANDER 4804 I do not recollect that I 
ALEXANDER 4807 I have no reason to think he did not; I believe he did. 
ALEXANDER 4809 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4816 I really cannot name the ons; I make no doubt but what Mr. Nodder and Mr. Sanderson themselves might be present, they were members of the same association. 
ALEXANDER 4818 I cannot say I recollect any thing that he said particularly ; he was present when such conversation passed. 
ALEXANDER 4820 No. 
ALEXANDER 4822 No. 
ALEXANDER 4824 I was, : 
ALEXANDER 4826 I cannot tell, for I do not know any thing of any persons of that description. 
ALEXANDER 4828 None of that description as I know of. 
ALEXANDER 4830 Yes; I have said so already. 
ALEXANDER 4832 Yes. 
ALEXANDER 4840 I basa only seen them at Shelmerdine’s aad
