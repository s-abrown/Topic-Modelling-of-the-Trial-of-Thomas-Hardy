BOWER 555 o the secretary of the Society for Constitutional Information. 
BOWER 556 “ March 27, 1794, 
BOWER 557 “ Citizen; I am directed by the London Corresponding Society to transmit the following resolutions to the Society for Constitu‘tional Information, and to request the senti‘ments of that society respecting the important measures which the present juncture of affairs seems to require. The London Corresponding Society conceives that the moment is arrived when a full and explicit declaration is necessary from all the friends of freedom, ‘whether the late illegal and unheard-of prosecutions and sentences shall determine us to abandon our cause, or shall excite us to pursue a radical reform with an ardour proportioned to the magnitude of the object, and with a zeal as distinguished on our parts as the treachery of others in the same glorious cause is notorious; the Society for Constitutional Information is therefore required to determine whether or no they will be ready, when called upon,.to act in conjunction with this and other societies, to obtain a fair representation of the people ; whether they concur with us in seeing the necessity of a speedy convention, for the purpose of obtaining, in a constitutional and legal method, a redress of those grievances under which we at present labour, and which can only be effectually removed by a full and fair representation of the people of Great Britain, The London Corresponding Society cannot but remind their friends, that the present crisis demands all the prudence, unanimity, and vigour, that ever was or can be exerted by men and Brtons; nor do they doubt but that manly firmness and consistency will finally, and, they believe, shortly terminate in the full aecomplishment of all their wishes. I am, felow citizen (in my humble measure) a friend to the rights of man, , Harpy, Secretary. 
BOWER 558 “ Resolved unanimously,. 1. That, dear as justice and liberty are to Britons, yet the va lue of them is comparatively small without a dependence on their permanency, and there can be no security for the continuance of any right but in equal laws. 
BOWER 559 “ 2, That equat laws can never be expected but by a full and fair representation of the people ; to obtain which, in the way pointed out by the constitution, has been and is the sole object of this society ;. for this we are ready to hazard every thing, and never but with our lives will we relinquish an object which involves the happiness, or even the political existence, of ourselves and posterity. 
BOWER 560 “3, That it is the decided opinion of this society, that to secure ourselves from future feed: and scandalous prosecutions; w prevent a repetition of wicked and unjust se tences, and to recall those wise and wholesome laws that have been wrested from us, and of which scarcely a vestige remains, there ought to be immediately a convention of the people, by delegates deputed for that purpose from the different societies of the friends of freedom, assembled in the various parts of this nation, and we pledge ourselves to the public to pursue every legal method speedily accomplish so desirable a purpose. 
BOWER 561 “Postscript. I have to inform you, that 4 general meeting of the society will be holdea on Monday the 14th of April, the place to be ; announced by public advertisement. 
BOWER 562  You are, I believe, one of his majesty’s Mmessengers

From the Corresponding Society,—Mr. Moore in the chair, Mr. Baxter, Mr. Lovett, Mr. Hodgson, Mr. Thelwall, and Mr. Hardy, secretary
BOWER 578 there any thing struck out? 
BOWER 585 My lord, we read these two papers for the sake of bringing these parties together; now I shall produce the papers found in the prisoner’s custody. 
BOWER 586 Mr. Jokn Gurnell
BOWER 641 We will now read the Address. 
BOWER 728 Is that the prisoner’s hand-writing
BOWER 730 Do you believe it to be his hand-writing
BOWER 754 I will prove part of this letter to be in Mr. Horne Tooke’s hand-writing.

BOWER 756 Look at that letter, and see whether there is any part of it Mr. Tooke’s hand-writing — TI do not think that of it is Mr. Tooke’s hand-writing, but there is an interlineation which-T believe to be his hand-writing. 
BOWER 757 Have .you seen him write 
BOWER 759 Which are the parts 
BOWER 761 Do you believe it to be his 
BOWER 989 It is impossible. t 
BOWER 1124 These are the proceedings of the convention. 
BOWER 1132 There are subsequent approbations of them without end; we shall read evidence enough of that by and by. 
BOWER 1487 I should be ashamed to trouble the court with a word Ls this objection, for the sake of the piece of evidence that is now in my hand, because it does not appear, of itself, to be of so much importance as to demand so much attention ; but it will be of very considerable consequence in the course of these trials, if a piece of evidence, offered to the court under the circumstances in which we offer this letter, should not be considered, as good evidence. 
BOWER 1488 I will attend to what your lordship su gested, that the duty of counsel is to open the tendency of the evidence, at the time it is offered and objected to; and, with great deference to my friends who have gone before me, I do not think that they have opened the tendency of that part of this letter, which appears to me to be material, and to be an indisputable ground why it should be received in evidence. 
BOWER 1489 I must beg your lordships to advert to the state of the present cause. We have already proved, as against the pooner, a paper, signed with the name of John Martin, as chairman, at a meeting of the society of which he himself is secretary. This paper was brought home to him by evidence, and by etnch, he, therefore, admits, that Martin was the chairman of that meeting; the date of the letter, which I hold in my hand, is the 22d of January, 1794; it is subsequent to the period of that convention in Scotland, of which we have heard so much, and it is relative to that convention. ‘The letter which I want to read now is from Mr. Martin, who we have proved to be so connected with Mr. Hardy, to their delegate in Scotland, who was at that time, in consequence of the interposition of the civil magistrate, in confinement, as it appears, to encourage him to proceed in these efforts, which he was sent there to attempt, by telling him that subscriptions will now be raised, which will be an assistance to him, and by informing hiim that it may be thought advisable to have another meeting here, in a commodious place, for the purpose of carryin into effect the views of the convention, which the magistracy of that country interrupted. That is the tendency of the greatest part of the letter, which we now offer to the Court; and if we have brought ourselves into the situation of showing, as I trust we have, that Mr. Hardy has admitted Mr. Martin to be chairman of the Corresponding Society ; if we have proved that the object of that society was to accomplish certain purposes; when I say we have proved, I take it we have given evidence to prove it; if we have proved, that the objects of that society were, to carry certain purposes into effect, by means of the convention ; if we show incitement from a person proved to be connected with the prisoner in the way Martin has been proved, to proceed in those steps which are the objects of that convention, and to persevere in those measures, which were the measures used to bring about the ultimate purposes of that convention, we may prove a direct act, done in furtherance of that conspiracy, by showing a direct incitement, by a Jetter in the very words of the overt act charged in this indictment, to persevere, and go on with that conduct, which was to lead to the ultimate end that the society had in view. 
BOWER 1491 The argument would, perhaps, be stronger, if it had come to his hands ; but, with great submission to your lordship, it is evidence of the intent of this Mr. Martin to encourage the party, who appears to have been intended to have been addressed by this letter, in the general purposes for which this society has been established, and which they were going to carry into effect; but it is not so strong, to be sure, as if I could prove that it arrived at Margarot’s possession, because, I take it, that would put it out of all doubt; but any letter, written from a conspirator in the connexion we have proved Mr. Martin to be, having proved him to be chairman of that very meeting, the object of this letter being to persevere in these measures, and to forward those purposes, which we have proved the society had in view, and that Martin, the man who writes this letter, particularly had in view, by the transactions at the Globe tavern, is not, I conceive, a recital of any thing that has passed, but a direct incitement to go on with that act, which we are about to prove, as being the act intended by this society to be carried into effect, by the joint or individual efforts of the members of the society. It does appear to me to be material, that we should now know whether or no, when we have established an intimate connexion between Martin and the prisoner, that an act done by Martin, in direct furtherance and prosecution of the main design, should not be admitted as evidence against the prisoner, though we have given evidence, that they were connected in the individual and particular act which is the subject of the evidence that has been offered. I submit to your lordships, that this is evidence which, in this stage of the cause, ought to be received; and it is not for the materiality of this piece of evidence, but for the sake of the principle that we wish to have established.

BOWER 1665 “ Sir; I am directed by the Society for Constitutional Information, to return you their sincere thanks for the honour you have done them, in requesting them to become trustees of the sum of one thousand pounds, which has been produced by the profits of the sale of the Rights of Man, and leaving it to them to apply it to such purposes as they should judge proper. They have a just sense of the confidence that you have placed in them, and of the generosity and disinterestedness of your offer, but they cannot think that it is an offer they should accept. The eminent services which have been rendered to the public by your invaluable writings, have never yet met with an adequate reward, and they think that it would be an extreme injustice to deprive you of any benefits which might be derived from their sale; for itis but reasonable, that those who are possessed of literary talents, and who employ them toPromote the happiness of the community to which they belong, and to mankind at large, should receive those advantages which may be obtained by their writings, and which may be enjoyed with integrity and honour. But though the society decline the offer which you have. been pleased to make them, they cannot do it, without,.at the same time, con. gratulating you upon the consciousness which you must possess of having contributed, by your writings, to the illumination of so many millions of human beings, in this country, America, an in other nations, on subjects of the highest importance to the universal freedom and happiness of mankind. I am, with great esteem, sir, your most obedient servant, e be D. A. secretary. o Mr. Thomas Paine.

I will certainly present the petition if it is desired, because I would not decline presenting a petition for any of my constituents; but I confess I think it might with more propriety be presented by some other member, because it is generall understood that the radical reform, which it recommends, is universal representation, to which I have always been an avowed enemy.

BOWER 6911 You had better pass it over if you cannot make it out well. 
BOWER 6924 What was the proposition? To advertise a public meeting; and that it should be advertised to meet at five o'clock, but the intention was to meet and begin upon business at six; a motion from division No. 8, —

BOWER 9315 Were you a member of the Constitational Society 
BOWER 9317 You were a member of both societies
BOWER 9319 When were you elected a member of the Corresponding Society? —I imagine better than two years ago. 
BOWER 9320 How long have you belonged to the Constitutional Society 
BOWER 9322 You heard several men speak upon politics? —I have heard several very clever speeches. 
BOWER 9323 Were they clever speeches by clever men
BOWER 9325 Did they strike you as clever speeches from clever men
BOWER 9327 You took up your idea of politics from them 
BOWER 9329 You did not go to these societies to read the public papers, or to read the debates in both Houses of Parliament 
BOWER 9331 Which way then did you get your informa tion? 
BOWER 9332 Wills —What information ? 
BOWER 9333 Mr. Bower—Upon politics; you said ie went there not having an Spron aay of attending both Houses of Parliament 
BOWER 9335 Upon what subject
BOWER 9337 Were any subjects discussed that did not relate to politics 
BOWER 9339 Upon your oath, when you went there, did you expect to hear arly discussion upon any subject but politics
BOWER 9341 That is no answer to my question; wha you went there, you said, you went there because you had no opportunity of attending the Houses of parliament, and went to hear clever then speak; upon what subject did you gu expecting to hear them speak 
BOWER 9343 And those only 
BOWER 9345 Was that the place where you took up your constitutional doctrine 
BOWER 9347 From the newspapers 
BOWER 9349 And you went to the Constitutional Society not having opportunities to attend the House of Commons, to supply that defect
BOWER 9351 You had no other means of supplying the information 
BOWER 9353 Did you attend frequently
BOWER 9355 I know nothing.—I ask you
BOWER 9357 Did you not, upon your oath, attend them weekly 
BOWER 9361  Were youatall acquainted with the proceedings of the society —Very little ; Tnever looked into their books. 
BOWER 9362 Then you did not know of any of their transactions which might bring some of them, or those they employed, into difficulties No, 
BOWER 9363 You never knew that any body was prosecuted fur assisting them in their views
BOWER 9365 Did you never hear of one William Carter
BOWER 9367 Then, of course, you never heard that he was in cunfinement at all
BOWER 9369 Do you recollect Carter, the bill sticker 
BOWER 9371 You heard nothing more of him but that there was such a man
BOWER 9373 That is all. You never heard that there was a subscription entered into for him
BOWER 9375 That is then what you now mean to swear distinctly, for I will not let you now go back ? Ido not say I gave two guineas, or five, but 
BOWER 9376 T only say I subscribed something, perhaps, to the poor man’s family. 
BOWER 9377 Did not vou say two or five guineas
BOWER 9379 Did you not, a minute ago, say you might: have given a shilling, or half-a-crown, or a guinea, or five guineas, to this man, in confinement, for sticking up bills
BOWER 9381 Your gestures will not do 
BOWER 9383 Ido not wish to confuse you ; the more distinct you give your answer the better; do you mean to say, upon your oath, that you did not recollect when you said, you might have given one, two, or five guineas to this man 
BOWER 9385 Did you give one, two, or five guineas 
BOWER 9387 Then, I understand, you now swear dis-: tinctly, you might give this man a shilling; but that you did not give him five guineas 
BOWER 9389 Upon your oath, you did not give this man two guineas, or five guineas
BOWER 9391 You never gave him a guinea, or five gui-. neas

BOWER 9399 Who asked you for it
BOWER 9401 What societies 
BOWER 9403 At the time you gave that, was a subscription put about for the relief of this man so in custody 
BOWER 9405 Did you attend one, or more of theee s0cieties 
BOWER 9407 Which was that
BOWER 9409 At which house 
BOWER 9411 Was it there you subscribed
BOWER 9413 Was Compton-street a place where the delegates met, or a division meeting Among the divisions, I believe; I did not belong to any delegate society, but to the common meeting. 
BOWER 9414 Which division of the society did you belong to
BOWER 9416 Did you go there as a visitor 
BOWER 9418 You are now a member of the Covent Garden division 
BOWER 9420 Then, whether you have been a member of that in Compton-street, you do not know 
BOWER 9422 The same division 
BOWER 9424 My question is, whether you belonged to one, or two divisions of this society 
BOWER 9426 Did you belong to more than two
BOWER 9428 When you werein the society, did you know any thing of any secret committee; perhaps a never heard of any such thing 
BOWER 9430 Of course you know nothing of any secret committee 
BOWER 9432 Ifa secret committee had been mentioned, it would have been to you a matter of surrise 
BOWER 9434 Did you ever hear of any letter that had been written by the prisoner —Never. 
BOWER 10300 Be so good as to remember, when you an-swer my questions, that you have spoken about the solemnity of your oath—You have been a member of the Sheffield Society, you say, from the year 1791
BOWER 10302 Have you been intimately acquainted with the proceedings of that society 
BOWER 10304 You stated that, I think —Yes. Had you a committee of members of your. society, who managed for the society 
BOWER 10306 Were you a member of that committee 
BOWER 10308 Were you there at the time when twelve’ members were sent, or intended to be sent, from the Constitutional Society at Sheffield, to the Constitutional Society in London
BOWER 10310 Do you not know, in fact, you that were intimate with all the proceedings of the society, that twelve members were deputed from Sheffield, to be elected members of the Constitutional Society, in London? 
BOWER 10312 Yes
BOWER 10314 If you mean to turn any thing upon the word elected,—to be sent, to have a communication with them ? 
BOWER 10315 Oukes
BOWER 10317 Yes
BOWER 10319 Were they to be associated, any of your members with the society in London 
BOWER 10321 Were they then to be associated by correspondence 
BOWER 10323 Were you there then, when it was agreed, or settled, that twelve members of your s0ciety should be associated with the Landon society, for the purpose of correspondence 
BOWER 10325 Did you never hear in the committee, that such a step had been agreed upon 
BOWER 10327 I beg you would recollect yourself, whether you do not recollect that such a circumstance appencd; do you meun to say it did not happen 
BOWER 10329 Do you not believe the fact, that such persons were associated 
BOWER 10331 Do you know, whether. any proposal that was mnade about associating members of your society, came from London, or was at first Propet from Sheffield 
BOWER 10333 Did you constantly attend the committecs 
BOWER 10335 And you never heard, either before or after such a measure, that it had actually taken place 
BOWER 10341 What are become of those proceedings that were put into writing at those committees 
BOWER 10343 Tn whose custody were the proceedings that were put into writing usually kept 
BOWER 10345 You said, you expected your petitions would be heard; were you present, when that resolution passed which we have been talking of, when it was resolved not to petition parliamont any more 
BOWER 10347 Were you present when any letter was written from the Conmuvaonah Society at Shellield, to the Society for Constitutional Information at London, respecting a radical reforin of the country, the 14th of March 1792; that is long subsequent to the time of your Lecoming a member 
BOWER 10349 I will show it you; do you know a man of the name of Sarouel Ashton 
BOWER 10351 Was he an active member of your society 
BOWER 10353 Up to what period 
BOWER 10355 Where is he now 
BOWER 10357 ton’s hand-writing; I am going to call a vie 
BOWER 10358 Ishe at Sheffield
BOWER 10360 Did he correspond with the London Cor. responding Society, in the name of the Shefield Society 
BOWER 10362 Is that letter Ashton’s hand-writing
BOWER 10364 You must have seen him write frequeally in the society
BOWER 10366 Have you never seen Ashton write, upca the solemn oath to which you have appealed
BOWER 10368 Have you seen him write upon any sub ject 
BOWER 10397 Upon your oath, do you ever remember a report being made of the proceedings about the period of the 14th of March, 1792 
BOWER 10399 You say, in that letter, that it is upon the pede of the Rights of Man; had those woks been received in your society as the principles upon which you were to act, Paine’s Rights of Man 
BOWER 10401 Your pwnciples, however, that you state, are the right to a thorough reformation, a radical returm of the country, upon a system consistent with the rights of man. Were the rights of man described in that book and this Ietter 
BOWER 10408  this is not the paper that Iam examining to; but 1 have no objection in the world to his reading it. 
BOWER 10411 As you desire to have it read, let the witness read it aloud, “ Sir ; It is now abouts four months since this society farst formed itself into a regular body, then but very few in number; the enclosed will inform you of their increase, and which, is most probable, will soon become very numerous ; and notonly this large and populous town, but the whole neighbourhood, tor many miles round about, have an attentive eye upun us; most of the towns and vallages, indeed, are furming themsclves to good order and regularity, and the need we have of coasulting and communicating with those who are sincere friends, and able advocates for the same cause; for these reasons, we took the liberty of writing ta Mr. 
BOWER 10412 Horne Tvoke, that worthy friend and patriotfor the rights of the people, informing him of our earnest desires of entering into a cen-' nexion with the society of the same denomination with ours in London: His very obliging and affectionate answer favours us wit your address; In consequence, we have taken the liberty, herewith to transmit to you some resolves, which were passed at our last meetings by the whole body; and the committee was charged with the dispatch of printing, and forwarding them to you accordingly, for the purpose of submitting them to the consideration of your society, ta make such use of them as they think most prudent. 
BOWER 10413 “ You will also notice the Belpar address ; they applied to us, about two munths ago, for instructions, as to our mode of conducting, &c. had not then formed themselves into any regular association. Belpar is nearly thirty miles from this place, in Derbyshire, and cight or ten miles from Derby. 
BOWER 10414 f the Society for Constitutional Information, in London, should vouchsafe so far to notice us, as to enter into a connexion and correspondence with us, it cannot fail of promoting honour, and adding strength to our feeble endeavours, and to the common cause, which is the entire motive we have in view. Tam, sir, with the greatest respeet and esteem, your sincere friend, 
BOWER 10415 By order of the committee, 
BOWER 10416 “ Sheffield, “ SAMUEL ASHTON, 14th March 1792. 
BOWER 10417 Campo-lane.’ 
BOWER 10418 “We have taken the liberty of enclosing a parcel for Mr. Hardy, in answer to a letter from him to this society, requesting some information concerning our methad of conducting the business we are embarked in, &c. also informing us, there are, in London, a number of mechanics, shopkeepers, &c. forming themsclvcs into a society, on the broad basis of the Rights of Nan. You will be so obliging as to let the packet remain with you ; until he call for it, as by this post I have ; wrote him thereof. We have given him our manner of proceeding, from our setting out to this time, and hope it may be of some use ; the improvement we are about to adopt is certainly the best for managing large bodies, as in great and populous towns, viz. dividing ; them into small bodies or meetings of ten Persons cach, and those ten to appoint a delegate: ten of these delegates form another meeting, and so on, delegating from one another, till at last are reduced to a proper number for constituting the committee, or ; grand council. 
BOWER 10419 into simailar associations, and strictly adhere to the mode of copying after us; you will easily conceive the necessity for the leading mem bers of this body, tu pay strict alleution 
BOWER 10420 Please to forward the packet to Mr. Hardy, as soon as convenient. 
BOWER 10421 The last letter was: put into your hand by a mistake; I would wish you tocal reform ofthe country, what word was the read this letter [giving the witness another letter-]— It is the same date, the 14th of March, 1792; Sheffield Society for Constitutional Information, to the Society for Constitutional Information, in London. 
BOWER 10422 Who is it directed to on the other side 
BOWER 10425 Certainly.—Is that the handwriting of Mr. Ashton 
BOWER 10427 Do you believe it to be his hand-writing
BOWER 10429 You have seen him write
BOWER 10435 In that part where it says— “the people are determined to obtain a radiword originally, where the word country is now 
BOWER 10437 Do you know how those two letters of te same date came to be sent on the same day
BOWER 10439 Did you ever hear of this letter, which I have now desired you to read, before it was written, or afterwards 
BOWER 10441 Do you not recollect hearing of that leter at all
BOWER 10443 That was a letter then composed by the scret committee, which never was communcated to you, at least ? 
BOWER 10444 Oakes. By the secret committee ? 
BOWER 10445 By the committee 
BOWER 10447 It never was comm inicated, to your know ledge, to the society 
BOWER 10449 I ask whether, to your knowledge, it ever was communicated to the society 
BOWER 10453 You say you were present at the meeting at the Castle-hill 
BOWER 10455 Did you hear Yorke’s speech there 
BOWER 10457 Have you read it since it was printed
BOWER 10459 Have you never read his speech 
BOWER 10461 Did you know Mr. Brown 
BOWER 10463 Was he the editor of the Patriot, I mes the gentleman sent as alee Matthee Campbell Brown 
BOWER 10465 Did you ever read a paper at Sheffield under he name of the Patriot? 
BOWER 10466 jakes—Do you mean a newspaper, or 3 book which calor outin numbers? 
BOWER 10467 T believe it came out both ways; did you ever read either of them
BOWER 10469 Did you read the book that was published under the title of the Patriot 
BOWER 10475 Look at the resolutions in the printed paper pasted into that book. 
BOWER 10476 Oakes
BOWER 10480 Read it over aloud ; it bas been read already. 
BOWER 10482 Now, upon your oath, were’ 
BOWER 10483 those resolutions, or ques copies of them, circulated at Sheffield as the resolutions of your society 
BOWER 10485 You have seen them in circulation there; have you not 
BOWER 10487 Did you at that time, or your society, circulate the books which are referred to in those resolutions—I mean this part, “ we declare that we have derived more true knowledge from the two works of Mr. Thomas Paine, intituled,Rights of Man, part the first and second than from any other author on the subject— the practice, as well as the principle of government, is laid down in those works in a manner so clear and irresistibly convincing, that this society do hereby resolve to give their thanks to Mr. Paine for his two said publications, intituled Rights of Man, part the first and second
BOWER 10489 Iam not talking about their being proved to bea libel, but whether these books were circulated by your society, about Sheffield, as the principles of government which you had, adopted
BOWER 10491 Were they circulated by the members of your society, in the neighbourhood of Sheftield, in very great numbers 
BOWER 10493 Do you know that they were circulated by the members of that society at all
BOWER 10495 I beg it to be understood that the question has nothing todo with proved to be a libel ; but were they not, in fact, circulated 
BOWER 10497 By whom ; by Gale
BOWER 10499 By whom, do you know, were they circulated—were they circulated by the members of that society, to your knowledge 
BOWER 10501 ho was this David Martin, who signs those resolutions as chairman of your committee 
BOWER 10503 Was he, at the time those resolutions passed 
BOWER 10505 Did you not know the time till asked you to the time now
BOWER 10507 Did you not know he was chairman 
BOWER 10509 How many members had you about this time in the Constitutional Society 
BOWER 10511 Do you mean to say you do not know whether there were twenty-five hundred, or ten thousand 
BOWER 10513 As near as you can
BOWER 10515 As Mear as you can ? 
BOWER 10518 About how many 
BOWER 10520 How came you to say, in your resolutions, that they were increased to nearly two thowsand, if they were only two hundred
BOWER 10522 You begin by stating, “ This society, com posed chiefly of the manufacturers of Sheffield, egan about four months ago, and is already increased to nearly two thousand members, and is daily increasing ; was not that fifteen, sixteen, or eighteen hundred more than you had at the time
BOWER 10524 Did people attend the meetings who were not members 
BOWER 10526 Had you any meeting at which five husdred persons were got together, before the month of March, 1792
BOWER 10528 I observed, when you were examined, you said you had no intention to attack government; what did you mean that you had no intention to attack government; if government had attacked you, and dispersed you, what were you to do
BOWER 10530 Supposing government had attempted to disperse you
BOWER 10532 You do not know, you said, whether there wasany intentionatall aboutaltering the House of Lords, or about the House of Lords in any respect 
BOWER 10534 Then, after all you have stated to me of those resolutions, and those works you have before stated, you mean now to state that your idea was a mere reform by petition to parliament, and nothing more
BOWER 10536 Was Martin, the person who signed this, the last witness 
BOWER 10540 That is a leading question. 
BOWER 10549 Did that book, called the Patriot, come out about the same time as the newspaper 
BOWER 11183 You are stating certain facts wae do not appear upon the evidence you Offer. 
BOWER 11185 You state that, in fact, to be a proceeding in partewoent upon certain peUtions, which I say is not opening the evidence, unless you find it there. 
BOWER 11331 Notwithstanding we are now not only in a criminal case, but ina case which affects the life of the prisoner at the bar, I make no apology at all for troublin our Lordships with the few observations have to offer, because I not only am conscious that neither myself, nor any one gentleman, with whom I am associated in this prosecution, can possibly conceive the purpose of pressing any evidence against the prisoner which we do not think is competent evidence, but I am confident that there does not exist acreature, about whose opinion I am anxious, that can conceive such a purpose to enter into the heart of any of us. 
BOWER 11332 My lords I conceive that this case, capital as itis, is to be tried upon the same principles of evidence as all other cases are; and it is our duty, as counsel for the prosecution, to resist the admission of any evidence which we think not competently legal, as much asif we were trying a common action of assault and battery, or as if a question could arise upon any subject that could possibly be -debated in acourt of justice, which imagination could conceive to be the most trifling. 
BOWER 11333 ‘Ihave always understood, that the declarations of parties are evidence only either in cases where they accompany the act at the time that they are made, or where they have been made at different times, and under different circumstances, totally unconnected with that fact, which is the question under discussion in the Court, in which cases they have always been received in the nature of facts, or rather as circumstances by which the general conduct of the party is to be judged of, as being circumstances, and being declarations given upon subjects to answer no particular purpose, and not connected with that which is the subject matter of discussion at the time that the evidence is given. 
BOWER 11334 Every case my friend, Mr. Erskine, bas cited, in my opinion, confirms the principle I am now stating; andif your lordship will examine them, one by one, you will find that in every case, which he has stated, where evidence of this kind has been received, it has been to show the general conduct and character of the prisoner, in circumstances and upon occasions no way connected with the crime of which he was then accused, but as circumstances and declarations in situations from which the jury might collect the general character and conduct oF the prisoner. 
BOWER 11335 It is indisputably true, that in the case of murder, evidence has always been received that the prisoner has at other times, upon other occasions, and in different circumstances shown acts of kindness to the deceased, and expressed himself kindly towards him, and they are offercd to show that that was the general disposition of the prisoner towards the deceased, from which the jury may collect that it could not be his intention to commit the crime which was imputed to him; but did any man alive ever hear it asked of a witness, produced in a case of that kind, whether he had heard the prisoner say, that he had No intention to kill the deceased ; and that that should be received as evidence, to explain the acts which were proved against the prisoner, upon the evidence given; and upon which the judgment of the Court and jury are to be drawn? 
BOWER 11336 In Holt’s case, which my learned friend has cited, in which he has admitted that the judgment of the Court of King’s-bench, went slong with the opinion of a learned, and most worthy judge, deceased—it appears that the judges were unanimous in thinking, when the fact was proved that the libel was published, that it was not competent to the defendant to explain his conduct, to state how, or in imitation of whom it was, that he had done that act which was then attributed to him as a crime. 
BOWER 11337 Inlord George Gordon’s case, the declarations there received, come under the other Principle, they were properly received, because all of them were declarations immediately preceding or following the act, so as to be considered as accompanying the acts of the moment—they were reccived upon the principle that declarations accompanying a fact, are a part of the fact itself; and that therefore you must receive them as circumstances of the fact; but there were neither received in evidence, nor offered, the private declarations made by that noble lord, previous to the time when he entered into that levying war, which constituted the crime of which he was accused. 
BOWER 11338 In the other case, which Mr. Erskine has stated, where the prisoner was permitted to ask what a person had heard him disclose ; that is on the principle of going to the general conduct—it was not with an intent to show that particular act, which is attributed as a crime in the prisoner, but to show that in former acts, which were considered as a part of bjs general conduct, the prisoner's disposition 
BOWER 11339 [tee was such and such upon certain subjects, nt connected immediately, not apologizing fr, and not offered as explanatory of the transactions which made the subject matter of the crime, with which he was ig ig 
BOWER 11340 In lord Russell’s case, when Dr. Borne was asked to a conversation of lord Russelfs against risings, which comes nearer than any my friend has stated, to the principle he wants to support—lIs it stated in that case, that my declaration lord Russell had made with respet to his intention, as to the rising in questea, or the facts that he was called to answer to was received as evidence—nothing like itwhen aman is charged with a particular rsing, which constitutes the particular fact o which he is accused, evidence of his genml conduct, and general character, d H of other facts, and other circumstancesare of fered to prove—not what he said respecting the fact there—but as general evidence of the conduct and intention of the party. 
BOWER 11341 As to Rosewell’s case, which was, that clergyman who had taken occasion to inst the government, had at other times preached sermons in favour of government, that coms within both principles ; the preaching a di course in favour of government at another time, is an act done strongly indicative of the intentions, and general conduct of the prisoner, to show that he was well disposed we wards povethiaent, and I give my learned friend leave, if he can in this instance, prove five hundred acts, to show that Mr. Hardy has always supported government, aot hasin his general conduct, done acts a3 D torious as the preaching of'a sermon in ap port of order, and good government. 
BOWER 11342 The case a sir ze Freind was of the same kind; the evidence was not to prow what he had done respecting the particur transaction, but to show that at differst times, when there could be no design in ve", the conversation not respecting the crime which he was then accused, sir John Freint had been speaking of government in the "J that a dutiful subject ought todo. 
BOWER 11343 In Dammaree's case, the declarations 1 ceived were directly accompanying the st: the declarations of the mob were received 35 part of the act, and upon that principle oaly. 
BOWER 11344 The case last alluded to was, I believe, Crhagan’s case, in which was given in evi against him, his declarations of coming England, to kill the king ; and his coming England coupled with other acts, to what his intention was; and there was declaration to explain the particujar act, which he at that time was accused, or which was then the subject matter of inquiry. 
BOWER 11345 ; I have before stated j om which 4 
BOWER 11346 learned friend Mr. Gi cently, and as he always does, very abl bl to expressious of good will, that is 14 which I do not deny, but the applicsto which I dispute, because I say that these & 
BOWER 11347 pressions of good will, are only received i the way that I have before stated, namely, that they are expressions at other times, upon occasions, when there is no crime imputed, when they cannot be possibly supposed to have relation to any crime, not then committed, or about to be committed, and which only shows a general good disposition— which in an equivocal act might make it doubtful, whether the party was actuated by malice toward the deceased, or not. 
BOWER 11348 But the evidence offered in this case, is of a very different complexion indecd, and such as I 
BOWER 11349 ly speak truly when I say I do not recollect ever to have been offered to a court of justice. The crime charged is, compassing the king’s death—we can give no evidence of the manner of compassing the death of the king, but by the overt acts which we have charged, and therefore the subsiance of the indictment is, that you did this overt act, from which this compassing necessarily arises; it is the act I admit to show the intent, which is just like any other fact, in any other case; it is just the same, as when we say a man committed a homicide with a felonious intent; the intent is a part of the crime—but was it ever asked, whether he had said he committed that crime, with a felonious intent
