MARTIN 10121 It was a proposal 2 the comiittec.

MARTIN 10128 No farther than what appeared in the public newspapers. What newspapers are you speaking of —

MARTIN 10135 Not altogether. 
MARTIN 10137 P articularly that part relating to a secret committee. it? you a secret committee at Sheffield ?—No. 
MARTIN 10139 No, nothing of the kind was ever entertained. 
MARTIN 10141 I was at partofthe meeting; at only the latter part of the meeting. 
MARTIN 10143 I was at the outside of the people, and thercfore could not hear the proceedings. 
MARTIN 10145 Perhaps I might. 
MARTIN 10147 I do.

MARTIN 10151 I frequently have heard him speak in private, and in public. 
MARTIN 10153 I cannot say I was very intimate. 
MARTIN 10155  I was. 
MARTIN 10157 I cannot say we had altogether. 
MARTIN 10159 I cannot recollect exactly ; with respect to a reform in parliament, we differed in many other circumstances respecting political matters, but with respect to the specific difference I cannot at nt recollect. 
MARTIN 10161 I do not. 
MARTIN 10163 I do not. 
MARTIN 10165 No, I never did, only what public report has said; I never heard who were but merely by public rumour. 
MARTIN 10167 I have heard it said that certain pers sons were editors of the Patriot. 
MARTIN 10169 Mr. Brown was mentioned as one person. 
MARTIN 10171 I believe I do. 
MARTIN 10173 He was. 
MARTIN 10175 W e believed so. Do youremember your society having any communication with a society at Steckport ?—I etters have occasiunally passed. 
MARTIN 10177 I have seen some letters, but do not particularly recollect any of them. 
MARTIN 10179 We believed so. 
MARTIN 10181 I believe it is. 
MARTIN 10183 Yes. 
MARTIN 10185 I was not. 
MARTIN 10187 I know it by seeing it mentioned in the public papers. 
MARTIN 10189 I have heard it spoken of generally among people that they supposed so. 
MARTIN 10191 I did not. 
MARTIN 10193 I belicve so. 
MARTIN 10195 I understood the not petitioning parliament, applicd to the present parliament, the present House of Commons. 
MARTIN 10197 By no means. 
MARTIN 10199 They certainly did. 
MARTIN 10201 I would not. 
MARTIN 10204 They were. 
MARTIN 10206 Yes; the proceedings, including the principal part of Mr. Yorke’s speech. 
MARTIN 10208 The speech which was afterwards published. 
MARTIN 10210 Yes, I have seen it. 
MARTIN 10212 A plater. 
MARTIN 10214 Yes. 
MARTIN 10216 I am not a houseKeeper; I live with my father. 
MARTIN 10218 A grocer. 
MARTIN 10220 I was. 
MARTIN 10222 I think from the year 1791, to the present time. 
MARTIN 10224 Yes, I did. 
MARTIN 10226 I did in the general; I was not at every meeting. 
MARTIN 10228 Yes. What was your object ?—My object in joining the society was this; if by lawful and constitutional means, in co-operation with the rest of my brethren, we might be able to gain a reform in parliament. 
MARTIN 10230 We expected that our pe‘titions would be heard. 
MARTIN 10233 I did. 
MARTIN 10242 No, never. 
MARTIN 10245 I would not. 
MARTIN 10248 I was. 
MARTIN 10251 I 0 not recollect at present. 
MARTIN 10253 I do not know that the solution was, stating that parliament never be petitioned again. 
MARTIN 10255 I rather think it’ pasticulasly referred to thst time only. 
MARTIN 10257 Yes, I was. 
MARTIN 10259 I do not recollect. 
MARTIN 10262 He was. 
MARTIN 10264 It was ; I dare say our delegate would have been recalled from the convention, if any other object had been proposed 
MARTIN 10266 He was. 
MARTIN 10268 They were to point out the proper way of addressing parliament unknown to us. 
MARTIN 10270 Of addressing parliament in a constitutional way, that might not altogether be thought upon by us; we thought them persons more capable of judging of the most effectual way of addressing parliament than ourselves. 
MARTIN 10272 We supposed that petitions coming from so respectable a body as we thought them, would have considerable weight with parliament. 
MARTIN 10274 We did. 
MARTIN 10276 That was our ultimate expectation. 
MARTIN 10278 Not against the king. 
MARTIN 10280  Nothing against his title, or office, or life. 
MARTIN 10282 I do not particularly recollect whether there was or no. 
MARTIN 10284 I believe not. 
MARTIN 10287 Not long before. 
MARTIN 10289 Yes, I recollect very well, the society had very great apprehensions of danger from the opposite party, because the opposite party given them cause to fear, by their repeated threats to the society, and by the ill usage that some of the membersof the society had met with from them. 
MARTIN 10291 No, by no means the magistrates, but individuals, who took upon themselves an authority which we thought they had no right to. ; 
MARTIN 10293 It was complained of in the society, as a thing that was thought by the society not right. 
MARTIN 10295 I am sensible in whose presence I now stand, and I desire to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; and, in the presence of God, I can ay affirm, upon my oath, that that never was designed, never agitated, and, I believe, never thought of in the society, to arm as a body, to attack government. 
MARTIN 10297 I should. 
MARTIN 10299 I believe I should.
