ADAIR 1451 It is not on account Of the importance of this particular piece of evidence that I take the liberty of addressing a very few words to your lordships, upon the subject of the objection that has bcen made, but from an impression of the very great importance of the principle upon which this obJection may be decided, and the extensive application of it to other cases that may in future occur, 
ADAIR 1452 In order to understand the objection, it is necessary to state the ground upon which this evidence is offered: and I conceive that a reat part of the argument of my learned iend, who very ingeniously stated this objection at first, is answered by a cunsideration of the ground upon which this evidence is offered ; for I do not conceive, and I, for one, do not offer the evidence to the Court upon the ground, that the idle expressions of 
ADAIR 1453 Mr. Martin respecting the king,—that the relation of an accidental fact that happened im the Park, within Mr. Martin's knowledge, respecting the king, is any evidence at all against the prisoner; but it is upon this ground, that a part of that letter which we offer in evidence is alleged to relate, and your lordships, when it is read, will find that it does relate to an act done by the conspirators, as itis contended, in the furtherance and prosecution of that conspiracy which is by the indictment imputed to the prisoner. 
ADAIR 1455 It is a statement from one of the conspirators, who had been in the chair at the meeting of those whom we call the conspirators, held, as it has been alleged, for the purpose of furthering the views of that conspiracy—it is a statement of that conspirator to another person, alleged to be a conspirator, of what fees at that mecting, so held
ADAIR 1457 The grounds upon which this evidence ig offered to the Court, seem to me to fall directly within the principle of lord Stafford’s case; but, even f it eould be distinguished from other cases, I think it cannot be distinguished from the cases of Dammaree and lord 
ADAIR 1458 3eorge Gordon ; and the distinction that has been attempted between an act of violence, or any other act, in furtherance ofa conspiracy, FE confess I do not feel much the force of. — This comes so completely within the principle of lord George Gordon's case, that it is impossible, without holding that case net to be law, to reject this evidence. 
ADAIR 1459 Your lordships will pardon me for having made these observations ; it was merely from the importance of the principle, and not from the least idea that the letter, when read, will be thought to be very much in itself. 
ADAIR 1482 As my friend has done me the honour to advert more to what fell from me than the weight of it seemed to deserve, I heg leave to state and explain what I did say upon the subject. I did state, and I do not mean to retract it, that the part of the letter which I alluded to, when 1 spoke, was not the ground upon which we offered it to P ha lordships, and would not, of itself, Make that evidence against the prisoner; but I did never state, that if there was that in the letter, upon the ground of which I contended it was proper evidence, as applicable evidence to the charge against the prisoner, that the whole context of that letter should not be taken together, in order to show the intention of the parties who are implicated in that design. I have never admitted that. But his lordship has certainly truly said, that my admission does not preclude any other gentleman arguing upon that ground. I wished to repeat what it was that I did state, that I might not be accused of having admitted that which I never admitted.
