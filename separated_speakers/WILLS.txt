WILLS 9321 Soon atter 1 became a member of the Corresponding Society, I wished to be a members of the Constitutional Society from a wish to hear clever men speak, not having it in my power to go to the IJouse of Parliament, where I could have heard more clever men undoubtedly. 
WILLS 9324 You must judge whether they were clever speeches. 
WILLS 9326 I heard one or two, I thought clever speeches, 
WILLS 9328 I took my rule of politics from public report, and from the debates in both Houses of Parliament. 
WILLS 9330 I had not time in general to read the public papers.
