GRANT 731 It is different from the other hand-writing. I do not believe it to be his hand-writing.

GRANT 787 I am, sir, for the committee of thetheir names and residence, which are aa folLondon Corresponding Society, your very lows ; Mr. Isaac Saint, at the Weaver’s arms, humble servant, MOM. ch. St. Augustins, Norwich; Mr. Anthony Cad“ London 11th Oct. 1792. Gewould, cordwainer, near the Globe, ditto; o the Revolution Society at Norwich. George Knapp, near ditto. Our principal design, sir, in doing this, is, that we may have “ Derby Society for Political Information an opportunity of knowing more exactly what “ Mr. 8. Eyre may be thought the most eligible steps to be a’ a taken in carrying on this great business of our :London 19th Octr. 1792. associated brethren, and to have an opportu“Sis, With pleasure we acknowledge yournity to ask suck sort of questions ae may be thought very reasonable among the brethren, especially when we think that publications are covered with a sort of obscurity in its language, as the Sheffield peuple’s Declaration, which seemed determined to support the duke of Richmond’s plan only; but since we find in a printed letter received from them in a book, that they mean to abide by some moderate reform, as may hereafter be brought forward by the Friends of the People, which method is uncertain to us. Again we find that the Friends of the People and the Society for Constitutional Information do not exactly agree. We could be glad to know the reason ; it seems to me as though the difference was this—the Friends of the People mean only a partial reform; because they leave out the words expressing the duke of Richmond’s plan and talk only of a reform; while the Manchester peuple seem to intimate, by addressing Mr. Paine, as though they were intent upon republican principles only: now, to come closer to the main question, it is only desired to know whether the generality of the societies mean to rest satisfied with the duke of Richmond’s plan only; or, whether it is their Private design to rip up monarchy by the Toots, and eee democracy in its stead, I shall now, sir, give you an exact account of what plan we could wish to obtain, which I have already moved for at our general meeting, viz. a full and equal representation of the whole body of the people, a general suffrage of votes, and and annual parliaments. I remember the Society forConstitutional Information intimated to us that Mr. Basham used to write to them in the name of the Revolution Society; if you approve of that appellation, pray be so kind as to give us a full and satisfactory answer. I shall say no more at present, but remain a friend to peace, not to anarchy; a well-wisher to the rights of man when obtained by consent; and your most obedient and humble servant,

GRANT 875 No; I could not swear that, for I did not see any to the best of my recollection. 
GRANT 877 Yes. 
GRANT 879 Mr.. Hardy informed me that Carter had been taken up. You had given orders that these bills should be delivered to Carter ; were they in fact delivered out of your possession after they were returned from Hardy’s?—They were not delivered by my order to Carter.

GRANT 899 Yes: he said he had heard that I refused to print them.

GRANT 915 At Mr. Byde's. 
GRANT 917 Of the division. 
GRANT 919 Yes; I was there once. 
GRANT 921 There were a great many there ; I knew very few. 
GRANT 923 I believe it was the same society moved from the Bell to the Unicorn, the same society or the same division that was there, 
GRANT 927  So much for their assertions. 
GRANT 970 ce.
