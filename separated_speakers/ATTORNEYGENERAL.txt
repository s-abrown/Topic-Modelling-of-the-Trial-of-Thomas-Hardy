ATTORNEYGENERAL 1  May it please your Lordship and gentlemen of the Jury, In the course of stating what I have to offer to your must serious attention in this great and weighty cause, affecting, as it certainly does, the dearest interests of the community, affecting, as you will remember throughout this business, every interest which can be valuable to the prisoner at the bar, I shall have frequent occasion to call that anxious attention to the different parts of the indictment which has just been opened to you. 1 forbear to do so at this moment, because I think that attention will be more usefully, both with respect to the public, and to the prisoner, given and required in another part of what Iam to address to you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2 Gentlemen, the prisoner, who is before you, stands charged (to state the indictment generally) with the offence of compassing his majesty’s death; he was committed upon that charge by his majesty’s privy council: I will explain to you presently why I state this and the following facts. In consequence of the apprehension of this prisoner, of several others charged by this indictment, and of others whose names do not occur in this indictment, proceedings of some notoricty were had in parliament, and an act passed, empowering his majesty to detain such persons as he suspected were conspiring against his government. That act has asserted, that a traitorous and detestable conspiracy had been formed for subverting the existing laws and government of the country, and for introducing that system of anarchy and confusion, which had so fatally prevailed in France ; the act, upon the spur oft the emergency, which it contemplated, authorized the detention without bail, mainprize, or discharge, of the persons then in prison for high treason, or treasonable practices, or who should afterwards be committed, for high treason or treasonable practices, by warrants from the privy council or secretary of state, until the first of February, 1795. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3 Gentlemen, this ‘measure, which did not suspend the operation of the Habeas Corpus act, that great palladium of English liberty, but with reference to particular persons, under particular commitments, for particular offences, is a measure never adopted in this country by parliament but in cases, in which it is understood, after giving all possible atten tion to secure the right of the subject from being broken in upon, to be of the last possible necessity, and which has been repeatedly putin foree, in the best of times, in such cases, where the wisdom of parliament apprehended that it was matter of their duty to rovide that the nation should part with its iberty for a while, that it might not lose it for eraa entlemen, appearing before you this da: in discharge of Sardi, which I have beet commanded to execute and the execution of which appears to me to be absolutely necessary, you will collect from the fact that I do appear here this day, that, accordin, to the true constitutional meaning of suc an act of parliament, it is not that the trial of such persons shall be delayed during the period of the suspension of the act, but that the act shall, with reference to the time of trial, be allowed, in the right execution of it, an operation only to that extent in which the due consideration of the public safety, tempered with a due attention to the liberty of the individual subject, may require. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4 Gentlemen, the proceedings of the legislalature having been such as T have stated to you, his majesty, constitutionally advised in the exercise of his duty, as the great conservator of the public peace, directed a commission to issue to inquire whether any such treasons, as the presumption of such a traitorous conspiracy must necessarily suppose to have existed, had been committed by any persons, and by whom. In the execution of the duties of that commission, a grand jury of this county, upon their oaths, have declared that there is ground of charge against the person at the bar, and against others, sufficient to call upon them, ina trial to be had before you, their country, to answer tov an accusation of high treason, in compassing his majesty’s death. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5 Gentlemen, I have stated these circumstances, that I may convey to you, in as strong terms as I can express it, this observation, that, as the proccedings of parliament ought to have had (and I am persuaded, from the deliberation which they gave the subject, that they had) no influence upon the judicial mind of the grand inquest, ncither ought these proceedings to affect your inquiries, or to induce you to any determination, which you are to make upon the issue, which you are now sworn to try. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6 Gentlemen, there is no one circumstance of any proceedings before parliament, with reference to which you ought to suffer yourselves to be influenced in the trial of this issue. It is obvious that such proceedings, as were had in parliament, providing for great emergencies, may be required and authorized by the genuine spirit of the constitution, even in cases in which a grand jury might not, upon any thing that could be offered to their consideration, be justified in finding a bill: it is much more obvious, that, in a proceeding before you, a consideration of the wisdom and propriety of the acts of the legislature is not called for. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7 You therefore, gentlemen of the jury, will consider the prisoner as standing before you in full possession of an absolute right to the presumption of innocence, notwithstanding e is charged with guilt by this indictment, as you will hear, except so far as that presumption is met by the single simple fact, that he has been accused by a grand jury of his country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8 Gentlemen, before I conclude these generat observations, you will permit me to say, on the other hand, that, if there has been any thing that has fallen under your observation, by act or publication—any attempt to make 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9 ‘ any impression upon the minds of those who are this day impanelied to try this great cause, to disparage that advice, which, under the most responsible sanction, may be given you in matter of law, to work in your minds any prejudice either against the prisoner, or on the prisoner’s behalf; on the one hand I am perfectly sure that your integrity will be security to the public, that you will not permit any attempt of that kind to have any operation; on the other hand, gentlemen of the jury, Tam equally sure that I necd not ask from an English jury, that ane would permit no such attempt to prejudice them against the prisoner at the bar,—no, not even an injudicious or ill executed attempt, to influence them in his favour. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10 Gentlemen, in order to understand the law of treason, and the indictment, I shall take the liberty first to state to you the character which I apprehend the king, for the protection of whose person and government the statute in question was made, has in the State and constitution of this country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11 Gentlemen, the power of the state, by which I mean the power of making laws, and enforcing the execution of them when made, is vested in the king; enacting laws, in the one case, that is, in his legislative character, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords spiritual and temporal, and of the Commons in parliament assembled, assembled according to the law and constitutional custom of England; in the other case, executing the laws, when made, in subservience to the laws so made, and with the advice, which the law and the constitution have assigned to him in almost every instance, in which they have called upon him to act for the benefit of the subject. The king’s authority, under the check of constitutional and legal provisionsand limitations, convenes and regulates the duration and existence of parliament, convening those whom, according to the law and custom of the country, he is bound to convene. The king, in his parliament, sitting in his royal political capacity, and the Lords and Commons there assembled, form the great body politic of the kingdom, by which is exercised sovereign authority in legislation. gentlemen, whilst the present law, the present constitution, and present government of Great Britain, exist, no law can be made but by that authority ; no legislative power can be created against the will, andin defiance of that authority. Whether in any, or in what circumstances, an attempt to create such a power isa treason forbiden by the statute of the 25th of Edward Srd, I propose to examine presently. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 12 Gentlemen, as in the king the power of legislation is vested, as well as the executive power of the state, to be exercised with consent and advice, to be exercised according to those laws, which are the birthright and inheritance of the subject, having upon him the care and protection of the community ; to him, in return, the allegiance of every individual is, according to the law of England, due ; that allegiance, by which the subject is bound, in the Janguage of the statutes of this country, to defend him “ against all traitorous conspiracies and attempts whatsoever, which shall be made against his person, his crown, or his dignity. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 13 Gentlemen, to ascertain to whom this care and protection is committed—to ascertain to whom this allegiance is due, the breach of which, according to the venerable lord Hale, constitutes high treason, is necessary to the peace of the community—to ascertain and to define accurately what constitutes a breach of that allegiance, is essentially and absolutely necessary to the security of all that our ancestors have claimed, demanded, and insisted upon, as the ancient, undoubted rights and liberties of our country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 14 Gentlemen, the former of these ubjects is secured by the law and constitutional custom of England; that law which alike secures to you every right, whether it be a right of person or of property. It has made the crown, which his majesty wears, hereditary (and I beg your attention to that), subject to limi tation by parliament. The latter object has been most anxiously secured by the statute referred to in the indictment, which brings forward the charge, the truth of which you are now to try. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 15 Gentlemen, the king having this hereditary crown, the law and constitution have also ascertained his dutics—those duties, which it is incumbent upon him to execute, for the benefit of the subject, in the execution of which duties they have aided him with counsel, and in consideration of which duties they have clothed him with dignity, and vested him with high prerogatives. With respect to the duties of the king, they attach upon him the instant he becomes such; from the moment that his title accrues, in the same instant the duty of allegiance (the breach of which is high treason) attaches to it; he recognizes these as his duties in that oath, to which, throughout this business, I must again call your attention, in that cath which he is bound to take upon him, at bis coronation, by which he promises and swears “ to govern the people of this country, mark the words, gentlemen, “ according to the statutes in parliament agreed upon, and the laws and customs of the sume ; that to his power he will cause law in justice and mercy to be administered; that he will maintain the laws of God and the true profession of religion established by law. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 16 Gentlemen, this oath, stated by that great and venerable constitutional judge, Mr. Justice Foster, to be a solemn and a public recognition, not only of the duties of the king, but of the fundamental rights of the people, imposeth upon him (and throughoutthis case it cannot be too strongly recollected that it imposeth upon him) the most sacred obligation to govern according to the laws and statutes in parliament agreed upon, according to the laws and customs of the same, and no other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 17 Gentlemen, addressing this Court, which is a court of law, in which you, the jury, are sworn to make a true deliverance according to the law of England, can I impress it too strongly that it cannot be supposed by possibility—not by possibility—that the king can, consistently with his oath, and with the antecedent duty recognized in the explicit engagement, the terms of which you have heard, either act, or permit himself to act, as kin, according to any rules of government, forme: by any bodies of men, assuming any character, functions, or situations, those rules of government being meant to operate as laws, the statutes agreed upon in parliament, and the duws and customs of the same, only excepted ? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 18 Gentlemen, it seems to me to follow, as a necessary conclusion from the reasoning to be addressed to a court of law, not only that those, who conspire to remove the king out of the government altogether, but that those who conspire to remove him, unless he will govern the people according to laws, which are not statutes in parliament agreed upon, and the laws and customs of the same, or as the head of a government framed and modified by any authority not derived from that parliament, do conspire to depose him from that royal state, title, power, and government, which the indictment mentions, and to subvert and alter the rule and government now established in these kingdoms. He ought not so to govern—I say he cannot so govern—he is bound to resist such a project at the hazard of all its consequences; he must resist the attempt; resistance necessarily produces deposition, it endangers his life. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 19 Gentlemen, to that king, upon whom these duties attach, the law and constitution, for the better execution of them, have assigned various counsellors, and responsible advisers : they have clothed him, under various constitutional checks and restrictions, with various attributes and prerogatives, as necessary for the support and maintenance of the civil liberties of the people: they ascribe to him sovereignty, imperial dignity, and perfection : and because the rule and government, as established in this kingdom, cannot exist for a moment without a person filling that office, and able to execute all the duties from time to time, which I have now stated, they ascribe to him also that he never ceases to exist.. In foreign affairs, the delegate and representative of his people, he makes war and peace, leagues and treaties: In domestic concerns, he has prerogatives, as a constituent part of the supreme Tegislature ; the prerogative of raising fleets and armies: he is the fountain of justice, bound to administer it to his people, because it is due to them; the great conservator of public peace, bound to maintain and vindicate it; every where present, that these duties may no where fail of being discharged; the fountain of honour, oflice, and privilege ; the arbiter of domestic commerce, the head of the national church. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 20 Gentlemen, I hope I shall not be thought to mispend your time in stating thus much, because it appears to me that the fact, that such is the character, that such are the duties, that such are the attributes and prerogatives of the king in this country (all existing for the protection, security, and happiness of the people in an established form of governmen}), accounts for the just anxiety, bordering upon jealousy, with which the law watches over his person—accounts for the fact that, in every indictment, the compassing or imagining his destruction, or deposition, seems to be considered as necessarily co-existing with an intention to subvert the rule and government established in the country: it is a purpose to destroy and to depose Aim, in whom the supreme power, rule, and government, under constitutional checks and limitations, is vested, and by whom, with consent and advice in some cases, and with advice in all cases, the exercise of this constitutional power is to be carried on. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 21 Gentlemen, this language, the tenor and charge of every indictment, is most clearly expressed by lord Hale, when he says that high treason is an offence more immediately against the person and gorernment of the king: I cannot state it more strongly to you, or from an authority, the authenticity of which will be less questioned by those who are to defend the prisoner at the bar, than when I state to you the language of one of the counsel for lord George Gordon upon the last trial for high treason: indeed itis no more than what follows the law of England as delivered by all those great lawyers, whosc authority, I am persuaded, will not be attempted to be shaken in the course of this trial, when it states this principle thus : o compass or imagine the death of the king, such imagination or purpose of the mind, visible only to its great Author, being manifested by some open act, an institution obviously directed not only to the security of his natural person, but to the stability of the government, the life of the prince being so Interwoven with the constitution of the state that an attempt to destroy the one is justly held to be a rebellious conspiracy against the other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 22 Gentlemen, it will be my duty to state to you presently what is in law an attempt against the life of the king. It seems, therefore, that when the ancient law of England, —and I would beg your attention to what I am now stating to you,—that when the ancient law of England was changed, which, even in the case of a subject, held the intent to kill homicide, as well as, in the case of the king, the intent to kill or depose, without the fact, where a measure was taken to effectuate the intent, treason, with a difference however as to the nature of the acts deemed sufficient, in the one case, or in the other, to manifest the one or the other intent, that to use the words of a great and venerable authonity, I mean Mr. Justice Foster, “ it was with great propricty that the statute of treason retained the rigour of the law in its full extent in the case of the king. In the case of him, says he, “ whose life must not be endangered, because it cannot be taken away by treasonable practices, without involving a nation in blood and confusion: levelled at him, the stroke is levelled at the public tranquillity. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 23 Gentlemen, that it may be fully understood what it is that I have to contend for in the course of this trial, I put you in mind again that I have before stated, that, as it is absolutely necessary to the security of individuals, Notless necessary to the security of individuals, than it is necessary to the security of the nation which they compese, that the person and government of the king should be thus defended ; on the other Pie i for the security of the subject, it is equally necessary that the crime of high treason should not be indeterminate, that it should not be unascertained, or undefined, either in the law itself, or in the construction to be made of that law. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 24 Gentlemen, this necessity is not to be collected merely in this country from reasoning, though it may obviously enough be collected from reasoning ; the experience of your ancestors has informed you, I admit it, and I beg to press it upon your attention, as much as any man in this court can press it upon your attention, the experience of your ancestors has informed you, in the just and bitter complaints which are to be found in thcir annals, of the periods, in which no man knew how he ought to behave himself, todo, speak, or say, for doubt of pains of treason,—in the anxiety with which the statute of Edward Srd reserved the judgment of all treasons not there expressly specified—“ that the justices should tarry without going to judgment of the treason, till the cause be showed and declared before the king and his pannel ;—in the expressive language, which your ancestors have used, when the provisions of the statute of Edward were first introduced into the code of law under which we live, and of those statutes, by which treasons were brought back to the provisions of that statute, the experience of your ancestors, thus handed down to you, has demonstrated this necessity. I admit too (and my treating the subject thus in the outset may ultimately save your bathe that before the statute was made, upon whic! the indictment proceeds, the security of the subject was not sufficiently provided for. I admit that security is not sufficiently provided for now, if construction can be allowed to give an exposition to the statute, which the legislature did not intend it should receive. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 25 Gentlemen, upon each of these heads it was necessary for me to trouble you with some, and but with a few observations. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 26 That the law of treason should be determinate and certain, though clearly necessary for the security of the subject, is not more necessary for their security, than that there should be a law of treason, and that this law should be faithfully, duly, and firmly executed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 27 Gentlemen, every state must have some form or regimen of government; in other words, it must determine by whom, and under what modifications, the sovereign power is to be exercised in the country; tor no government can exist, unless this power is placed somewhere: and the attempt to subvert that power is, in the nature of the thing, an attempt to subvert the established government. It is of necessity that an attempt of this sort should be guarded against, by severer penalties than offences, which being breaches of particular laws, do not endanger the very existence of the state itself, which do not involve, in the destruction of the state, the destruction of all laws, but which leave the law, though violated in particular cases, sufficient, in general cases, for the protection of the personal security, the liberty, and happiness of the subject. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 28 Gentlemen, this is also the reasoning of that great judge, whose name I before mentioned to you, my lord Hale : “ The greatness of the offence, he says, “and the severity of the punishment, is upon these reasons: First, because the safety, peace, and tranquillity of the kingdom is highly concerned in the safety and preservation of the person, dignity, and government of the king, and therefore the laws of the kingdom have given all possible security to the king’s person and government, and under the severest penalties. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 29 Gentlemen, to describe this great offence with precision and accuracy, was what the legislature in Edward's time proposed, when they enacted the sacred statute upon which this indictment is founded; that statute was made for the more precise definition of this crime, which, by the common law, had not been sufficiently extended, and “ the plain anextended letter of it, you will mark the words, “ the plain unextended letter of it was thought to be a sufficient protection to the person and honour of the sovereign; but not only to the person and honour of the sovereign, but “ an adequate security to the laws committed to his execution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 30 Gentlemen, in addressing a jury if a court of law, sworn to make deliverance according to that law which constitutes the court in which they sit, there are two propositions, which appear to nf to be alike clear: the first is, that I ought not, that I cannot dare to call upon you to say, that there has been committed under this statute any offence, if the facts of the case to be laid before you, by plain, manifest, authorized interpretation of the statute, do not constitute an offence under it; if the statute should seem to any man, or to you, not to be a sufficient and adequate security to the person and honour of the sovereign, and the due execution of the laws, it is nevertheless all the security which the law has authorized you to give them, and God forbid that you should think of giving more. On the other hand, you are bound by your oaths, if this law has been violated in fact, if the fact of violation is proved by evidence, convincing in its nature, and such in its form as the law requires (for the law in this case requires not only convincing, but formal cvidence), then you are bound to give to the person and honour of the sovereign, and to the laws of your country, that protection, which a verdict, asserting in substance that the statute has been violated, would give, and which the statute intended should be given. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 31 Gentlemen, men of honour and of conscience, acting under the sanction of the oath which they have taken, must come to the same conclusion, judging of the same facts, by the same law, whatever their principles of government may be, unless they differ upon the effect of the tacts laid before them. In the trial of a person, whose name I shall have abundant reason to mention to you in the course of this proceeding, I mean the author of the Rights of Man, charged with a libel against the monarchy of the country, it was judiciously, truly, justly, and strongly adMnitted in effect, that, if the jury had been composed (if there are twelve such men in this country) of republicans, wishing to overturn the government of the country, yet administering the law of England, in a court of English law, if they were convinced that the crime had, according to that law, been committed, no man would have the audacity to say that they. could be capable of that crime against the public, to think for a moment of not coming to the conclusion, which the facts called for, according to the law by which they were sworn to decide upon the matter before them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 32 Gentlemen, the statute upon which this indictment proceeds, is to the following effect : —it states (and it states most truly), “ that divers opinions had been had before this time, that is, the 25th Edward Srd, “ in what case treason should be said, and in what not : the king, at the request of the Lords and of the Commons, hath made a declaration in the manner as hereafter followeth, that is to say, when a man doth compass or imagine the death of our lord the king, or of our lady his queen, or of their eldest son and heir; or ifa man do violate the king’s companion, or the king’s eldest daughter, upmarricd, or the wife of the king’s eldest son and heir ; or if a man do levy war against our lord the king in his tealm, or be adherent to the king’s enemies in his realm, giving to them aid and comfort in the realm or elsewhere, and thereof be provably attainted—by which words I understand be attainted by evidence, that clearly and forcibly satisfies the minds and consciences of those who are to try the fact— “attainted of open deed by people of their condition,—then there is this, to which you will be bound to give your attention for the sake of the prisoner, as well as for the sake of the public, the interests of both being blended in this great cause; “ and because that many other like cases of treason may happen in time to come, which a man cannot think nor declare at this present time, it is accorded that, if any other case, supposed treason, which is not above specified, doth happen before any justices, the justices shall tarry without any going to judgment of the treason till the cause be showed and declared before the king and his parliament, whether it ought to he judged treason, or other felony. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 33 Gentlemen, I desire to point out here, in the most marked way in which I can state it, the anxiety, with which the parliament wished to preserve to itself the judgments of treasons, not being the specified treasons in the statute, but being like treasons, those which, by a parity of reasoning. might be said to be treason. They would not trust the subjects of the country in the hand of any court of justice upon that point I mark the circumstance, because it appears to me to give a degree of authority to the law of England upon the subject of treason, and to the constructions, which have been made upon it, and to the distinctions, which have been made between like treasons, and overt acts of the same treason, that perhaps does not belong to constructions and distinctions adopted in the course of judicial proceedings upon any other law in the statute-book. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 34 Gentlemen, having read the statute to you, it is not unimportant, as it seems to me, to observe that lord Hale and Mr. Justice Foster, who have stated the judicial and other expoweighty caution, which they most powerfull express: under the solemn protests, whic! they most strongly state, against extending this statute by a parity of reason. This circumstance alone appears to me to give infinite authenticity to the expositions, which they state of it, as sound, and as being such as, according to the interpretation, which the legislature in Edward Srd‘s time meant, should be put upon this statute. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 35 Gentlemen, I think it may also save your time, and that of the Court, if I trouble you here by reading, before I state to you the expositions of the statute which lord Hale has given us, deducing them from judgments which had been actually made in the history of the country, the language which he holds, as describing the obligations, which courts of justice, and men looking at this statute for the purpose of executing it, are under, to construe it according to the real specified meaning, not by a parity of construction as to the treason itself, when they came to construe it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 36 Lord Hale states it thus : “ Although the crime of high treason is the greatest crime against faith, duty, and human society, and brings with it the greatest and most fatal dangers tu the government, peace, and happiness of a kingdom or state, and therefore is deservedly branded with the highest ignominy, and subjected to the greatest penalties t the law can inflict, yet by these instances —he is stating those that had occurred before the statute of Edward Srd and between that and the first of Henry 4th—“ yet by these instances, and more of this kind that might be given, it appears—first, how necessary it was that there should be some fixed and settled dary for this great crime of treason, and of what great importance the statute of the 25th of Edward 3rd. was in order. to that end; secondly, how dangerous it is to depart from the letter of that statute, and to multiply and enhance crimes into treason by ambiguous and general words—as accroaching of royal power, subverting of fundamental laws, and the like; and thirdly, how dangerous it is by construction and analogy to make treasons, where the letter of the Law has not done it, for such a method admits of no limits or bounds, but runs as far as the wit and invention of accusers, and the odiousness and detestation of persons accused, will carry men. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 37 In another passage, after having given his comment upon this statute—after havin; stated what are the overt acts, which fa witbin the letter of it, and the sound interpretation of it, he says, “It has been the great wisdom and care of the parliament to Eoep judges within the bounds and express limits of this act, and not to suffer them to run out upon their own opinions into constructive treasons, though in cases that seem to have a parity of reason (like cases of treason), but reserves them to the decision of pare liament. This is a great security as well as direction to judges, and a great safeguard even to this sacred act itself; and therefore, as before I observed, in the chapter of levying of war, this clause of the statute leaves a weighty memento for judges to be carcful that they be not over-hasty in letting in constructive or interpretative treasons, not within the letter of the law, at least in such new cases as have not been formerly expressly resolved, and settled by mere than one precedent. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 38 Gentlemen of the jury, Iam persuaded, as those were persuaded who conducted the defence of lord George Gordon, that we live in days, in which the judges of the country neither have the inclination nor the courage to stretch the law beyond its limits. I think myself bound to state that; and those, who dare to state the contrary in any place, do not do the justice to the country, which is due from every individual in it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 39 Gentlemen, having stated thus much to you, I now state, in order to be perfectly understood, that I do most distinctly disavow making any charge of constructive treason ; that Ido most distinctly disavow stating in this indictment any like case of treason not specified in the statute; that I do most distinctly disavow stating any thing that can be called cumulative treason or analogous treason ; thatI do most distinctly disavow enhancing any thing, by a parity of reason, into treason, which is not specified in that statute ; that I do most distinctly disavow enhancing crimes of any kind, or a life spent in crimes, if you choose so to put it, into treason, if it be not treason specified in the statute ; and the question between us I state distinctly to he this— Whether the defendant is guilty of a treason specified in the statute, and whether the evilence that is to be brought before you amounts to that proof, that will te satisfactory to your minds and consciences, your minds and consciences being prepared to admit no proof, but what you think you ought to reccive under the obligation of an oath, proof high enough that he may be “ provably attainted of open deed, of a treason specified in the statute, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 40 Then, gentlemen, to state the charge to you : The indictment charges the defendant with compassing and imagining the king’s death, and with having taken measures to effectuate that purpose — Now, that it may be thoroughly understood, you will permit me to state to you here, that there is not only a manifest distinction in reason, but a settled distinction in the course of judicial practice, settled for no other cause but that it was a manifest distinction in reason, between—“ like cases of treason, constructive, analogous, or cumulative treasons, and various overt acts of the same treason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 41 Gentlemen, whether the acts laid as overt acts of treason, specified in the statute, and specae! in the indictment, amount, in all eir circumstances, to an open deed, or deeds by which a ae may be provably attainted of the specified treason, is the question which ajury are to try. To explain myself upon this, I take it to be clear, and I will not, in this stage of the business at least, enter intothe discussion of what I call the clear and established law of England, hecause I will not in a case of high treason, any more than I would in a dispute about the estate of any gentleman who hears me, for the purpose of arguing points, enter into discussions upon what I take to be the clear and established law of England; and not only the security of the subject in this respect cannot, but the sesanto the subject in no respect, in his person, his life, or his property, can be taken to exist in this country, if I am not as fully authorized to state to you, with as much confidence, what the law Is, incase of treason, from the decisions, which for centuries have heen tnade in courts respecting it, as [am to state to you, from decisions of courts respectingproneny what the law of property is. I say, take it to be clear that deposing the king, entering into measures for deposing the king, conspiring with foreigners and others to inwade the kingdom, going to a foreign country to procure the invasion of the kingdom, or proposing to go there to that end, and taking any step in order thereto—conspiring to raise an insurrection, either to dethrone the king, imprison the king, or oblige him to alter his measures of government, orto compel him to remove evil counsellors from him, are, and have all been held, as Mr. Justice Foster says, to be deetls proving an intent to do that treason, which is mentioned in the statute to be overt acts of treason in compassing the king’s death, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 42 It would he very extraordinary if these great judges, Foster and Hale, after holding the language they have stated, were to be represented by any man, as not acting themselves under the effect and influence of that weighty memento, which they held out to those who “were to succecd them in the seat of judgment; yet I state all this to you in the words in which ‘these learned judges have handed down the exposition of the statute, who would have suffered death, for they both valued the liberties of their country, before they would have. charged “a like case of treason in an indictment; and yet they have concurred (as all the judges of England have done, and the parliament into the bargain) in the construction and exposition of the statute (and in fact executions have been made upon it), that all these things are overt acts of the same treason, that is specified in the statute. What is the reason of it? because the law holds that he, who does an act, meaning to do it, which may endanger the king’s lite, compasses and imagines the death of the king, if he does an act which may endanger his life, if im the ordinary course of things, and according to the common experience of mankind, the measure which he takes, in pursuance of a purpose to take it, will bring the king to his grave. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 43 This therefore is not raising constructive treason, it is not raising treason by analogy, it is not stating “ like cases of treason not specified in, but reserved by the statute to the judgment of parliament, but it is stating overt acts, which are measures taken in pursuance of treasonable purposes, which measures must necessarily be as various in their kinds, asthe ways and means, by which, in facts and open deeds, taken in pursuance of its purposes, the human heart manifests its intent to commit some one or other of the treasons specified in the statute. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 44 Gentlemen, the reserving clause in the act is extremely material; and, if courts and juries have done wrong in the manner in which they have executed this statute, if the inter. pretatons, which they have made of the statute, are not right, they have done it against a prohibition in the statute, which they were called upon by their oaths duly to expound, and they have done it in the presence and under the eye of that parliament, which had expressly forbidden them to doit. I say the conelusion upon that is, that they have done it rightly. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 45 Gentlemen, the judgments of the courts of law are in this country perfectly familiar to parliavent. Acts have been made, over and over agiin, in order to bring back the expositions of the Jaw to the true construction, to the letter, which is the true construction, in a ; sound Judicial sense, to bring it back againto the statute of Edward Srd; but we have lived to this hour without parliament thinking that they were tomake so perfectly a dead letter of the letter of the statute, as that they should say that an overt act, which expressed and inported the imagination of the mind to do the treason specified, should not be taken to be anact of high treason within the statute ; because the statute only mentions the thing which is to be compassed and imagined, and doc: not mention the ways and means, by whick the human heart may show and manifest that it does compass and imagine what thestatute speaks of. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 46 Gentlanen, this is not all, because this is not only iccording to the law of England, as itis admnistered in courts of justice, but also to the preceedings in parliament, which are a parliameatary exposition, if 1 may so state it, of the lav. Proceedings in parliament have been had where the statute has been thus construe, and where this distinction that I am statirg between overt acts of the specified treason and the “ like cases of treason, hasthe indictment lays the imagining and com. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 47 been expressly taken, expressly acted upon, proposed by one house of the legislature to the other house, and acted upon by the crown in executing the sentences of that house. Gentlemen, the distinction then is only this —“a like case of treason is a case of treason not specified in the statute, a case of the like mischief, as a case specified in the statute; but the identical case specified in the statute must be before yuu, or, to avoid all dispute upon the subject, I say, if it be a case that isnot specified in the statute, it is a case that must be shown to parliament according to the directions of the statute: but that facts alike in their nature, that open deeds alike in their nature and tendency, however various in their circumstances, may prove the same intention to exist in the minds of those who do them, and may be measures, taken in pursuance of the same purpose, and to effectuate the same thing, is a distinction that appears to my mind to be perfectly obvious. Gentlemen, I conccive, therefore, that the uestion of compassing the king’s death is this—whether the jury are fully satisticd, conscientiously satisfied, that they have that evidence, by which they find that the acts, laid as overt acts of compassing the particular specified treason mentioned in the indictment, were measures taken in pursuance of and to effectuate that treason, specified at once in the statute and in the indictment. Gentlemen, I protest for mysclf I am sorry to trouble you thus much at large by general reasoning, but you will find that it has an application, and a close application, to the ease. This is an important public cause, and therefore we should be thoroughly understood, I cannot understand what constructive overt actsmean, though I do understand constructive treasons. Levying war against the kng, not against his person, but against his roya. majesty, is constructive treason ; thatis, if menassemble together without any intent to do an act, which in the natural consequence of things will affect the king's life, such as pullingdown all prisons or houses of any other descristion, that is constructive treason, it being, by construction, as Mr. Justice Foster says, against the king’s royal majesty, not levied against his person : not one of the acts of a more flagitious kind, wilfully done or attempted to be ne, by which the king’s life may he in danger, but which are levelled against lis royal majesty; these have by construction been held to be treason: but even these he legislature has never considered as not atthorized by the letter of the statute ; these tley have permitted to be proceeded upon in the country as sound decisions and constructbns upon the act of parliament: many have teen convicted upon them; execution hath ollowed ; and no one hath ever doubted eithe: the law or the justice of these determinations. But, as to constructive overt acts of canpassing and imagining the death of the king, where passing as the offence, the overt act is not constructive, the step taken to effectuate it must be such an act, wiltully and deliberately done, as must satisfy the conscience of a jury that there was an intention, by deposing, or otherwise, tu put the king in circumstances, in which, according to the ordinary experience of mankind, his life would be in danger. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 48 Gentlemen, I have befure stated to you, for another purpose, various acts, which are overt acts of compassing the king’s death. I will repeat them shortly: “ Deposing him,—entering into measures to uepese him,—conspiring to imprison him,—which you observe is an act that may be done without an actual intent to put him to death—a man may conspire to imprison the king without an actual intent to put him to death, but you will find the reason why that is held to be compassing and imagining the death of the king, with the sanction of all times since this statute of Edward 3rd, and with the sanction of every species of judicial authority, which the country could give; “ to get his person into the power of conspirators. Why is all this treason? ‘ Because, says Mr. Justice Fuster, “ the care, which the law hath taken for the personal safety of the king, is not confined to actions or attempts of a more flagitious kind, such as attempts either to assassinate, or to poison, or other attempts, directly and immediately aiming at his life; it is extended to every thing, wilfully and deliberately done, or attempted, whereby his life may be endangered ; and therefore the entering ints measures for depusing, or imprisoning hira, or to get his persun into the power of the conspirators,—these offences are overt acts of treason within this branch of the statute; for experience hath shown that between the prisons and the graves of princes the distance is very small, and expericnce has not grown weaker upon this subject in modern times; offences which are not so personal as those already mentioned, have been, with great propriety, brought within the same rule, as having a tendency, though not so immediate, to the same fatal end. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 49 Lord Hale, upon this, says, “ Though the conspiracy be not immediately, and directly, and expressly the death of the king, but the conspiracy is of something that in all probability must induce it, and the overt act is of such a thing as must induce it, this is an overt act to prove the compassing of the king’sdeath. The instance he gives, as expository of his text, is this; “If men conspire to imprison the king by force and a strong hand till he hath yielded to certain demands, and for that purpose gather company, or write letters, this is an overt act to prove the compassing of the king's death. What is the reason? he gives the same in substance, though different in the terms of it, as that which has been assigned by Mr. Justice Foster: “ for it is in effect to despoil him of his kingly government. These are the words of lord Hale; and though the reasons given by lord Ilale and Mr. Justice Foster are ditterent in words, they are the same in substance. It may be said, with equal truth, between despoiling a king of his kingly government and the graves of kings the distance is very small. Imprisonment is the same as deposition, and he whu compasses thedeposition of the king, according to all judicial construction, compasses his death; it is ; the same as deposition, because it is a temporary despoiling him of his kingly government, which, according to this interpretation of the ; law, usually ends in death. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 50 Gentlemen, offences not so personal as those enumerated fall within the same rule, as having a tendency to the same fatal end: if foreigners are not at war with you, the offence of guing into a forcign country, or propusing to go there, or taking any step thereto in order to invite foreigners into this kingdui for a treasonable purpose, can only tall within that branch of treason of compassingthe king's death ; if they are at war with you, then the same act amounts to another species of treason, which is an “adhering to the King’s enemies ; and perhaps you will find that the case I have to state is not without pregnant evidence of this species of overt act. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 51 Gentlemen, haying stated thus much to you, I proceed now to consider the indictment; and what I have stated, before I mentioned the substance of the indictment, I have stated to lay in my claim to full credit with you, whenIsay, that no man living can wish to express to you more strongly ! than I wish to do (we have indced, each of us, as great an interest in the true construction of this law, as any other man can have in it), that the law of treason, in considering the charge, that I have brought before you under the command that has authorized me to bring it here, must not be extended one single iota beyond what is the established law in this country, as established as the law is, that says that the property that you bought yesterday, you may give to whom you lease to-morrow. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 52 Gentlemen, the indictment, finding several persons entitled to be tried separately, though Indicted jointly, combined ina particular act, which I will state by-and-hy, has charged them with compassing the king’s death: it has then proceeded, because the compassing and imagination of the heart cannot be known to man—and there must be an overt act to manifest it—it bas charged them with meeting among themselves to cause and procure a convention of divers subjects of the king, to be held within this kingdom, and not only a eonvention to be held within the Kingdom, but to be held with intent and in order that the persons to be assembled at such convention and meeting should and might, wickedly and traitorously, without and in defiance of the authority, and against the will of lhe parliament of this kingdom, subvert and alter the legislature, rule, and goocrnment established in it, and depose the king from the royal state, title, power, and gocernment thereof. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 53 It then charges them with having composed, written, and published, and caused to e composed, written, and published, divers books, pamphlets, letters, instructions, resolutions, orders, declarations, addresses and writings, such books, pamphlets, letters, instructions, resulutions, orders, declarations, addresses and writings, su respectively composed, written, published, and caused to be composed, written, and published, purporting and containing therein (among other things) incitements, encouragements, and exhortations, to move, induce, and persuade the subjects of the king tochoose, depute, and send persons, as delegates, to cumpose, not a convention, but SUCH a convention and mcecting, that is, a convention to act in the manner that the first overt act has stated it, to be holden for the traie torous purposes befure mentioned. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 54 It then states, as a third overt act, consultations among them, how, when, and where, such convention and meeting should be assembled and held, and by what means the subjects of the king might be induced and moved to send persons as delegates to constitute it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 55 It then charges, that these persons did consent and agree, that Mr. Jovce and several other persons named, should meet, confer, and co-operate among themselves and with other traitors, to cause the calling and assembling such convention and meeting for such traitorous purposes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 56 It then charges the providing of arms, of different descriptions, fur these purposes; and then it charges a conspiracy to make war in the kingdom, anditchargesaconspiracy to subvert and alter the legislature aud government of the kingdom, and to depose the king: that is, as I understand it, that, if you should not be satisfied that the calling such a convention, as is mentioned in the first part of the indictment, was a mean to effectuate that compassing and imagination, which is mentioned tn the introductory part of the indictment, yet you will tind in the evidence, which is to be laid before you, even if yor pay no‘attention to that circumstance of calling a convene tion, sutticient evidence of a conspiracy to depose the king. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 57 It then states again, that they published several books, and other matters of the same kind, in order to bring about the traitcruas purposes Jast mentioned ; and charges, as a farther overt act, providing arms fur that purpose. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 58 Now, gentlemen, having before stated to you, that a conspiracy to depose the king,— 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 59 and I have not stated it to you in my own words, but in the words of the authorities I mentioned,—that a conspiracy to depose the king, that a conspiracy to imprison the king, a conspiracy to procure an invasion, with steps taken to effectuate such a conspiracy (a conspiracy indeed itself being a step for that purpose), is treason; you will observe that In this indictment, a conspiracy to depose the king is expressly charged, and, think, it will be clearly proved. If a conspiracy to depose the king be an overt act of high treason, permit me then to ask you, what can a conspiTacy to subvert the monarchy of the country, including in it the deposition of the king, be, but an overtact of high treason? In the object of such a conspiracy the king is necessarily involved, and it is already shown that conspiring to depose him is compassing his death. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 60 Gentlemen, read as you are in the history of the country, give me leave to ask you, if measures had been taken, after the Revolution, to effectuate a conspiracy to dethrone king William, and to restore king James, without all doubt, the measure taken, would have constituted the crime of high treason within the clause of compassing the king’s death, although the conspirators could have been shown satistactorily to have no more meant the actual natural death of king William, than they meant the actual natural death of king James, whom they intended to replace upon the throne—but what says the law to that; the law says you cannot mean to depose the king without meaning to endanger his life, and if you mean to endanger his life you must abide the consequences of it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 61 Put it another way—lIf the project had been to depose the same king William, and measures had been taken upon it—not witha view to bring back to the throne king James 2d, but merely to send back king William to his former character of Prince of Orange, and not to restore king James, but to restore a commonwealth, which is what, I think I shall satisfy you, those, who are charged by this indictment, meant by “a full and fair representation of the people, whether you eall it “ a full and fair representation of the people in parliament, or do not use the words “in parliament, can a lawyer be found to say, that it could be stated in law, that it is not high treason? I do not know what may not be stated—all that I mean to say at present is, that according to the best lights which I can get of the law under which —I have lived, it does not appear to me to be probable, that any man will so state it. Far be it from me, however, to have the vanity to say that (avowing that I should certainly not think of encountering the current authorities of the country for centuries) I am, without the possibWity of contradiction, stating that I am following the authorities of the country for centuries ; but I am ready to say this, that I cannot conceive or imagine by what species of teasoning, or upon what principle, or upon what authority, it is to be contended, that this would not have been high treason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 62 Gentlemen, take it another way—if the regicides ef king Charles 1st had been tried for compassing the death of king Charles 1st, supposing they had only deposed him, instead of putting him to death, could they have contended, that though they would have been guilty of high treason if they had placed another individual upon the throne (which would have been alike to the case I have put, of conspiring to put James in the bps of Wil liam), could they have contended then, that they were not guilty of high treason, because they deposed the king without substituting another king in his place; and because they left the governmentto be filled up by the commonwealth, without a king? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 63 Give me leave to ask another thing—suppose it had happened after king William came to the throne, that not those events, which did actually happen, took place, but that any set of men in this country should have ventured to meet in a convention of delegates from aftiliated societies, for the purpose of deposing king William, under pretence of assembling a convention of the people, havi: or claiming the civil and political authority of the country, and intending to have no king in the country, would it have been possible in king William’s time to have contended, because they met, under pretence of being a convention ef the people, assuming to themselves civil and political authority, and with such meaning, that the conspiracy was not as completely a cempassing the death of king William, as if the conspiracy had been, by the same persons, in the case of affiliated soc eties, forming the like convention of delegates, to bring king James again to the throne? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 64 If I levy war in this country against the king, with intent to bring another upon the throne, 1 am guilty of high treason. IfI levy war, that is an overt act of compassing the king’s death. If I conspire to levy direct war that is a compassing of the king’s death, um less all the branches of the legislature have puta man to death upon anerror. If I hold a fortress against the king to put another upon his throne, I am guilty of high treason. Am I guilty of no offence if I do the same acts not for the!purpose of continuing the monarchy of the country in another person, but for the purpose of destroying the monarchy altogether? What is this but doing an act involving in it high treason, and more? High treason in depusing the king! more—in bringing about all that additional anarchy, which we know, which the experience of mankind Proves to be consequent upon the change, where the change is not only of the persons who administer the government, but of the government itself, if destruction can be called a change? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 65 Gentlemen, to assert therefore that measures, taken for a total subversion of the monarchy of the country, including in it an intention to depose the king (mark the words, I state, including in it an intention to depose the king), are not overt acts of compassing the king's death, merely because the statute of Edward 3rd, has not included all overt acts in words, but as left to juries to determine what are overt acts, by which they can pruvahly attaint—to assert that the statute does not include the case, because it is compassing the death of the king, and more; if this were to be asserted ina court of justice (what is asserted out of a court of justice no man pays much attention to),should certainly say of it, that it was the assertion of those who had ill considered the law; and if asserted out of a court of justice, and with a reference to what isto be done in a court of justice, I should say it deserved to have an observation of a harsher kind made upon it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 66 This indictment, besides charging a conspiracy to depose the king, in express terms, of which I shall insist before you there is abundant evidence, charges a cunspiracy to call a convention against the will, in defiance of, and against the authority of parliament, for the purpose of deposing the king ; it charges farther acts, namely, that they caused to be composed and written divers books, pamphlets, letters, instructions, resolutions, orders, declarations, addresses, and writings, cuntaining incitements, inducements, and exhortations, to move, seduce, and persuade the subjects of the king to send delegates to such convention ; as to whichIsay of many of them, though I did not know their real character till 1 had seen them all together, that they are both overt acts, und evidence of overt acts of high treason, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 67 Now, before I state to you the particulars of the evidence, Iam afraid I must, however pulnfal it i8 to me to ask so great a portion of your attention. trouble you with some gencral observations, that I think will have a tendency to render intelligible to you the cumplicated mass of evidence, which I have to lay before you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 68 Gentlemen, the convention, meant to be called by those who are charged with the conspiracy in this indictment, was, as I collect from the effect of the evidence, a convention of persons, who were to assume the character of a convention of the people, claiming, as such, all civil and political authority, proPosing to exercise it by altering the government, otherwise than by acts of the present constituted legislature, otherwise than by those statutes, according to which the king has sworn at the hazard of his life to govern. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 69 Gentlemen, if this is made out, it appears to me to follow necessarily on the part of all who took a step to assemble it, that they are gucity of a conspiracy to depose the king, to depose him trom the character which he holds in the constitution of the sovereign power of this kingdom, as by law established, that law by which I again repeat to you, he is sworn yo govern. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 70 Gentlemen, if they conspired to assemble ina convention, which was of its own authority, and against the will of the legislature, and in defiance of it, to act as an assembly to constitute a government, and to assume so far sovereign power, it is, I conceive, according to the law of England, a conspiracy to depose from the sovereignty him, who under the restraints of the constitution and the law, now holds that sovereignty. There cannot be two sovercign powers in a state; there may be a complication of authorities vested in a great variety of persons, making up one sovereizn power, but there cannot be two sovereign powers ina state: itisimpoussible. Ifa mecting assembled as a convention of the people, arrogating to themselves all civil and political authority us such, and meaning to exercise it, one or other of these consequences must follow: the king and the parliament must be obedient to the meeting, or the meeting, asscinbled as a convention, must be obedient to flic king and parliament : if the mecting isto be obedient to the king and parliament, it cannot eticct its purposes; it is impossible : if its purpose be to depose the king, I say, a conspiracy to call such a meeting is an overt act of high treason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 71 Gentlemen, I beg your attention to my expressions : if the meeting means to oblige the king and parliament to be obedient to them by the exertion of open force, though it may not effect its purpose, that makes no difference, the law must be the same—I may be wrong Perhaps in stating the law, but it appears to me that the law must be the same if the meeting projects the purpose, whether the force of the meeting is suflicient to effect the Purpose or not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 72 This, I say, is a conspiracy to assume the sovereign power: it is a conspiracy therefore of necessity meant to depose the existing power, and of necessity to depose the king. I say meant to depose; for I repeat it, that whether the conspiracy is successful or not, is immaterial. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 73 Gentlemen, though the particular fact of calling such a convention, now alleged as an overt act of treason, may be represented to be new in the history of this country, it is not therefore, and because it is new only inasmuch as it is more than ordinarily audacious, less an overt act of compassing the death or deposition of the king, if the intent of it was to sub. vert the sovercign ruling power. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 74 Gentlemen, there is another distinction, ta which I would beg your attention. It is of no consequence whether the first meeting, proposed to be assembled, was designed to be a convention, thal should assume all civil and political authority, or was only to detise the means of forming a constituent assembly, u body which should assume it; for any act taken towards assuming it against the will, in defiance of, and against the authority of the king and parliament, and removing him from that situa tion in the character of sovereign, which he has in this country; any act taken towards the formation of a body, which was to assume such authority, is an act of conspiring the deposition of the king: any act towards convening a national assembly, to act with sovereign power, not formed by the legislature, is an act done towards deposing the king, who now has, under the restraints of the constitution, and the provisions and limitations of the law, the sovercign power vestedin him. You cannot set about organizing a body, which is thus to act, without meaning to depose the king, without meaning to form a body that is to usurp the powers of government. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 75 Genticmen, I think the evidence, that I shall lay before you, will most abundantly satisfy you that the convention, which the persous charged conspired to form, was a convention to alter the whole form of the sovereign power of this country, that it was to form, or to devise the means of forming, a representalive government—to vest in a body, founded upon universal suffrage, and ‘the al leged unalienable, and, as they are called, imprescriptible rights of man, al the legislative and executive government of the country ; that aconspiracy to this end would be an overt act of high treason, I presume cannot be disputed; it deposes the king in the destruction of the regal office in the constitution of the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 76 state. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 77 Gentlemen, I go farther: if it had been intended to have retamed the name and office of the king in the country, and to have retained it in the person of the present king, creating, however, by the authority of the intended convention, a new legislature, to act with him, provided they would allow him to act with such new legislature, and thus calling upon him to act against the express obligations of his cororation oath, if he could forget it, it still would have been a conspiracy to depose him from his royal authority, as now established: if he refused to act, he must necessarily be deposed from that authority ; if he did accept, he was not the king of England, as he is established by law the king of England. But he could not accept; he could not so govern; he is sworn not so to govern; he must refuse, must resist, and, in consequence of resisting, his life must be in danger. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 78 Take it either way, that persons conspired to form a convention to assume all civil and political authority, as pretending to be a convention of the people (I care not with how much audacity they pretend to be a convention of the people), or to devise the means of constituting such a convention, in order, and with the intent, and against the authority of parliament, that there should be no king, or in order to the erecting, by their own authority, a new legislature to act together with a king, and together with the king, if they permitted the present to be the king, I submit that such a conspiracy is an overt act in the true construction of law, and high treason in dompassing the king’s death. The king must be deposed while such a new constitution was framing ; he could not treat with such a convention till he had been deposed ; it could be those only, that had sovereign authority, that could frame a constitution: then he is surely, by this, despoiled of his kingly government, even as in a case, of temporary imprisonment. I repeat again, that he could not, consistently with his coronation oath, do otherwise than reject it when framed: it must be taken for granted he would reject it; his life, therefore, could not but be in danger. To suppose that such a meeting, which proposed a new consutution, would depart quietly home, and not act, if it was not accepted, is out of the reach of all human credulity ; itis not according to the ordinary course and experience of mankind, to suppose that they should meet in numbers, and make no use of their numbers, if the show of them did not produce the effect intended : this is not according to the ordinary course and experience of mankind. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 79 Gentlemen, the king in his parliament could not be the sovercign powcr the moment the meeting could act as a national constituting assembly, or could direct, with effect, such an assembly to meet. The power sv to act, or to organize with effect such a meeting that should so act, must pro tempore depose every other power. This 1s the character of a convention of the people, I think, as given in the evidence I have to lay before you. With respect to the detendant, I think I shall satisly you he conspired to call such a convention; and that he said that the convention, which I am to call, is irresistible, it is unlimited, it is uncontrollable, and that by such a convention, my full and fair representalion of the people, or a full and fair representation in parliament (if you choose to take that expression, for it is not mere expression that determines what men mean), is to be accomplished. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 80 Gentlemen, in the country in which I am speaking, when a vacant throne was given (1 am now alluding to the time of king Willian) by those, who, as they are stated in the Bi of Rights, represented all the estates of the people of this realm, to king William and queen Mary, they, who gave it, ceased to have or to exercise the power of sovereignty : in that instant, as every lawyer must speak of it, in that instant the sovereign power of this coon became vested in the king and queen upon the throne, to be exercised in legislation, undoubtedly, with the advice and consent ov parliament, formed according to the Inw and custom of the country—incapable of being exercised otherwise, and, as to the executive authority, exercised under the control of provisions and limitations of the law and constitution, and with the advice which, in every act which the king does, makes somebody responsible. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 81 I insist that the design of conspiring to assemble the people, who were to act as a convention of the people, claiming all civil and political authority, or claiming power to alter, against its will, the constituted legisiature, or a mecting to form the means of bringing together such a convention so to act, Is an attempt to create a power subversive of the authority of the king and parliament, a power, which he is bound by oath to resist at all hazards. But it will not rest here: this will be sufficiently proved; but evidence will likewise be offered to you as satisfactory to prove that the express object of calling this convention, the express object of appointing a committe of conference and co-vperation, which was to devise the means of constituting sich a convention, was ultimately, and finally, and in their prospect, the deposition of the king. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 82 Convene, beyond this, and supposing it not to be proved, the indictment has charged as overt acts, a conspiracy, without the mean of a convention, and not through that enedium, to depose the king; if that consp acy is made out by otheracts, though neither a convention, assuming all political authority, nor a meeting to devise the means of calling a convention, which should assume all political authority, was intended, yet the indictment is made good. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 83 Gentlemen, the indictment farther charges as an overt act of compassing the king’s death, which without question it is, the conspiracy to levy war; I do not mean constructive war. This I state, without question, to be an overt act of compassing the king’s death. A rising to oblige the king toalter his measures of government amounts to levying war within the statute. - A conspiracy to levy war for this purpose is an overt act of compassing the king’s death. If they conspired to form a representative government, excluding the king entirely, which I say is the fact, or, if they conspired not to form a representative government, excluding the king entirely, but yet tocompel him, by their own strength and force, to govern with others, and without those, which he chose to remain with him, by whose advice and consent alone he is sworn and bound to govern, I mean the great council of the nation, the Lords in Parliament assembled, the Commons in Parliament assembled, according to the constitution of the country, and to substitute against his will, and against the will of the present constituted authority of the country another authority, formed on the principles of universal suffrage and annual representation, and so formed without the authority of parliament, I must submit to the court, and to you, that conspiring to do this would be an overt act of treason of deposing the king, and therefore of compassing his death. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 84 Gentlemen, you will also observe the indictment has charged, and proof will be offered to you to make it out, that these objects were meant to be carried by force, by actual force. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 85 Gentlemen, the case, as I have hitherto represented it, is not a case aiming merely at intimidating the legislature, and inducing it by an act done, which was, according to the forms of the constitution, to bury the constitution in its grave, to new-mould the sovereign power; the case goes far beyond this; application in any shape to parliament was not only disavowed, but the very competency of parliament, if applied to, to make a law to new-model the government, was disputed, and denied; the idea of that competency was held to be irreconcilable to the very principle upon which these persons assembled. I must however insist, and I mean to doit, with the full concurrence of my bumble opinion, that a conspiracy to compel the king, by force, inst his will, to give his assent to an act obtained from the Houses of Parliament in order to alter the government and frame of the constitution of the country, whether it was obtained from the two Houses of Parliament, or either of them, by overawing them, or not overawing them,—that a conspiracy, by force, to compel the king, in the exercise of the highest and most essential act of the sovereignty of this country, in the act of giving his consent to such an act,—to compel him, by force, to do that, is unquestionably an overt act of treason in deposing him, and in compassing his death. Itis neither more nor less, to explain it in a word, than to substitute the will of those, who conspired to force him, in the room of that royal will, in which, and by which alone, the laws of this country, and the constitution of this country, have said that a bill (however obtained betore it comes to him) shall receive the authority of a statute. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 86 Gentlemen, I have thought it necessary to state thus much before I come to state the circumstances of the case, and I will state to ae in a word why. It is not to be expected yy persons, who execute the great and important duty in the great and important station, the functions of which you are now called upon to execute, that council at the bar shall be able to state to you law, that no man can question the soundness of: nay, gentlemen, it is not to be expected by you that counsel at the bar should be able to state to you in all cases law, which men of grave character, and excellent understandings, of great reason, and reat experience in their profession, may not ispute the soundness of. It is the duty of counsel, more particularly it is the duty of that counsel, who ought to remember that, if, in Pree the subject, he presses him unfairly, he Betrays in the most essential point the duty which he owes to the soveTeign: it is his duty to endeavour faithfully and honestly to explain and expound the law, that is, to apply to the facts of the particular case, reasoning upon the law, according as he is able to do it, in the exercise of painful industry, exerted under the reflection that be is under much obligation at least to endeavour to represent the law truly. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 87 Gentlemen, I have thought it my duty, in a prosccution, the principles of which interest the civil happiness of all mankind, to mention distinctly and fairly what are the principles upon which I proceed; I have no doubt in my own mind, but that I have stated these doctrines as the law of England would state them, and}I claim from you and from the public that, in the fair exercise of my duty, conducted under such a sense and understanding of that duty, as I have now explained to jou, you and they will do me the credit at leat to think, that the principles whichIhave stated are such as I believe to be sancs tioned by the law of England. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 88 Gentlemen, I shall presume for a moment, after having read to you the indictment, and given you that exposition of it, which I humbly offer to your attention, that the law has (at least, according to my judgment, it certainly has) been complied with in this respect; namely, the indictment has told you with sufficient certainty what it is, that is meant to be imputed as an overt act of com. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 89 passing the king’s death. It is not necessary to be disputing that now, because, if I have failed in the due execution of my duty in that respect, the prisoner cannot be injured by it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 90 Gentlemen, I have before said to you, that, in a case of high treason, the evidence must not only be convincing, but it must be formal ; and, though the object of the security of the person and government of the king is the highest object that the law has looked to, yet I must, at the same time, inform you, that the law for the security of the public which is in truth part of the object involved in the object of the security of the person and government of the king—is essentially united with it—and inseparable from it: the law has required not only that you shall have one witness, if he were the most credible man in the world, to give convincing evidence of the fact, but that that convincing evidence must be rendered yet more conclusive by the testimony of two witnesses; that you should at least have one witness to one overt act, and another to another overt act of the same species of treason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 91 Gentlemen, having stated to you the project, in a general way, to which I apprehend this indictment applies, I presume that you may possibly reason thus: When this indictment charges, that these persons compassed the death of the king, and to depose him,— that they conspired to assemble a convention in defiance of the authority of parliament,— to subvert the rule and government of the kingdom, against the will and in defiance of the legislature,—to dethrone the monarch, reigning in the ‘hearts of a great majority of his people, you will naturally ask,—by what Process was it, that such persons as these could effectuate such a purpose? When the indictment charges, that they composed a great variety of books, containing incitements to choose persons, as delegates, to compose a convention for such traitorous purposes,—in what language, you will naturally ask, could such incitements to such a momentous project, have been conveyed, and to whom could that language have been addressed? When it charges, that they met, and deliberated among themselves, together with divers other false traitors,—at what time, in what manner, and in what place, it may be asked, have these people met to deliberate upon that project, for the accomplishment of which somany persons must be engaged
ATTORNEYGENERAL 93 Now, gentlemen, my answer to this isa short one. I think it will be proved to your Satisfaction, that, as they meant, in the words of the act of parliament, to introduce that system of misery and anarchy, which Prevailed in France, they meant to introduce it by the same means,—to proceed upon the same principles to the same end,—and by the same acts to execute the same purposes. Gentleinen, if the experience of Europe had not manifested what has passed in France (and this project might perhaps be brought from France into Great Britain by but an individual or two), if that experience had not shown us what has passed in France, to the destruction of its old government—to the destruction alike of that government which they substituted in the room of its old government—and which, in the last act of its Power, protested against the existence of clubs, as incompatible with the security of any country, I say, till the subversion of government in France took place, and upon principles, to a blind admiration of which in this country,—a country which, under the pee culiar favour of Providence, is alike in its blessings, as it is inits situation, ‘ toto divisos orbe Britunnos, we have found a disposition to sacrifice all those blessings—it could not perhaps have entered into the heart of man to conceive, that a project so extensive should have been set on fick by persons in number so few; that a project, existing almost every where, should yet be visible no where; that a project should be so deeply combined, and complicated,—should exist to such an almost inconceivable extent,—should be formed with so much political craft—it could not enter into the heart of man to conceive, that it should have existed in any country, much less, that it was possible that it should exist in this country of Great Britain to the extent in which I am sure, whatever your verdict may say upon the guilt of the prisoner, you will be satisfied it has existed in this country. But the law of England does not require that any such case as this should be proved before you. If you are satisfied that what the indictment charges was imagined, and that a step was taken to effectuate that intent, it is enough—it is not the extent, in which the project was proceeded upon—it is not the extent to which the project was Tuinous —it is not necessary to prove, that the Means were as competent to the end proposed, as they were thought to be, by those who used them. No, gentlemen, the providence of the law steps in upon their first motion, whether they furnish themselves with means adequate or inadequate to their purposes—the law steps in then, conceiving its rovidence at that moment to be necessary be the safety of the king and the security of the subject. The project, the general character of which I shall give you, proving it by the particular facts, and applying the particular facts (for I have no right to give you the general project, unless I can so apply the particular facts) to the person now accused, seems to me to have been this.. Imported from France in the latter end of the year 1791 or 1792, by whom brought hither : does not much matter, the intent was to constitute in London, with alliliated societies in the country, clubs which were to govern this country upon the principles of the French government, the alleged unalienable, imprescriptible rights of man, such, as they are stated to be, inconsistent in the very nature of them with the being of a king or of lords in a government—deposing, therefore, the moment they come into execution, in the act of creating a sovereign power, either mediatcly or immediately, the king, and introducing a republican government with a right of eternal reform, and thercfore with a prospect of eternat revolution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 94 Gentlemen, we have all heard of a club called the Jacobin Club at Paris. This, with its affiliated societies,—however impossible it was thought that it should effect such things, —however wild the man would have been thought, into whose head such an imagination could have entered as that it could effect them, first overset the old constitution, then introduced another, which could not exist upon the principles which gave it birth, and has finally introduced government after governmeat, till it has at last Ieft the country in that undescribable state of things in which we now see it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 95 Gentlemen, the great end of the persons concerned in this project, though not altogether visible, or not much disclosed upon its first formation, was, when they had sufliciently diffused their principles through this country, by artifice,—by union,—by combination, — by affiliation, —by fraternization (those who formed the project, whuever they were, endeavouring tu force it into execution by means which perhaps would shock the minds of men that are not always dwelling upon political subjects), to assemble a convention of delegutes from clubs, to assume the power of the people, supported in the assumption and exercise of that power by the individual members of the afhliated socicties, and by their combined strength. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 96 Gentlemen, we have no occasion in this cause to-be disputing upon abstract questions, as to the power of the people to change their government. I state to you, that the intention was, to asscmble a convention of delegates from those clubs, to assume the powers of government. The people, the infinite majority of the people adverse to any change, distinguishing between abuses in the administration of the government, and vices in the form of the government administered, nay, ardently attached to the old government, must have been averse to have been subdued by a convention of the delegates from these societies, who meant to have assumed the representation of the people, and to have exercised the powers which they stated to be inherent in those whom they professed to represent. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 97 Gentlemen, it is not difficult to conceive, after what has happened in fact in France, how it should happen that the opinion of these fraternizing societies should have the force of the will of a majority of the nation, though they constitulcd a vast and infinite minority indeed. You will tind, in the evidence to be laid before you, that it was perfectly understood how this might be by those who are named in this indictment. The great bulk of the community, engaged in different pursuits, are therefore incapable of being combined in opposition to the execution of a purpose, which is to be brought about by great bodies of men, that are combined. I need not give you a stronger instance of it than this : It is within the memory of most of us living, that a few thousand men in St. George’s-fields, combined in one purpose, reduced this metropolis to an absolute state of anarchy, a state in which no government existed. If any man had been asked, a fortnight before the event to which I am now alluding, Is it possible for four or five thousand men to assemble in St. George’s-fields, and to rob and plunder every body they choose in London and ten miles round it? That would have been thought utterly impossible—but yet it happened—why? because a combination of the few will subdue the many, who are not combined, and with great facility; and combined bodies of men have had, as you will find, an existence in this country, to an extent which few men had any idea of. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 98 You will find them organized,—prepared for emergencies and exigencies,—relying upon their own strength,—determined to act upon their combined strength, in a system of acting together,—in some instances acting with a secrecy calculated to elude observation—in other instances, procceding, by directly contrary meaus, to the same end,—representing their numbers as greater than they were, an therefore increasing their number by the very operation of the intluence of the appearance of strength upon the minds of others, without a possibility that that misrepresentation should be set right. You will find them intlaming the ignorant, under pretence of enlightening them; debauching their principles towards their country, under pretence of infusing political knowledge into them; —addressing themselves principally to those whose rights, whose interests are, in the eye uf the law and constitution of England, as valuable as those of any men, but whose education does nut enable them immediately to distinguish between political truth and the misrepresentations held out to them,—working upon the passions of men, whom Providence hath placed in the lower, but useful, and highly respectable situations of life, to irritate them against all whom its bounty hath blessed by assigning to them situations of rank and property,—representing them as their oppressors, as their enemies, as their plunderers, as those whom they should not suffer to exist; and, in order, at the same time, to shut out the possibility of correcting original error, or rectifying the opinions of those whom they had so inflamed, misinformed, debauched, and misled, not admitting them into these affiliated societies till they had subscribed tests— the principles of which they were not to examine after they bad been admitted, but the principles of which they were to carry into execution, when assembled in a convention to carry into execution those principles, as acting for the people, by a great majority of whom they were held in utter detestation. Gentlemen, to say that an act done was meant to be done as a means taken in the execution of such a project as this is, till the person, who takes it, thinks the scheme practicable, I admit is not reasonable, but -undoubtedly he may think it practicable long before it is really so. Now, you will be abundantly satisfied, that these conspirators thought that the time was now come—that the time for a convention, which had been the object of anxious expectation, doubting for a year or two whether it would ever be gratified, that that time was now come, and the measures taken were taken upon that snnposten that the Se ereny had arrived, which, if not laid hold of now, would be lost for ever. Gentlemen, the people of this country have in general a rooted attachment to its government. The public opinion of government is in this country, as well as in every other, its principal support: and therefore it became necessary to infuse, where so much could be safely suggested, where the mind was prepores for it, an opinion, thut the form of the ritish government was radically vicious— that it was-founded on principles of oppression—that it was founded on the destruction of natural, imprescriptible, and unalienable rights. —With others, you will find, they thought it necessary to use a little more cau-. tion— not to alarm them, but to humour their attachment to the form of the constitution, by taking advantage of well-meaning ignorance, under pretence of instructing it, to enlist them also alike in the project of destroying that constitution to which they were attached. To them, therefore, the form of the government was not spoken of in terms which they might understand to be a condemnation of it, though they were really such, but by making use of general expressions, such as obtaining “a full and fair representation of the people in patliament—" a full representation of the people, sometimes without mention of parliament—never with actual mention of the King and Lords, as co-existing together with parliament; by using terms, which certainly may mean what it may be contended in the defence they did mean; but terms the same in their expression, certainly the same in their import, as those which were usedin every act which passed in this country during the time of the Commonwealth, when we neither had King nor Lorde; that may signify a government existing without Lords or King, by declaring the obtaining such a representation of the people as necessary to the natural, unalienable, imprescriptible rights of man, as stated by Mr. Paine: by these means and artifices, they attempted to engage in their service the physical strength of men who might not and did not discover the real nature of the plan, which that strength was to be employed in executing; who fad not information enough to discover what the representation was meant finally todo or to execute. But you will find the persons mem tioned in this indictment had no doubt about it. I mark these circumstances to you, because, in the evidence that is to be laid before you (and I am now stating the general character of the evidence, and not the principles upon which the charge is made), in the evidence to be laid before you of the plan for the execution of these purposes, some very rematkable particulars occur; and when you eome to decide upon this case, I humbly hes your attention to those particulars; some very remarkable particulars will occur. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 99 You will find that the ledding clubs, by which I mean the Constitutional Society, judging of its conduct for the purpose of this cause, though in some other cases we must go farther back, but, for the purpose of this cause, judging of its conduct from about the beginning of the year 1792, and the London Corresponding Society, which was formed, whether created, I will not say, but which was modelled by some leading members of the Constitutional Society, and received its corporate existence, if I may use the term, as it will be proved, under their own handwriting; most distinctly from the handwriting of some, who yet belong, and some, who have ceased to belong to the Constitutional Society; these leading societies, you will find, enlisting into their affiliation many societies in the country, composed of men who expressed their doubts as to the views of these societies in London; who expressed their fears as well as their doubts about those views; who required information as to the purposes of those societies in London; some of these societies in the country professing one set of principles, some another; but al assistance is taken that is offered: accordingly you will see, that the London societies enlist persons who profess, “ that they ought to submit to no power but what they have themselves immediately constituted: to these they give answers, couched in dark, cautious, prudent, but satisfactory and intelligible terms: those who profess still to have attachments to the monarchy of the country, and who express apprehensions about its safety from the principles of the London societies, and the conflicting principles of various country societies, they sooth into fraternization, by telling them that all would be set right “ by a full and fair representation of the people in parliament ;—a name which was given to the uy 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 100 Commons under Cromwell, as well as to the legitimate parliaments of this country at different periods,—without telling them either what these words meant, or how that parliament was to operate to reconcile these differences, which you will find amounted only to the differences between an attachment to an absolute republic, and an attachment to a limited monarchy. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 101 They enlist alike those, who expressed a wish to know whether they proposed to reform the House of Commons, and those who wished to know whether they intend to rip up monarchy by the roots ; their answers were calculated to satisfy each of them, to satisfy whatever might be the disposition of those, who address the questions to them, eee information upon subjects so totally different. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 102 Gentlemen, this is not all: you will find again, that for these purposes, publicationsupon the government of the country, which are alluded to in this indictment, and which will he given to youin evidence, that publications upon the government of the country were adopted by those societies as their own, and circulated, if I may so express myself, ina mass round the country, circulated in a manner, that totally destroys the liberty of the press in this country
ATTORNEYGENERAL 104 Gentlemen, with respect to many of these pobliations 1 may take notice of what has happened in the history of this country, and though no man wishes less to talk of himself than I do, yet I am speaking in the presence of many, who have heard me both in court and in parliament respecting those publications to which I allude (aiid which will be offered to you in evidence), express the difficulty that my mind laboured under to concede that such a publication as the Address to the Addressers, was not, according to law, an overt act of high treason
ATTORNEYGENERAL 106 Gentlemen, you will also not fail to observe (and I state it as a general feature and charaeter of the evidence that I have to lay before you)—the malignant art, and if I may so express myself, the industrious malignity, with which discontent has been spread by these two societies in London, and the means of spreading it have been studiously and anxiously taught from society to society: the means of spreading sedition, fresh as from London, in every town, all with reference (for they are not material, if you do not find they had such a reference) to the final accomplishment of the same purpose: you will not fail to observe how the passions and interests of individuals have becn assailed, and the method of assailing them taught, according to their stations in life—not merely upon government, —but, for the purpose of subverting government, upon tithes—corn-bills—taxes—gamelaws—impress service—any thing that could be represented as a grievance, as well as the government itself, and to this intent—that, in aid and assistance of each other, societies, as they expressed it, ‘might overspread the whole face of the island, and “ that the island might become free —you will mark their expressions—“ by the same means by which France became so. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 107 Gentlemen, in stating to you the character of the evidence, it is necessary for me to make one observation, and it is the last I shall trou ble you with: it is with respect to the principles upon which construction is to be given to the written evidence that will be adduced in this cause. Now I desire to state this to your minds as a principle perfectly reasonable in the administration of justice towards men, who are called upon to answer for offences that the language which they use, ought to be considered according to its obvious sense. If the language admits, and naturally admits, of a double interpretation, it must then be considered according to the nature of the principle which that language is calculated to carry into execution; each paper must be considered with reference to the context of the same paper, and with reference to the contents of all other papers that form the evidence of the same system, which the paper produced is meant to prove. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 108 Now, if you shoyld find that, in detailing the objects of this society, in detailing when my mind, to state satisfactory reasons why itthey meant to do, and in detailing how they meant to execute what they purposed, they should in fact have stated that they meant neither that which was legal,—nor that which was constitutional,—nor that which was other than treason, it will be in vain that they have thought fit (for the greater prudence, the greater care, and the greater caution which you will have most abundant evidence to prove wey exercised occasionally, but add to the guilt by increasing the danger) to assert at other times, when they have used general language, that what they meant to effect was legal and that they meant to effect it ina legal and constitutional manner. It will become them who have the defence upon their hands, to state to you how, ina legal and constitutional manner those things could be done, which were intended to be done, and which this indictment states were intended to be done, if I prove to your satisfaction that they were intended to be done by the means and instruments, which the indictment refers ado. Gentlemen of the jury, their principle, as you will find, was, that equal active citizenship is the right of all men, and that upon this principle their representation of the people wasto be asked for. Now, it requires no reasoning to state, that a representation of the people founded upon the principle of equal active citizenship of all men, must form a parliament into which no King, nor Lords, could enter. There is an end of equal active citizenship the moment that either of them exists, according to my construction of equal active citizenship, and according to their construction of it; for they state that the effect of itis a representative government. But it is not enough for me to tell you, that, in reasoning, this is the consequence; it is a circumstance to be taken into your consideration ; but I say I shall satisfy you, if 1am bound to go farther, that the application of the principle of equal active citizenship, according to them, was to be the foundation of a representative government, rejecting the King and Lords out of the system. The principles were the principles upon which the constitution of France, in the year 1791, was formed: the principles of that constitution were the principles of equal active citizenship: they attempted indeed to provers a king in the constitution, and to form what I may call a royal democracy: but I shall prove to demonstration, that the leaders of these clubs in London knew that that constitution could not exist, that their principles led them to a distinct knowledge that that constitution could not exist: it was in the month of August 1792 entirely overturned; and you will find from the transactions of this society in the months of October and November 1792, unless I mistake the effect of the evidence, the clearest demonstration that these societies meant in applying those principles, which they themselves state had destroyed the existence of a king in France, because they must destroy the existence of a king in any country,—you will find that, from October 1792 at least, these societies meant to destroy the king in this country, and that this was the natural effect of their own principles, as they understood them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 109 Gentlemen, you will now give me leave to state to you, as wellas I can, and as intelligibly as I can, the mass of evidence, and the case which I have to lay before vou. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 110 The particular act, the nature of which will be to be explained by all the rest of the evidence, which has led to the including these particular persons in one indictment, arose out of a letter, dated the 27th of March 1794, which was written by the prisoner, then the secretary of the London Corresponding Society, to the society for Constitutional Information. The words of it are these : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 111 “ I am directed by the London Corresponding Society to transmit the following resolutions to the Society for Constitutional Information, and to request the sentiments of that society respecting the important measures which the present juncture of affairs seems to require. The London Corresponding Society conceives that the moment is arrived — mark the words; for, in the rest of what I have to state, you will frequently hear of the time to which that allen when a full and explicit declaration is necessary from all the friends of freedom, whether the late illegal and unheard of prosecutions and sentences shall determine us to abandon our cause, or shall excite us to pursue a radical reform with an ardour proportionale to the magnitude of the object, and with a zeal as distinguished on our part as the treachery of others in the same glorious cause is notorious. The Society for Constitutional Information is therefore ree quired to determine whether or no they will be ready, when called upon, to act in conjunction with this and other societies, to obtain a fair representation of the people. Gentlemen, give me your attention presently to what they conceive to be a fair representation of the people, when I come to state the resolutions which they transmit! “ Whether they concur with us in seeing the necessity of a speedy Convention for the purpose of obtaining, (then they use the words), “ in a constitutional and legal method—of the effect of which you will judge presently, for the method will not be the more constitutional and legal for their calling it so, if the method is in fact unconstitutional and illegal—“ a redress of those grievances under which we at present labour, and which can only be effectually removed by a full and fair representation of the people of Great Britain. ‘fhe London Corresponding Soeiety cannot but remind their friends that the present crisis demands all the prudence, .unanimity, and vigour, that ever may or can be exerted by men or Britons; nor do they doubt but that manly firmness and consistency will finally, and they believe shortly, terminate in the full accomplishment of all their wishes, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 112 They then resolve, and these resolutions are enclosed: “ 1st, That dear as justice and liberty are to Britons, yet the value of them is comparatively small without a dependance on their permanency, and there can be no security for the continuance of any rights but in equal laws. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 113 “ 9d, That equal laws can never be expected but by a full and fair representation of the people ; to obtain which, in the way pointed out by the constitution,—you will see what that is in the third resolution—“ has been and is the sole object of this society ; for this we are ready to hazard every thing, and never but with our lives will we relinquish an object which involves the happiness, or even the political existence of oursclves and posterity. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 114 “ rd, That it is the decided opinion of this society, that, to secure ourselves from the future illegal and scandalous prosecutions, to prevent a repetition of wicked and unjust sentences, and to recall those wise and wholesome laws which have been wrested from us, and of which scarcely a vestige remains.— Gentlemen. you will permit me to call your attention to what the cuiects were which were to be accomplished—“ there ought to be immediately,—what
ATTORNEYGENERAL 116 ? And what are the purposes which this convention, which they themselves represent as a convention of the people, are to execute? Why they, the delegates, forming a convention of the people, are to recall those wise, wholesome laws, which they say have been wrested from them. Before I have done, I shall prove distinctly that this iy the meaning of the passage, and the meaning of the passage will be to be collected from the whole of the evidence undoubtedly, not from this particular part of it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 117 The Constitutional Society, there being present at that time six of the persons mentioned in this indictment, without any deliberation whatever upon a proposition so material as this is—and therefore it must be left to you, upon the whole of the evidence, whether it is fairly to be inferred or not, that this, like a-great many other papers of the London Corresponding Society, really came from the Constitutional Society—they immediately ordered that their secretary shall acquaint the London Corresponding Society, that they had teceived their communication, that they heartily concur with them in the objects they have in view, and that for that view, and for the purpose of a more speedy and effectual co-operation, they invite them to send to this society, next Friday evening, a delegation of some of their members. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 118 Without now going into the particulars of what followed upon this, give me leave to state, that some members of the society, included in this indictment, were named to compose that delegation; that there was named at the same time a Committee of Correspondenee of six members of this society; that afterwards the London Sareronding Society formed another cemmittee ; t two committees met; that the two committees meeting, came to a determination that this project of calling a convention of the people should be carried into effect; and then, that a joint committee of co-operation of both societies was formed by resolutions of both. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 119 Having stated what happened upon the 27th of March 1794, and connecting it, as I shall do presently, with the very singular facts, which you will find also happened in that year, you will give me leave, in order to show what the true construction of this act is, as well as to state the nds upon which the indictment, even without this act, charges a conspiracy to depose the king—you will give me leave to state the transactions of these societies from the month of Mareh 1792. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 120 Gentlemen, in or about the month of March 1792,—whether before that time the Londoa Corresponding Society had existed oF not, seems to me to be dubious, and therefore I will make no assertion of that one way or other; but supposing it to have existed, it will be made extremely clear that this suciety existed at that time without a constitution, as they call it, and was indebted te a gentleman of the name of Tooke for the constitution under which the society was modified, and was indebted, I think, to a gentleman of the name of Vaughan, for his assistance in the composition of the code of its laws. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 121 The first correspondence that I find between the Constitutional Society, and the London Corresponding Society, which I have to state to you, is in the communication of the principles of the Corresponding Society, sent with a letter signed by the prisoner at the bar, which letter is in the following words: “I am ordered by the committee to send to the Society for Constitutional Information in London a copy of our motives for associating, and the eeohutions we have come to: we mean to persevere in the cause we have embarked in, that is, to have (if possible) an equal representation of the people of this nation in pare liament. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 122 I observe here for a moment that you will not be surprised, when I get to the conclusion of this business, that this cautious language was used in the outset: it will be for you to judge whether a studied caution is fairly imputable to the language. It proceeds thus: ‘We should be exceedingly happy to enter into a correspondence with that sdciety, if it is not too much presumption in us to expect such an honour; but, as our cause is one, we hope that they will deign to take some notice of us, who are now entering upon a matter of such vast importance. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 123 This is extremely condescending language on the part of Mr. Hardy te the Constitutional Society ;‘it accompanies the resolutions of that society, which resolutions purported to be signed “ Thomas Hardy, secretary. It happened, by an accident not very easy to be accounted for at present, and, notwithstanding which, I shall prove distinctly to you that the resolutions are the act of Mr. Hardy: thet this signature—“ Thomas Hardy, secretary — ie a signature, as I am instructed, in the hand-writing of Mr. Horne Tooke; that is, Mr. Hardy in the London Corresponding Society, sends the resolutions of the London Corresponding Society (apologizing extremely for the liberty he takes in presuming to send them) to the Constitutional Society, the sigNature to those resolutions bearing the name of Thomas Hardy in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke: whether those resolutions were finally settled by that gentleman or not, I do not knew ; but you will find that there exists a paper which contains, I think, distinct evidence upon the face of it, that those resolutions have been settled, with a deal of deliberation, by the same gentleman whose hand-writing occurs in the signature which I have been stating. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 124 Gentlemen, before these resolutions were sent, and before I state the matter of them to you, you will allow me to mention that there ad been a correspondence between other svcieties, and the Society for Constitutional Information, of such a nature, as, in order to make this case intelligible, will require some observations from me, and some attention from you; itis the correspondence of other societies, but which correspondence I shall connect in such a manner with the London Corresponding Society, as in fact to make the acts of the other societies the acts of that society. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 125 Upon the 23rd of March 1792, with a view to show you what were the principles of this Constitutional Society, I must state, that they come to a resolution, hat the thanks of this society be given to Mr. Thomas Paine, for his most masterly book intituled, The Rights of Man, in which not only the malevolent soplistries of hireling scribblers are detected, and exposed to merited ridicule, but many of the most important and beneficial political truths are stated so irresistibly convincing as to promise the acceleration of that not very distant period, when usurping borough-sellers and protligate borough-buyers shall be deprived of what they impudently dare to call their Propertyethe choice of the representatives of the people. The Constitutional Socicty cannot help expressing their satisfaction that so valuable a publication has Proceeded trom a member of that society, and they sincerely hope, that the people of England val give that attention to the subjects. discussed in Mr. Paine’s treatise, which their manitest importance so justly deserves. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 126 Then they resolved, for what purpose you will judge of, when I come to state to you the subsequent evidence in this business—“ That the foregoing resolutions, and all future proceedings of this society, be regularly transmitted by the secretary to all our corresponding constitutional societies in England, Seotland, and France. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 127 Now, gentlemen, as I shall prove what the book was to which this resohition alluded, I shall take the liberty at present to state in a few words to you, as far as they affect the existenee of a king in this country, those subjects, which, according to the language of this resolution, the Constitutional Society sincerely hope that the people of land would give attention to, as discussed in Mr. Paine’s first book. In that book these doctrines, with respect to Great Britain, are laid down: “a constitution is not a thing in name only, but in fact; it has not an ideal, but a real existence ; and you will find this extremely imt, because in the result of the whole evidence that I have to lay before you, it will appear that they did not only distinctly disavow making any application to parliament, but the competence of parliament to de any thing by way of reform, because the country had as yet no constitution formed by the people. Mr. Paine proceeds: “Can Mr. Burke produce the English constitution? If he cannot, we may fairly conclude that no such thing as a constitution exists. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 128 After stating that the septennial bill showed that there was no such thing as a constitution in England, the book states a farther fact, not immaterial, that the bill which Mr. Pitt brought into parliament some years ago to reform parliament, was upon the same erToneous principle, that is, upon the principle that patliataene was able to reform itself. With respect to other subjects, to which the attention of the people of England wascalled, you will find that this book, speaking of modes of government (and this is also extremely material with reference to the construction of what is afterwards to be stated to you), represents that “the two modes of government which prevail in the world are, frst, governments by election and representation ; secondly, governments by hereditary succession: the former is generally known by the name of republican, the latter by that of monarchy and aristocracy. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 129 He divides government into government by election and representation; a representation founded upon election, and election founded upon universal suffrage; and government by hereditary succession. He then states that, from the revolutions of America and France, and the symptoms that have appeared in other countries, it is evident the opinion of the world is changing with respect to government, and that revolutions are not within the progress of political calculation; and that the British government, not existing upon the principles he recommends, is not a government existing upon such principles that a nation ought to submit to-it; and that the liament of the country is not able to form a government, that will exist upon those pripciples. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 130 Gentlemen, it is a very remarkable circumstance, as it strikes me, that, though various societies had existed in other parts of Great Britain, till about the time of the formation of the London Corresponding Society, none of these societies had asked or invited affiliation with the London Constitutional Society, which you will find they all ask and all invite about March 1792, whether by management or not, I do not pretend to determine, it will be for you to judge; but they all ask and all invite affiliation with the Constitutional and Corresponding Societies, as soon as the latter is formed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 131 Upon the 16th of March 1792, you will find a resolution of the society for Constitutional Information, which states and returns thanks fora communication from Manchester, signed “ Thomas Walker, president, and “Samuel Jackson, secretary ; in which they return the thanks of the society to Mr. Thomas Paine, who appears to have been aa member, a visitor of this Constitutional Society, “ for the publication of his Second Part of the Rights of Man, combining Principle and Practice. I shall endeavour to state to you in a few words what is the combination of the practice stated in the Second Part of the Rights of Man, with the Lib in the First Part, “a work, they say, “ of the highest importance to every nation under heaven, but particularly this, as containing excellent and practicable plans for an immediate and considerable reduction of the public expendigure for the prevention of wars, for the extension of our manufactures and commerce, for the education of the young, for the comfortable support of the aged, for the better maintenance of the poor of every description, and, finally, for lessening, greatly, and without delay, the enormous load of taxes, under which this country at present labours. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 132 “ That this society congratulate their country at large on the influence which Mr. Paine's publications appear to have had in procuring the repeal of some oppressive taxes in the present session of parliament ; and they hope that this adoption of a small part of Mr. Paine’s ideas will be followed by the most strenuous exertions to accomplish a complete reform in the present inadequate state of the representation of the people, and that the other pest plans of public benefit, which Mr. Paine has so powerfully recommended, will be speedily carried into effect. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 133 ow, gentlemen, as Mr. Paine’s plan for the remedy of the present inadequate state of the representation of the people was alluded to, and this book was alloted to, which combined “ principle and “ practice, and as it is stated that the other great plans of public benefit, which he had so powerfully recommended, would be speedily carried into effect, it will be necessary to show you, from this letter, what were those plans for the remedy of the inadequate state of the representation of the people, and other plans of public benefit, which this society, recciving the thanks of the Constitutional Society, hoped would be carried into effect. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 134 Gentlemen, I do not take up your time in stating the passages to you, but represent to you the substance of that book; that itis a k distinctly and means recommending the deposition of the king : if the passages in that book do not prove that assertion, there is no evidence that can prove any assertion : it is a book, moreover, which not only puts the king out of the system of the government of the country, but, according to which, if'a perfect representation of the people is to be formed, it 1s to be formed not by a parliament existing in a country—in which that gentleman states that no constitution exists—not by that parliament, which he states to be totally aud a solutely inadequate to the great work of forming the constitution upon the nights of man and equal active citizenship, which he recommends: it is a work, which calls upon the people of England to do themselves justice in another way of proceeding, and to form a constitution for themselves before they can have any government, which is to exist upon true principles. There is then, I say, in the beginning of this thing, a developement of these purposes; and I say, beyond that, that if I understand the effect of evidence at all, I shall satisfy you that those, who voted this resolution of thanks, knew that the principles there referred to, were principles that would have this operation, and meant that they should have this effect. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 135 The next thing I have to state, which I shall not go through very particularly, is contained in a resolution of the Constitutional Society (some of the members of which, I shall prove to you, began to leave the society about this time, stating distinctly that they understood its principles to be now different from the principles it had formerly acted upon, and to be such principles as I have stated) entered into upon the 23rd of March 1792. They resolved that another communication, which is from Sheffield, should be published in the Morning Chronicle, and in several other newspapers, which they, mention. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 136 With respect to the communication from Sheffield (and it is a remarkable thing that, from Shefteld, and from Norwich, they should be writing, on the same day, for the same urpose—that the societies of Sheffield and Nomick might be affiliated with the London Constitutional Society, and the Sheffield peo ple were so anxious about it, if it were their own act and deed, that they wrote more than ope letter in order to ask it), it is to this ef ect: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 137 “ Itis now about four months since this society first formed itself into a regular body 5 they were then but very few in number; the encleeed will inform you of their increase, and, which is most probable, will soon become very numerous ; and not only this large and populous tewn, but the whole neighbourfor many miles round about, have an attentive eve upon us: most of the towns and villages indeed are forming themselves into similar associations, and strictly adhere to the mode of copying after us: you will easily conceive the necessity for the leading members of this body to pay strict attention to good order and regularity, and the need we have of consulting and communicating with those who are sincere friends and able advocates for the same cause ; for these reasons we took the liberty to write to Mr. Horne Tooke, that worthy friend and patriot for the rights of the people, informing him of our earnest desire of entering into connexion with the society of the same denomination of ours in London; his very obliging and affectionate answer favours us with your address; in consequence, we have taken the liberty herewith to transmit to yu some resolves, which were passed at our last meetings by the whole body, and the committee was charged with the dispatch of panne and forwarding them to you accordingly, for the purpose of submitting them to the consideration of your society, and to make use of them as they think most prudent. You will also notice the Belpar address: they applied to us about two months ago for instructions as to our mode of conducting, &c. had not then formed themselves into any regular association. Belpar is nearly thirty miles from this place, in Derbyshire, and eight or ten miles from Derby. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 138 “ If the society for Constitutional Information in London should vouchsafe so far to notice us, as to enter into a connexion and correspondence with us, it cannot fail of proMoting honour, and adding strength to our feeble endeavours, and to the common cause, which is the entire motive we have in view. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 139 They then, upon the 14th of March, 1792, knowing that there was a connexion between the London Constitutional and London Corresponding Society (and that they should know that fact on the 14th of March, which is sixteen days before the Soth, when Mr. Hardy sent to Mr. Tooke the resolutions which were signed in the name of Mr. Hardy by Mr. Tooke, as a communication to him that there was such a body as the London Corresponding Society, is a circumstance that affords observation); they then add, “ We have taken the liberty of enclosing a parcel for Mr. Hardy, in answer to a letter from him to this society, requesting some information concerning our method of conducting the business we had embarked in, &c. also informing us there are in London a number of mechanics, shopkeepers, &c. forming themselves into a society on the broad basis of the rights of man. You will be so obliging as to let the packet remain with you until he call for it, as by this post I have wrote him thereof. We have given him our manner of proceeding from our setting out to this time, and hope it may be of some use. The improvement we are about to adopt is certainly. the best for managing large bodies, as in great and populous towns, viz. dividing them Into small bodies or meetings of ten persons each, and these ten to appoint a delegate; ten of these delegates form another meeting and so on, delegating from one to another, till at last they are reduced to a proper number for constituting the committee or grand council. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 140 There is another letter of the same date, which has a remarkable circumstance about it. It is addressed to the Constitutional Society. gentlemen, it states that “ this soe ciety, that is, the same Sheffield Society, “ feeling, as they do, the grievous effects of the present state defects and abuse of our country, —(the word originally in this letter was cone stitution, but the word constitution, not bein, that which was liked, by some very odd accident in the letter from Sheffield, the word country, in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke, is substituted for constitution )—“ the great and heavy oppressions, which the common people labour under, as the natural consequence of that corruption, and at the time being sensible to a degree of certainty, that the public minds and the general sentiments of the ple are determined to obtain a radical reform of the country, you will mark these roe “ as soon ag prudence and discretion wil. permit, believes it their duty to make use of every prudent means, as far as their abilities can be extended, to obtain so salutary and desirable an object, as a thorough reformation of our country, the word country being again in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke, “ estas blished upon that system, which is consistent with the rights of man,’—for these reasons they state their forming into clubs, as the former letter did, and they conclude thus— “ that being thus strengthened, this rromck 4 may be better enabled to govern itself wit! more propriety, and to render assistance to their fellow-citizens in this neighbourhood, and in parts more remote, that they in their turn may extend useful knowledge still farther from town to village, and from village to town, until the whole nation be sufficiently enlightened and united in the same cause, which cannot fail of being the case, wherever the most excellent works of Mr. Thomas Paine find residence. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 141 Those works are the works which hava held an hereditary monarchy, however limited, to be inconsistent with the rights of man; which have held the constitution of parliament in this country to be inconsistent with the rights of man; and those works, upon the principles of that inconsistency, have held even the parliament itself incompetent to reform any abuses in government. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 142 The paper they transmit states as a fact, that the number of members at Shefficld were, in March 1792, two thousand. -That the Constitutional Society in London and the Constitutional Society at Sheffield, thus numerous, should have had no connexion by affiliation till the 14th of March, 1792, though, on that 14th of March, 1792, it appears that the Sheffield Society had had correspondence, and had become connected with the London Corresponding Society, prior to the London Corresponding Sucicty sendin the paper I before stated to the Constitutional Society, is somewhat remarkable. The paper proceeds thus: “ This society, om are chiefly of the manufacturers of s 1d, began about four months ago, and is already increased to nearly two thousand members. In this letter, dated March 14, 1792, they state it to have amounted to two thousand, exclusive of neighhouring towns and villages, who were forming themselves into similar societies. They then state the principles upon which the societies are formed, and that “ they have derived more true knowledge from the two works of Mr. Themas Paine, intituled Rights of Man, Part the First and Second, than from any other author on the subject. The tice as well as the principle of government is laid down in those works, in a mannet so clear and irresistibly convincing, that this society do hereby resolve to give their thanks to Mr. Paine for his two said publications intituled Rights of Man. Gentlemen, I beg your pardon for addressing you so much at length on this case, but I feel it my bounden duty to the public, to you, and to the prisoner at the bar, to warn you fully of the whole of it. There is nothing which, I am sure, would more certainly happen, than that I should go, not only out of this court, but to my grave, with pain, if I should have stated to you in a proceeding of this nature the doctrines of Mr. Paine, otherwise than as I think of them. If that is meant to be intimated, that we may have no dispute about them, and that we may not misunderstand what is that principle, and that practice, to which the passage I have now read alludes, you will allow me to read a few passages out of this second part of the Rights of Man, said to contain both the principleiand practice of government, and then I ask you what those must have intended, with respect to the government of this country, who meant to take any step in order to make a change in it, in such a way as the principle and practice laid down in that book would require them to make it, recollecting that the government of this country is a government consisting in a king, having an hereditary crown, together with Lords and Commons, forming a parliament according to the laws and constitution of England. Now, that author, in the first place, expresses a great deal of what possibly may be differently thought of by other persons, but what I cannot call good-will to the people of England—for he says, “ that during the time of the American war, he was strongly impressed with the idea, that if he could cet over to England without being known, and only remain in safety till he could out 8 publication, that he could open the eyes of the country with respect to the madness and stupidity of its government. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 143 Let us see in what that madness consisted according to him: having stated in his former book that a government ought to exist in no country, but according to the principles of the rights of man—he re again the distinction he had stated in his former book, between what he calls the two systems: he says, ‘“ that the one now called the okd is hereditary, either in whole or in part, which is that of England; and the new is entirely repregentative,—that is,.a government consisting of a Commons House, if you choose so to call it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 145 “ Hereditary successionis a burlesque upon monarchy. It puts it in the most ndiculous light by presenting it as an office, which any child or idiot may fill. It requires some talents to be a olan Lise i to be a king requires only the animal figure of man, i ant of ireatlinns autumaton. This sort of superstition may last a few years more, but it cannot long resist the awakened reason and interest of man ; then, “ in whatever manner the separate parts of a constitution may be arranged, there is one general principle, that distinguishes freedom from slavery, which is, that all hereditary government over a people is to them a species of slavery, and representative government is freedom ; then, speaking of the crown of England, that crown, in which, according to the law and constitution of this country, aecording to its principle and practice, is vested the sovereignty in the manner in which I have stated it, he says, “ having thus glanced at some of the defects of the two Houses of Parliament, I procced to what is called the crown, upon which I shall be very concise. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 146 “It signifies a nominal office of a million sterling a year
ATTORNEYGENERAL 148 Gentlemen, in another part of this work, you will find that Mr. Paine was very well aware of what these Sheftield correspondents were aware of, if they were the composers of the letter to which I have alluded; that the rinciples, laid down in the constitution ofrance, which these two books were to re-commend, and the principles, stated in: Paioe’s first book, were absolutely inconsistent with the constitution itself of France, as it existed at that moment; and Paine propheti-cally (he would not have had common sense if he had stated it otherwise), even in thebeginning of 1792, when he publishes this ; book, foretells that the government of France, with a king a part of it, upon his principles, ; and the ‘principles professed by the constitution of France, could not exist: he foresawshat in August 1792; and I will prove, that persons, who were thus approving the rinciples and practice of Paine, new that a ing could not exist consistently with those ; principles ; and they adopted them therefore, ; as we insist, in order that a king should not -exist in this country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 149 Gentlemen, these resolutions being received perhaps from Sheffield, a step is taken upon them in the Constitutional Society, and & step, which gives an authenticity to the. book I have in my hand, namely, the book of ; their proceedings, whichis remarkable enough; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 150 for in this society’s book there are these resofutions, which are supposed to be received from Sheffield, watered to the book ; and then with a view of 2 publication of them, in the ong Chronicle, World, Post, Times, Argus, English Chronicle, and General Evening Post, for the purpose of cireulating the principles of Mr. Thomas Paine, and for the purpose of circulating the representation, which is made in these resolutions, there is first of all, in Mr. Tooke’s hand-writing,— “ Society for Constitutional Information, London, March 23rd, 1792. This Society having weceived the following and other communications from Sheffield, vi2
ATTORNEYGENERAL 152 “ Resolved, that this society will on Friday next, March 31st, ballot for the twelve associated members recommended by the Sheffield committee, and approved at this meeting
ATTORNEYGENERAL 154 Gentlemen, this society, having in this letter expressed an inclination that they should have some associated members in the Constitutional Society, that affiliation begins in the Constitutional Socicty in London, which I have alluded to; and accordingly you will find, that upon the 31st of March, twelve persons were ballotted for as from the Sheffield Society, and became associated members of this society; you observe, that this letter had stated from Sheffield that they had received before a communication from Mr. Tooke, and Mr. Tooke afterwards writes a draught of a letter which is sent to them, in which he states, “I am directed by the Society for Constitutional Information to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, and to express to you that very great pleasure and satistaction which they received from your communication; the society have unanimously elected twelve (here follow the names of the persons), “ as associated msmbers of this society.’—These persons being certainly, gentlemen, extremely respectable men as subjects of Great Britain, but at the Same time men, that one wonders a little should, upon such a purpose as this, without a little more instruction being infused into their minds, have been associated as members into this society—“ and we flatter ourselves, that when any business or other occasion shall lead any of those gentlemen to London, they will be kind enough to honour the society by their presence, and give us an opportunity of cementing that friendship between us, which all the zealous friends of public freedom and the happiness of mankind ought to feel and exercise towards each other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 155 “P.S. I am desired, by Mr. Horne Tooke, to request each of the associated members to honour him by the acceptance of the books which accompany this letter ;—which were, I apprehend it appears, so many parts of the Rights of Man. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 156 Gentlemen, upon the 24th of March 1792, a paper apeears to have been sent to the Constitutional Society from a nest of societies, the United Constitutional Societies at Norwich: this was the 24th of March 1792, and it appears, as I am instructed, that the words “24th March 1792, are also in the handwriting of Mr. Tooke. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 157 “At a meeting of the delegates of the United Constitutional Societies, held the 24th March 1799, at the Wheel-of Fortune, St. Edmund's in the city of Norwich, it was unanimously agreed to communicate to the gentlemen of the London Society for ConstiPa Information, the following Resoluions: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 158 “ 1st. We are happy to see the success of the Sheffield Society for Constitutional Reform, and approve of the delegations, which you and they have made in order to form a plan of general information. We humbly eg that you would grant to us the same favour ; and it is our wish, that all the Societies of a similar kind in England were only as so many members strongly and indissolubly united in one political body. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 159 “Secondly. We believe that instructing the people in political knowledge, and in their only effectual way to oblain the grand object of reform, for men need only be made acquainted with the abuses of government, and natural and inherent rights as men, is the they will readily jom in every lawfat means to obtain redress; we havethe pleasure to inform you that our societies consist of some hun dreds, and new societies are frequently forming, which, by delegates, preserve a mutual intercourse with each other, for mutual instruction and information; and the greatest care has been taken to preserve order and regularity at our meetings, to convince the world that riot and disorder are no parts of our political creed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 160 “ 8dly. We believe, and are firmly oe suaded (and if any man thought so, he had a right to say so if he pleased), “that Mr. Burke, the once friend of liberty, has traduced the greatest and most glorious revolution ever recorded in the annals of history; we thank Mr. Burke for the political discussion provoked and by which he has opened unto us the dawn of a glorious day. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 161 “ 4thly. To Mr. Thomas Paine our thanks are especially due for the First and Second parts of the Rights of Man, and we sincerely wish that he may live to see his labours— that is, the destruction of hereditary government and limited monarchy, and consequeath the government of England—“ crowned wi success in the general diffusion of liberty and happiness among mankind. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 162 Gentlemen this letter does not appear (though the words, the 24th of Mareh, are in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke) to have been read in the Constitutional Society till the 14th of May 1792, when they read this letter, and also another, which I will now state to you, from the society called the Norwich Revolution Seciety. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 163 “ The Norwich Revolution Society wishes to opena communication with you atthis time, when corruption has acquired a publicity in the senate, which exacts from the honour the British nation renewed exertions for parliament reform—without prejudging the probable event—(this is a material passage. when you connect it with what is found in other subsequent papers) —“ even of such an application to the legislature, the soeicly is willing to circulate the information, and to co-operate in the measures, that may seem best adapted to further so desirable and so important an end; it is willing to hope the redress of every existing grievance at the hands of a government resulting from an extraordinary convocation in 1688—an extraordinary convention of all, who had at any preceding time been elected representatives of the people, assisted by the hereditary counsellors of the nation, and a peculiar deputation from the metropolis; which - national constituting assembly cashiered for miisconduct a king of the house vf Stuart. — 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 164 The opinions und principles of this society are best explained by an appeal to their literary representative— o James Mackintosh, author of the Vindiclz Gallice, the society affers the tribute of its approbation-and gratitude for the knowledge, the eloquence, and the philosophical spirit, with which he has explained, defended, and commented on the revolution of France; it hesitates to assent to this only of his opinions—that there are but two interests in society, those of the rich and those of the poor—if so, what chance have the latter? Surely the interests of all the industrious, from the richest merchant to the poorest mechanic, are, in every community the same, to lessen the numbers of the unproductive, to whose maintenance they contribute, and to do away such institutions and imas abridge the means of maintenance, y resisting the demand for labour, or by sharing in reward : as the means most conducive to this comprehensive end, the Norwich Revolution Society desires an equitable representation of the people. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 165 “ The Rights of Man by Thomas Paine, and the advice to the privileged orders by Joel Barlow, a book which I shall give in evidence, and therefore shall state some passages from presently, “have also been read with attention and circulated with avidity
ATTORNEYGENERAL 167 Barlow’s book you will find is, in the plainest and most unequivocal language, as I understand it, an exhortation to all people to get rid of kingly government, and addressed more Particularly to the two societies I have mentioned, as containing the substance of the buSiness, in which they are interested, as you will see when I come to state the transactions of October 1792. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 168 he Rights of Man by Thomas Paine, and the advice to the privileged orders by Joel Barlow, have also been read with attention and circulated with avidity; they point out with clearness most of the abuses which have accumulated under the British government ; they attack with energy most of the prejudices which have tended to perpetuate them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 169 Now, how any man living could thank these People without informing them that, if they really meant well to their country, they must be ignorant in the extreme, or something worse, if they could reconcile cither the Rights of Man or Joel Barlow’s book on the Privileged Orders with the principles of that convention in 1688, which is the foundation of the liberties of this country, is to me quite inexplicable. But, after stating the constitution of this country, in a letter fabricated with great art, there follow the twelve names of the intended associated members from Norwich; and the description of some of these twelve happens also, from a singular circumstance, to be in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke. Then this society returns thanks to the societies at Sheffield and Norwich for these communications. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 170 The resolutions of the London Corresponding Society, which I told you were sent on the 30th of March, are to this effect : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 171 “ Resolved, That every individual has aright to share in the government of that society of which he is a member, unless incapacitated. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 172 “ Resolved, That nothing but non-age, or privation of reason, or an offence against the general rules of society, can incapacitate him. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 173 “ Resolved, That it is not less the right, than the duty of every citizen, to keep a watchful eye on the government of this country, that the laws, by being multiplied, do not degenerate into oppression, and that those who are intrusted with the government do not substitute private interest for public advantuge. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 174 “ Resolved, That the people of Great Lritain are not properly represented in pariiament, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 175 “ Resolved, That in consequence of a partial, unequal, and inadequate representation, together with the corrupt method in which representatives are elected, oppressive taxes, unjust laws, restrictions of liberty, and wasting of the public money, have ensued. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 176 “ Resolved, That the only remedy to those evils is, a fair and impartial representation of the people in parliament. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 177 “ Resolved, That a fair and impartial representation can never take place until partial privileges are abolished, and the strong temptations held out to electors afford a presumptive proof, that the representatives of this country seldom procure a seat in parliament from the unbought suffrages ofa free people. Resolved, That this society do express their abhorrence of tumult and violence : and that, as they aim at reform not anarchy, reason, firmness, and unanimity be the only arms they employ, or persuade their fellowcitizens to exert against abuse of power. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 178 Gentlemen, in this, which I have now read to you, I am willing, if you please, that you should construe every word of it, though certainly it is pot consistent with the principles of British government, upon this principle, that those, who sent that paper to the Constitutional Society, if it even was sent there at all, really understood it to be consistent with the principles of the British government; and I claim no credit for the veracity with which Lassert, that this conspiracy has existed, unless I show you by subsequent acts of this society, that at this moment they meant what Mr. Paine says, in principle and practice, is the only rational thing—a representative government ; the direct contrary of the government which is established here. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 179 You will find, by what I shall lay before you, that there was a society in Southwark. —To this society the London Corresponding Society, in a letter which I have to read to you presently, stated their adoption of all Mr. Paine’s principles, with a view, as I think, to the practice recommended in his works: this society also received the thanks of the Constitutional Society fora communication which I am about to state to you; and the London Corresponding Society afterwards entered, as it seems to me, into-a combination with them, upon the principles stated in that communication: I say it is impossible, attending toConstitutional Society—“ and with the Socithese facts, for any man who reasons fairly, ety for Constitutional Information in London, to doubt that the principle of the London ! as the best means of cementing the common 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 180 Corresponding Suciety and of the Constitutio-nal Society was, to furm a representatice go- ; vernment, in this country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 181 A declaration from a society in Southwarkwas read: Resolved, that the thanks ofthis society be given to the Southwark societyfor the following communication, and that it be published in the newspapers : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 182 “ April 19, 1792, at the Three Tuns tavern,Southwark — Resolved, That we do now form ourselves into a society for the diffusion ofpolitical knowledge. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 183 “ Resulved, That the society be denomi- nated the Friends of the People. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 184 “ Resolved, That the following be the declaration of this suciety,"—which is the preamble to the constitution in France, in the year 171 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 185 “ Considering that ignorance, forgetfulness, or conten:pt of the rights of men, are the sole causes of public grievances, and the corruption of government, this society, formed for the purpose of investigating and asserting thoserights, and of uniting our efforts with others : of our fellow-citizens for correcting national abuses, and restraining unnecessary and exorbitant taxation, do hereby declare— 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 186 “First, That the great end of civil society is general happiness. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 187 Secondly, fhat no form of government is good, any farther than it secures that object. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 188 “ Thirdly, That all civiland political autho-rity is derived from the pecple—that people, of whom they were afterwards to form a convention. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 189 “ Fourthly, That equal active citizenship is the unalienable right of all men; minors, criminals, and insane persons excepted. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 190 Now will my friend dispute with me what these principles, according to the ideas of those who state them, lead to? “ Fifthly, That the exercise of that right, in appointing an adequate representative government,—that is, the government, which Mr. Paine tells you, rejects every thing that is hereditary—is what; “ the wisest device of human policy—not only that, but it is— “ the only security of national freedom
ATTORNEYGENERAL 192 The Sone for Constitutional Information return their thanks upon that also, and then those persons who write this letter say farther in the same paper— 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 193 “We call upon our fellow-citizens, of all descriptions, to institute societies for the same great purpose—that is the purpose of introducing representative government— and we recommend a general correspondence with each other—but attached and rivetted to the union, and of directing with greater ener, our united efforts to the same common ol jects. ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 194 What were the objects of this society ? You will find that the objects of this society were the objects of the Constitutional Society ; and you will find presently that they were the objects of the Corresponding Society : The Constitutional Society resolved, that every society, desiring an union, or correspondence with this, and which doth not profess any principles destructive to truth or justice —how this gives occasion for the first remark T have to make upon language—“ or subversive to the liberties of our country: but which, on the contrary, secks, as we do, the removal of corruption from the legislature and abuses from the government, ought to be, and we hope will be embraced with the most brotherly affection and patriotic friendship by this society. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 195 1 observe upon this, that all this handsome language is perfectly consistent with this principle, in the minds of those who write it, and they do not venture to explain it, because I think they durst not explain it,—with this idea in their minds, that those principles were destructive of truth aud justice were subversive to the liberties of the country, which were principles in opposition to those of Mr. Paine; and that all practice, that was in opposition to the practice he recommends, was subversive to the liberties of the country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 196 I come now to a circumstance or two, which lead me to state shortly what will be proved to be the original constitution of the London Corresponding Seciety—the plan (the efficacy of which had been tried in France, and which men, who came from that country, were probably well acquainted with)—was, to unite, first small bodies of men—as svon as they came to a greater number, to divide them into smaller parties, and so to spread themselves by degrees (as you will find in the letters, was the purpose of these societies), from town to town, from village to village, from hamlet to hamlet, till, as they explain it, there should not be an unenlightened man in the country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 197 The constitution of the London Corresponding Society was formed upon this principle ; it will appear from the written evidence which will be produced to you, that a gentle. man of the name, I think of Felix Vaughan, was appointed a delegate upon the 30th of April, for No. 63; that Mr. Hardy cousulted him; and, being also appointed to form a constitutional code of Jaws for the Londom Corresponding Society, Mr. Hardy consulted him upon that subject. The preamble te the resolutions which formed their constitution was this: “ Whereas it is notorious that very numerous butthensomeand unnecessary taxes are laid on the persons and families of us and others the industrious inhabitants of Greatfor No. 68; Mr. Richter, a pai 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 198 Britain, an exeeedingly great majority of whom are, notwithstanding, excluded from all representation in parliament; and as apon inquiry into the cause of this grievance, which 13 at once an obstruction to our industry, and a diminution of our property, we find that the constitution of our country, which was purchased for us at the expense of the lives of our ancestors, has by the violence and intrigue of criminal and designing men, been injured aad undermined in its most essential and impettant parts, but particularly in the House of Commons, where the whole of the supposed representation of the people is neither more nor less than an usurped power—I hope, gentlemen, it cannot be required that I should contend against such an assertion in this lace, if a court of law in this country has not ost all the character that belongs to law ; how that usurped power was ever to be employed as an organ in the constitution of that new representative body that this society atmed at, consistent with their own principles, remains to this moment unintelligible to me— ‘arising either from abuses in the mede of election and duration of parliaments, or from a corrupt property in certain decayed corporations, by means of which the liberties of this nation are basely bartered away from the bribed profit of the members of parliament: and as it farther appears to ws, that until this source of corruption shall he cleansed by the determination, perseverance, firmness, and union of the people at large, we are robbed of the inheritance so acquired for us by our forefathers, and that our taxes, instead of being lessened, will go on increasing, as they will furnish more bribes, places, and pensions, to ministers and members of parliament: we therefore, having resolved to unite ourselves into one firm and permanent body, for the purpose of informing ourselves and others of the exact state of the present parliamentary Tepresentation, for obtaining a peaceful but adequate remedy to this intolerable grievance, and for corresponding and co-operating with other societies, united for the same objects, have unanimously adopted the following regulations for the internal order and government of our society. They then state their regulations ; and their constitution having been thus formed, they publish it afterwards in the month of May. What observations they state to the public upon it in the month of May I shall have occasion to represent presently ; you will see the manner of proceeding with respect to the election of their delegates, by the production of a particular paper. On the 13th of April, a person, whom you have heard much of Mr. Margarot, is appointed a delegate; upon the 30th of April, Mr. Vaughan was, as tar as the paPer is evidence of the fact, appointed delegate for Number 65; Mr. Richter, a party named in this indictment, and Mr, a another party, inst whom the grand jury have found abil, but who is not caandiea this indictment, are also appointed delegates. Mr. Hardy is not only secretary, but he is appointed, upon the 13th of April a delegate ; and there is a choice of delegates for the whole of these bodies. You will find they afterwards met from time to time, to pursue the great purposes of their incor, tion, at an alehouse, I think, the Bell in Exeter street, in the Strand, from which place some of the correspondence I am abontto state to you comes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 199 Gentlemen, the Society for Constitutional Information, having afhliated several societies very suddenly with themselves—whether Mr. Paine remained in this country or not I cannot tell—they felt an inclination to affiliate with another society, which is to be, as it appears to me, in justice to them, very strongly distinguished indeed with respect to the principles upon which they acted, I mean the socicty calling itself the Friends of the People, meeting at Free Masons’ Tavern: with what prudence or discretion that society formed itself is a subject which I shall not discuss, but it is a most important fact, that in the first attempt, which the Society for Constitutional Information made (and it ought to be known in justice to the Friends of the People), the first attempt they made to affiliate themselves with the Society of tha Friends of. the People, that society, in correspondence that will be read to you, acts as some individual members of tlie Constitutional Society had done ; they say —“ No, we discover your design from what you are doing; you tell us, from your approbation of resolutions entered into at Manchester, signed by Mr. Walker and Mr. Jackson, that you approve the sort of schemes Mr. Paine has set forth; that you approve projects of giving, im loose and indefinite terms, the full extent a what you a the rights of the ple, to the people: that is Ai see intent ae think,—and, gentiemen, many a man may very honestly thinic it, but he must go about the execution of his thoughts in a leyal way, if he does so think, if he means to reduce his thoughts into praetice—“ we think that parliament is not adequate to all the ends for which it is instituted as a body, through which is to be spoken, as far as the constitution requires, the will of the people; but we do not mean what you mean; we mean to preserve the forms of the constitution, which itis clear you do not; we mean, says lord John Russell, in a letter, which will be read, “ to preserve the forms of the constitution, and therefore must decline all correspondence with you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 200 Gentlemen, it happens—it belongs to secieties of this nature, and I desire to he understood, therefore, in stating it, only es stating a circumstance, which in its nature does belong to those societies, and which will happen—that it was thought necessary, forthe great purpose of doing that which was eventually to be done, that a society, which had rejected co-operation with the Society for Constitutional Information, should still be kept, for the purposes of the Society for Constitutional Information, in fact and effect corresponding and connected with it. Accordingly Pi will find that this Suciety of the Friends of the People, rejecting upon principle the plan which they thought abandoned the forms of the constitution, that this society retained, in its own bosom, according to the account J have of it, many members, who happened to belong to the other society, and the work of both societies went on by the same instruments: they were thus therefore connected in fact, though they did not choose as a body to have one society in connexion with the other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 201 Gentlemen, having stated that, you will allow me now to mention, though it is a little out of date, but it also connects itself with and illustrates the last observations I made, that the society at Sheffield, which had connected itself by affiliation with the Society for Constitutional Information, and you will also find with the London Corresponding Society, had received, about the 24th of May, intelli-ae from the Society of the Friends of the eople, which stated to them very correctly what their objects were, the means by which they meant to accomplish them, and the attention which they meant to pay to the forms of the constitution. Youwill now see what the Society for Constitutional Information understood to be the objects of the Sheffield Society, and what the Sheffield Society understood to be the objects of the Society for Constitutional Information. The Sheffield Society (though I do not know that they kept their word) distinctly disavowed, in a letter of the 26th May, to the ConstitutionalSociety, having any thing more to do with that socleyy called: the Friends of the People —which meant to preserve the forms of the constitution ; represented that they had totally misunderstood them, and would have nothing more to do with them, but to the extent, to which the Society for Constitutional Information permitted. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 202 You will find in a letter from Sheffield, of the 26th of May, and this corrected by Mr. Tooke, that they thank the Constitutional Society for accepting their members. They then state that they had increased to two thousand four hundred
ATTORNEYGENERAL 204 “ Previous to the reception of this packet, we did communicate to them by letter the pleasing hopes it reflected on us on looking forward, viewing such respectable characters signalizing themselves in support of the people’s rights, agreeable to the above principe and the denomination by which they ave entitled themselves, &c. In due course they would receive our letter last Thursday seven-night; and in consequence, we apprehend the packet was forwarded to us on the same day, but without any written communication. We shall not attempt any further communication with them, until we are favoured with your sentiments upon the subject, or until matters of doubt which are at present entertained be removed. Then there 1s a note, which shows the necessity of this fostering care of the Constitutional Society: they say— Birmingham in particular claims all the assistance from established societies, which possibly can be administered. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 205 Having written to the Constitutional Society upon the 26th of May, they find it expedient, for the same purpose, to trouble their correspondents of the London Corresponding Society ; “We were favoured with your very affectionate letter of the 7th ultimo, and communication, in due course; and I am directed by this society to inform you, that it is with infinite satisfaction they receive the information, that your firm and laudable endeavours are directed to that effectual and necessary purpose, of opening and enlightening the ublic mind, and disseminating useful knowedge amongst the general mass of the people : by an orderly proceeding in a firm pursuit of truth and equity, there cannot be a doubt but that our joint endeavours will in due time be crowned with success. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 206 “ As brothers and fellow-labourers we congratulate you on the rapid progrees of useful and real knowledge in the various parts of this nation, which sufficiently indicates that the time cannot be far distant when truth will be more predominant, equity more gererally administered, and sound wisdom more universally sought after. When pride, ambition, and ignorance give place to these virtues, when oppression ceases and charity abounds, when men in principle and practice verify the necessity and advantage of doing to others as they wish to be done by; then, and not till Noe can any people or nation be said to be 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 207 We have herewith enclosed our rules, &c. Should have written you much sooner, but on account of a diappointment in the printing of our articles, &c. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 208 “Our numbers continue to increase, both here, and in the adjacent towns and villages ; a general coucurrence prevails, as to the necessity of the business, and the measures adopted by this society for obtaining our object. It will be of great importance to the cause we are engaged in, that a more frequent communication be maintained amongst: all the similar institutions; for which reason we beg the favour of your correspondence at every convenient specrtaplyy which will be highly obliging to this society, who in return pledge themselves to observe the same rule. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 209 Gentlemen, having stated to you now what it was that the Society of the Friends of the People discovered to be the object of the Constitutional Society, and I agreeing with them in thinking their discovery upon that subject was accurate and right, you will find it necessary to go back, and to proceed in the order of time to the 7th of April. Mr. Hardy sent from the London Corresponding Society a copy of their resolutions to the Society for Constitutional Information, which was established at Manchester, and desired also to have correspondence with them, as they were engaged in one common cause; that Manchester Society, you will recollect, which hoped that the other great benefits which Mr. Paine had stated, would be carried into effect. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 210 He says, “ We began this society about ten weeks ago; it is composed chiefly of tradesmen and shopkeepers. The enclosed will inform you of the principles we set out upon. —When we first associated, we flattered ourselves that no other societies in the nation were formed upon the same principles—butin two or three weeks afterwards we were most agreeably informed of our brethrenat Sheffield having taken the lead in so glorious a cause —we immediately wrote to them, and were answered without delay, expressing a wish to unite with us, for promoting the ends we have in view, and we are assured of success, by persevering prudently, and with unanimity. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 211 Upon the 18th of April 1799, in furtherance of this plan, you will find Mr. Hardy writes a letter to the president of the society in the Borough—Now that is the society, the principles of which I have so distinctly stated before, as leading to representative government, as the only security for liberty in the country. —It appears that their declarations had also been sent to the London Corresponding 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 212 Society; and Mr. Hardy, upon the 18th of April 1792, says “ I am ordered by the London Corresponding Society, to send a copy of their resolutions to the society that meets at the Three Tuns tavern, in the Borough, established on purpose for restoring the rights of election, or in other words, to obtain aug equal representation of the people of this nation in parliament. ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 213 Now they had avowed, and avowed in their declaration, that their object of a representation of the people in parliament was precisely that more extended one in its principle, which obtained at the timeof the Commonwealth in England—namely, a representation of the people in parliament, termed a parliament, but without King oF Lords, a representative government—“ We should: be very happy to enter into a correspondence with your society—as we are all engaged in the same grand and important cause, there is an absolute necessity for us to unite together, and communicate with each other, that our sentiments and determinations may centre in one point, viz. to have the rights of man re-established, especially in this nation; but our views of the rights of man are not confined solely to this small island, but are extended to the whole human race— black or white, high or low, rich or poor. I give you the following as my own opinion— perhaps you may think it a singular sentiment—and then an opinion is given, which it is my duty to state, though I do not understand it—“ that the king and the nobles, as much as the peasant and ignoble, are equally deprived of their rights
ATTORNEYGENERAL 215 Gentlemen, there is an answer to this, from a person of the name, I think, of Favell, who is chairman of the Friends of the People in Southwark: he says—“ I duly received your letter, containing the resolutions of the London Corresponding Society—which I have communicated tu our society in the borough— andI am directed to return them the thanks of that society, and to assure them they shall cordially unite with them, and all similar societies throughout the kingdom, in endeavouring to effect those great objects for which they are associated—namely, to engage the attention of their fellow-citizens to examine the general abuses of government, and to exercise their deliberative wisdom in a calm but intrepid manner in applying those remedies
ATTORNEYGENERAL 217 A letter aud resolutions from the Revolution and Constitutional Societies at Norwich, dated 26th of April 1792, were read at themeeting of the society for Constitutional In- : formation, on the 4th of May following: they distinctly state—that Mr. Paine’s books were to be the medium, through which the preju- ; dices that had grown up under the British ernment were to be get rid of, and the ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 218 Constitutional Society return them theirthanksjn these words—“ This society receives the above communication with the most heartfelt satisfaction, and desires earnestly to concur and co-operate with those societies in their 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 219 Jaudable objects ; that the secretary do inform them of the same, and that this society has unanimously elected the twelve members of “the Norwich societies to be associated memders of this society. ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 220 Upon the 11th of May 1792, the Constitutional Society resolved, that there should be a communication from that society with the society of the Friends of the Constitution at Paris, known by the name of Jacobins: they send an address to them, which is in thesewords—“ Brothers and fellow-citizens of the world— 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 221 he cordial and affectionate reception with which you have honoured our worthy countrymen, Mr. Thomas Cooper, and Mr. James Watt, members of the society of Manchester, and united with our society, has been communicated to us by the correspondence of those gentlemen. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 222 ‘In offering you our congratulations on the glorious revolution which your nation has accomplished, we speak a language which only sincerity can dictate. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 223 “ The formality of courts affords no example tous: to do our thoughts justice, we give to the heart the liberty it delights in, and hail you as brothers. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 224 “It is not among the least of the revolutions which time is unfolding to an astonished world, that two nations, nursed by some wretched craft in reciprocal hatred, should so suddenly break their common odious chain, and rush into amity. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 225 “ The principle that can produce such an effect is the offspring of no earthly court; and whilst it exhibits to us the expensive iniquity of former politics, it enables us with bold feli‘eity to say we have done with them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 226 “ In contemplating the political condition of nations, we cannot conceive a more diabolical system of government than that which has been generally practised over the world, to feed the avarice, and gratify the wickedness of ambition ; the fraternity of the human race has been destroyed, as if the several nations of the earth had been created by rival gods— 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 227 “man has not considered man as the work of one creator. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 228  The political institutions, under which he has lived, have been counter to whatever religion he professed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 229 “Instead of that universal benevolence, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 230 -which the morality of every known religion declares, he bas been politically bred to consider his species as his natural enemy, and to describe virtues and vices by a geugraphical chart. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 231 he principles we now declare are not peculiar to the society that addresses you; they are extending themselves with accumulatin force through every part of our country, an derive strength from an union of causes, which no other principles admit. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 232 he religious friend of man, of every denomination, records them as his own ; they animate the lover of rational liberty, and they cherish the heart of the poor, now bending unae a oppression of taxes, by a prospect of relief, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 233 “We have against us only that same enemy, which is the enemy of justice in all countries, a herd of courtiers fattening on the spoil of the public. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 234 It would have given an additional triumph to our congratulations, if the equal rights of man, which are the foundation of your declaration of rights, had been recognised by the governments around you, and tranquillit established in all; but, if despotisms be still reserved to exhibit, by conspiracy and combination, a further example of infamy to future ages, that power that disposes of events, best knows the means of making that example finally beneficial to his creatures. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 235 “ We have beheld your peaceable principles insulted by despotic ignorance ; we have seen the right hand of fellowship, which you hold out to the world, rejected i those who riot on its plunder; we now behold you a nation provoked into defence, and we can see no mode of defence equal to that of establishing the general freedom of Europe. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 236 “ln this best of causes we wish you success; our hearts go with you; andin saying this we believe we utter the voice of millions. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 237 Gentlemen, this address was signed by the chairman of the Constitutional Society, and transmitted to Mr. Watt, at Paris; and, upon the 28th of May 1792, was ordered to be published. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 238 After this, the principles of Mr. Paine, which, you observe, contain the doctrines that TI have been stating to you, were carried farther in a third book (I’ mean in that book called the Address to the Addressers, which I shail also be able to give in evidence to you) : Mr. Paine having there gone the length of asserting the folly, absurdity, and wickedness of the government, under which we live—not only of asserting the incompeteney of government, as it is constituted, to change itself, but having asserted that a conventionary representation of the people, in that sense in which we speak of it, must do this work, he proceeds to the extent of stating the plan and form of an organization of that sort, upon which the convention was to be framed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 239 Gentlemen, it was impossible not toapply to the justice of the law, against the attack made upon our government by the person who went to the extent I am now stating, with the approbation, published over and over again, of these societies, who, in their corporate character, if I may so speak, could not be prosecuted for doing 1t—it became necessary to ask a juty of this country, whether these doctrines were to be tolerated—what is “the consequence of that? [t is, that these societies immediately enter into subscriptions for the support of Mr. Paine, and they consider themselves as engaged in propagating his works in that way, in which no work ever was propagated —to the intent to produce that convention, without which the nation, in no organization of its government, could be said, according to them, to exist in a state of freedom as a nation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 240 Gentlemen, you will not be surprised, if it also appears that, in going on progressively to the execution of the mischief that was intended, they became more mischievous; and you will find members parting from the seciety, expressly telling them, that they meant to destroy the government of the country ; that they cannot, therefore, stay among them ; and to which members, as far as appears from any information that I have had, they did not condescend to explain themselves—to say, No, you have mistaken our object—this is not what we mean; but they leave them unanswered, and go on to execute the purposes they were about. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 241 Having come to those resolutions in order to support Mr. Paine in these prosecutions, they publish the resolutions, they publish the books of Mr..Paine, they publish these resolutions in the various newspapers (the editors of these newspapers insuring, if I may so say, themselves against the hazards of the law, some tor more, some for less, and theyrisk the hazard of 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 242 Propagating the doctrines, provided the consideration paid is ample enough, as a premium for the risk), and then these publications are sent down to the country to various places, in hundreds, and thousands—I am sorry to say, to persons of all professions, to distribute—I am Sorry to say, to some of the most sacred professions, whose numes will appear to you when they come to be read—and this mode of propaaling these doctrines is adapted to the utter mpossibility of detection, and for the very piece of having that effect—to make the aw of the country unequal to the mischief, which it was to meet. Atthis time a proclamation was issued hy the executive government of the country, in order to restrain these publications; and both the societies, you will find, cloaking theimselves under the words “a full and fair representation of the people, which words they have never condescended to explain, which words never do exist in any text of any writing of theirs, as I can find, with the mention ofa king, or other house of legislature : they should spread the effect of the mischief more widely and diffusely than otherwise they could have done. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 243 Upon the 24th of May 1792, there isa letter sent from Mr. Hardy, I believe not in his own hand-writing, but I believe in the handwriting of Mr. Vaughan, whomIbefore named to you, in which he states, that, by the direction of the London Correspunding Society, he had the honour of enclosing to them a copy of their address and regulations, which he requests they will communicate to: the Constitutional Society. The thanks of the society were given to them for this; and that is a publication more guarded than anothet you will find published upon the 6th of Aus gust 1792, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 244 After stating their constitution, which I bes fore mentioned to you, it says— But, as Pros vidence has furnished men in every statioa with faculties necessary fur judging of what concerns themselves, shall we, the multitude, suffer a few, with no better right than ourselves, to usurp the power of governing us without control? Surely not: let us rathef unite in one common cause to cast away our bondage, being assured, that in so doing we are protected by a jury of our countrymen, while we are discharging a duty to ourselves, to our country, and to mankind. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 245 Gentlemen, you will find from a paper of the 6th of August, that that, which they supposed was to meet with protection from a jury of the country, was a ccmbination to re form the government of the country by means—other than application to parliament —which binds together, with the king, as the great political body of the country, the whole system under which we live. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 246 Gentlemen, the London Corresponding Sos ciety, as to the king’s proclamation, followed the example of the Canatitunonal Society, and, on the 3tst of May, 1792, in a paper that will be read to you, they vilify the proclamation ; and this paper having been communicated by the London Corresponding Society to the Constitutional Society — they, aware of the nature of it, order, that that paper should be published in such newspapers as will receive the advertisements of this socicty
ATTORNEYGENERAL 248 You will find a letter, dated the 14th of June, 1792, trom certain persons styling themselves the Editors of the Patriot (whe they are Iam not able to state to you, but who, for the purposes of these societies, thought it necessary to conceal their names), in which they desire the Corresponding Society to take am opportunity of enlightening the public mind by publications, by advertisements, by circulating those papers in villages to country farmers, desiring, as I 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 249 vilify the proclamation, and they make tiestated, to conceal their name, but requesting very means the executive government took tothat the papers might be sent-to a person, suppress the mischief a mean by which theywhy holds an important situation in a subseent part of this business—a Mr. Gale, a kseller at Sheffield. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 250 Gentlemen, there will be laid before you various parts of the proceedings of the Constitutional Society, which relate to Mr. Paine, which I shall now pass over, except for the purpose of calling your attention to another publication of his upon the sixth of June, 1792, and which was addressed to Mr. Dundas; you will likewise find that that book, which will be given you in evidence, distinctly disavows all hereditary government; all monarchy, under whatever qualifications ; and then, for the purpose of circulating this doctrine, as they had before circulated the doctrines in other works of this gentleman, they order, “ that twelve thousand copies of that letter shall be printed for the society, for the purpose of being transmitted to our correspondents throughout Great Britain, and that a committee be appointed to direct the same. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 251 Gentlemen, I pass on now to the 6th of August, 1792; at which time there appears to me to have been an extremely important transaction in the London Corresponding Society; it is the propagation of an address of that date, which first developes, as it seems to me, though in somewhat of covert language, the determination of these societies to work what they call a reform without any communication whatever with that parliament, which they held to be incompetent to bring about the business. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 252 You will find that, upon the &th of August, Mr. Hardy wrote a letter to Mr. Tooke; that he sent him a proof copy of this address; that he hoped it would merit his attention, and his approbation; that he should be exceedingly happy to be favoured with his opinion of it before it was printed. The address, after stating what they considered as the grievances of the country, states this— Such being the forlorn situation of three fourths of the nation, how are Britons to obtain information and redress? Will the Court, will ministry afford either? Will parliament grant them? Will the nobles or the clergy ease the people’s sufferings? No. Experience tells us, and proclamations confirm it, that the interest and intention of power are combined tu keep the nation in torpid ignorance. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 253 ‘ “It then states the only resource to be in these societies; it then states various detailed reasons, which you will hear, and then proceeds to this effect: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 254 “ Numerous other reforms would undoubtedly take place, even in the first session of parliament so elected, dependant only on their electors the peoples untorn therefore by faction, undivided party, uncorrupted by ministry, and uninfluenced but by the public good. Every transaction would tend to reform, aud a strict economy, its natural consequence, might soon enable us to reduce our taxes ; and by the integrity of parliament, that reduction would light upon such objects as best might relieve the poor; this to the people would prove an advantageous and a novel session, and to an honest parliament not a tiresome one. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 255 “ Therefore, Britons, friends, and fellow. citizens, with hand and heart unite, claim what is your right, persevere and be free, for who shall dare withstand our just demands? Oppression, already trembling at the voice of individuals, will shrink away and di for ever, when the nation united shall assert its privileges and demand their restoration. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 256 Gentlemen, the address you will find was circulated with infinite industry to every correspunding society in the kingdom, conveyed through every possible channel, the doctrine adopted by all the affiliating societies; ard the plan, which they went upon from this 6th of Augus& 1792, appears to have been a plan to redress themselves by their own ower, and by their own strength, and not by application to that parliament, which alone can act in legislation: it seems to me to be impossible that you can mistake what is meant by this paper, if you will give your more particular attention to a paper which was received from a society at Stockport, upon the 27th of November, 1792, and found in the possession of Mr. Hardy: this, aftes adverting to those numerous grievances stated in the address of the 6th of August, 1792, is to this effect: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 257 “ In obedience to the wishes ef the soeiety here, I have the pleasure of acknowledging the honour of your letter, and the packet, which the kindness of our brothers of the London Corresponding Society so opportuncly presented us with. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 258 “It is doubly deserving our thanks, as it shows your kindness, and as it will be useful in the formation of our infant society ; we stand much in need of your experience in thig particular, and we doubt not of your best assistance; we are surrounded by a majority, a formidable one indeed in power, abilities, and numbers, but we are not dismayed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 259 “ We have carefully perused the addresses, and I am to observe upon their contents in general, that the sentiments hardly arise to that height which we expert from men sensible to their full claims to absolute and unconrtrolluble liberty, i. e. unaccountable to any power which they have not immediately constituted and appointed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 260 “ These are our sentiments, whatever may be yours; though, in the present state of political knowledge, it may be prudent not to avow them openly. We desire your sentiments on the means of accomplishing that object, which we presume you have in view in common with us; we think it expedient that we should perfectly understand each other in the beginning, lest the appearance of disunion might furnish matter of triumph to our enemies ; we observe one expression,’—you will take notice that Mr. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 261 Hardy at this time was a member both of the London Corresponding and the Constitutional Societies: —“ we observe one expression, which says, ‘ numerous other reforms would take place,’ &c. &c.; but we ask how is that parliament to be chosen? Can we erfet st from the present order of things? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 262 ould not all the evil be done away at once by the people assembling in convention ? Does it appear probable that the odious laws which we complain of, will be abolished any other way? Can the grievances arising from aristocracy be redressed while the retains its present authority in the legislature ? —whether this blank is to be filled up with crown or the House of Lords is for you to judge—“ retains its present authority in the legislature? Is the universal right of conscience ever to be attained while the maintain their seats onthe “ Your thoughts on these important points -we most earnestly desire may be transmitted to us as soon as possible, not directed as the Jast,—and this you will find often occurs ; letters sent under a feigned direction; “ we fear it will excite suspicion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 263 The Stockport Society say of the address of the 6th of August, 1792, sent tothem, that they think it hardly amounts to sentiments such as theirs, namely, that they must have absolute and uncontrollable liberty, unaccountable to any power which they have not immediately constituted—that could not be the king and parliament of Great Britain— they say, ““ We presume you have the same view in common with us, and we desire to have your sentiments upon the means of accomplishing that object. What object? The object of putting themselves in a situation of being unaccountable to any power, which they themselves had not immediately constituted and appointed—how was that to be done 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 265 “ With infinite satisfaction the London Corresponding Society’s committee perused your letter; they are happy to learn your steady determination, in spite of all obstacles, to pursue that sole means of political felicity, a perfect representation of the people. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 266 “ Now, what was the sole means of this political felicity—a perfect representation of the people
ATTORNEYGENERAL 268 ; and an annual parliament,—a body might exist under the term parliament in a commonwealth, as well as under a king—“ nothing short of such a senate, chosen by the i whole nation, will satisfy us. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 269 “ True generosity, the characteristic of this nation, and of all unperverted men thoughout the globe, calling upon us to countenance at this juncture the arduous struggle of the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 270 French nation against despotism and aristocracy, those foes to the human race, we have 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 271 ‘ resolved upon addressing the French National Convention. You will permit me to observe, this was upon the 11th of October 1792: the king of France was deposed in effect upon the 10th of August 1792. This passage, in the transactions of this society, appears to me te be peculiarly worthy your attention. “ Without entering into the probable effects of such a measure, effects, which your society will notfail to discover, we invite you to join us; and to that end, herewith you have a copy of our intended address; if you approve the idea, and will concur in sending it, be pleased to return us without delay, a copy signed by 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 272 ‘your president: we will then associate yourbody with ours, and with some others, who have already assented to the measure: if, on the contrary, you disapprove that mark of zeal towards the only nation that has hitherto undertaken to restore to mankind its just rights, please to communicate to us your objections. This was upon the 11th of October 1792; upon the 6th of October 1792, Mr. Barlow (whose name occurs before with respect to his publication relative to the privileged orders) writes a letter to the socicty for Constitutional Information, accompanied with a book, called “ Advice to the National Convention of France ; and you will be pleased to observe, that Mr. Barlow, and a Mr. Frost afterwards, in the month of November, were sent with an address from the Constitutional Society to Paris, as their delegates for that purpose, The letter of Mr. Barlow. is in these words: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 273 “ I have lately published a small treatise under the title of ‘A Letter to the Nation “Convention of France, on the Defects of the “Constitution of 1791, and the extent of the “Amendments which ought to be applied :’ although the observations contained in this letter are more particularly applicable to the French nation in the present crisis of its government, yet, as the true principles of society are every where the same, their examination cannot be unseasonable in any nation, or at any time; believing, therefore, that the subject of this treatise will not be thought foreign to the great object of your association, I present a copy of it to you with the same coulidence as I have done to the National Canvention, and to the Constitutional Society at London, a confidence arising trom the full persuasion that the work is founded in truth and reason. I take the liberty at the same time to send you a copy of another publication, intituled ‘ Advice to Privileged Orders.’ The present disposition in Europe towards a geneTal revolution in the principles of government is founded in the current of opinin, too powerful to be resisted, as well as too sacred to be treated. with negicct; and it is the duty of every individual to assist, not only in removing the obstructions that are found in the way of this revolution, but in ascertaining, with as much precisivn as possible, the nature of the object to be aimed at, and the consequence to be expected from the attainment: it is above all things to be desired, that the convictions to be acquired from national discussion should precede and preclude those which must result from physical exertion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 274 Now, you will give me leave to state to you what the doctrine is in this book, for which the Society for Constitutional Information, Mr. Hardy then a member of it, thank Mr. Barlow, make him an honorary member, and afterwards depute him to the National Convention of France1. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 275 Gentlemen, the doctrine, I can explain it to you generally, without troubling you by readAng particular passages, amounts to this: Mr. Barlow, after stating the principles of equal active citizenship, which found their way into the constitution of France in 1791, and which constitution had made the king a part of the system of that government, informs them of the glorious victory of the 10th of August, as the papers, which I have to adduce presently, represent it; that it had accomplished finally the effect of those principles, which he understands to be the principles of those to whom he was writing; that it is impossible they should consist with this sentiment, (hat a king could be retained in a government; that the constitution was at variance with itself; that those who made it had not discovered that, or, having discovered it, they thought the time was not yet come, when they could reduce the constitution to that pure government which was the objectof these societies; hethen tells you, that in government the maxim being that a king can do no wrong, the maxim onght to be, that he can du no good. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 276 This gentleman, so stating his doctrine as an explanation of the principles upon which they are acting, is voted by them an honorary member, and afterwards sent to Paris with the papers, which I am about to read to yon: 4 great deal of evidence will be laid before you, to prove that they had beat up all the country for letters and addresses to express the same principles to France, uot on account of the cause of France, but of the cause of England, and with a view to introduce the same effects into England. I shall state but two of these addresses, because they seem to cuntain the effect of all the rest that were actue ally sent. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 277 The London Corresponding Society first of all communicated to the Constitutional Society, in the month of October 1792, their intention of sending an address to France: the Constitutional Society fully approve the puts pose; they see the end that it aims at, and they determine not to concur in the same address, but to send a separate address; and in their paper you may see the principles of both to be principles, which were expressed for the very purpose of aiding the co-operation of the societies in excluding the king trom the government of the country, and of raising arepublic. This is the letter: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 278 “ Frenchmen, while foreign robbers are ravaging your territories under the specious pretext of justice, cruelty and desolation leadingin their van, perfidy and treachery bringing up the rear, yet mercy and friendship impudently held forth to the world as the sole motives of their incursions; the oppressed part of mankind—that is, Great Lritain—“ forgetting for a while their own sufferings, feel only for yours,’ and with an anaious eye watch the event, fervently supplicating the Almighty Ruler of the universe to be favourable to your cause, so intimately blended with their own, that cause which upon the 10th of August had excluded the king from the government of the country—“ frowned upon by an oppressive system of control, whose gradual but continued encroachments have deprived this nation of nearly all its boasted liberty, and brought us almust to that abject state of slavery, from which you have so emerged ; five thousand British citizens indignant manfully step forth to rescue their country trom the opprobrium brought upon it by the supine conduct of those in power; they conceive it to be the duty of Britons to countenance and assist, to the utmost of their power, the champions of human happiness, and to swear to a nation, proceeding on the plan you have adopted, an inviolable friendship. Sacred from this day be that friendship between us, and may vengeance, to the uttermost, over: take the man who hereafter shall attempt to cause a rupture. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 279 “ Though we appear so few at present, be assured, Frenchmen, that our number increases daily: it is true, that the stern uplifted arm of authority at present keeps back the timid; that busily circulated impostures hourly mislead the credulous ; and that court intimacy with avowed French traitors has sume ellect on the unwary and on the ambitious; but with certainty we can inform you, friends and freemen, that information makes a rapid progress among us; curiosity has taken possession of the public mind; the conjoint reign of ignorance and despotism passes away; men now ask each other, What is freedom? what are our rights? Frenchmen, you are already free, and Britons are preparing to become so; casting far from us the criminal prejudices arttully inculcated by evil-minded men and wily courtiers, we, instead of natural enemies, at length discover in Frenchmen our fellow-citizens of the world, and our brethren by the samc heavenly Father, who created us for the purpose of loving and mutually assisting each other, but not to hate, and to be ever realy to cuteach other’s throats at the command of weak and ambitious kings, and corrupt ministers; seeking our real encmies, we find them in our bosoms, we feel ourselves inwardly torn by and ever the victim of a restless and all-consuming aristocracy, hitherto the bane of every nation under the sun; wisely have you acted in expelling it from France. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 280 “ Warm as our wishes are for your success, eager as we are to behold freedom triumphant, and man every where restored to the enjoyment of lis just rights, a sense of our duty, as orderly citizens, forbids our flying in arms to your assistance ; our government has pledged the national faith to remain neutral in a struggle of liberty against despotism. Britons remain neutral !—O shame! but we have trusted our king with discretionary powers; we therefore must obey: our hands are bound, but our hearts are free, and they are with you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 281 “ Let German depots act as they please, we shall rejuice at their fall; compassionating however their enslaved subjects, we hope this tyranny of their masters will prove the means of reinstating in the full enjoyment of their rights and liberties millions of our fellowcreatures. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 282 “ With unconcern therefore we view the elector of Hanover,—that is, the king of 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 283 Great Britain—join his troops to traitors and robbers ; but the king of Great Britain will do well to remember, that this country is not Hanover. Should he forget this distinction, we will not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 284 “ While you enjoy the envied glory of being the unaided defenders of freedom, we fondly anticipate in idea the numerous blessings mankind will enjoy; if you succeed, as we ardently wish, the triple alliance (not of crowns, but) of the people of America France, and Britain, will give freedom to Europe, and peace to the whole world. Dear friends you combat for the advantage of the human race; how well purchased will be, though at the expense of much blood, the glorious unprecedented privilege of saying,— Mankind is free: tyrants aud tyranny are no more : , and this is e reigns on the the wesk of Frenchmen. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 285 Gentlemen, this address, which was sent by that society, was followed by another from the Society for Constitutional Information, upon the 9th of November 1792, which seems likewise to state their principles. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 286 “ Servants of a sovereign people, and benefactors of mankind : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 287 “ We rejoice that your revolution has arrived at that point of perfection which will permit us to address you by this title,’—Servants of a sovereign people. That is not the character of a British government; this is the principle of the Southwark resolutions—“ it is the only one which can accord with the character of true legislators. Every successive epoch in your affairs has added something to the triumphs of liberty and the glorious victory of the 10th of August has finally prepared the way for a constitution, which we trust you will establish on the basis of reason and nature. Mr. Barlow had in effect said and they had made him an honorary member, and had transmitted their address by his hands), that no constitution could reform upon the basis of reason and nature, that left aking in the government, however the gor vernment was modified. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 288 They proceed thus in their address— “ Considering the mass of delusion, accumuJated on mankind to obscure their understandy ings, you cannot be astonished at the opposition, that you have met buth from tyrants and from slaves ; the instrument used against you by each of these classes is the same, tor, in the genealogy of human miseries, ignorance is at once the parent of oppression and the child of submission. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 289 “ The events of oer day are proving, that your cause is cherished by the people in all your continental vicinity: that a majority of each of those nations are your real friends, whose governments have tutored them into apparent foes; and that they only wait to be delivered by your arms from the dreadful necessity of fighting against them, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 290 “ The condition of Englishmen is less to be deplored ; here the hand of oppression has not yet ventured completely to ravish the pen from us, nor openly to point the sword at you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 291 ? They then go on to say : “ From bosoms burning with ardour in your cause, we tender you our warmest wishes for the full extent of ts progress and success; it is indeed a sacred cause; we cherish it as the pledge of your happiness, our natural and nearest friends, and we rely upon it as the bond of fraternal union to the human race, in which union our own nation will surely be one of the first to concur. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 292 “ Qur government has still the power and perhaps the inclination to employ hirelings to contradict us; but it is our real opinion, that we now speak the sentiments of a great majority of the English nation. The people here are wearied with imposture, and worn out with war, they heve learned to reflect that beth the age and the other are the offspring of unnatural combinations if society, as relative to systems of government, not the result of the natural temper of nations as relative to each others happiness. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 293 “ Go on, legislators, in the work of human happiness; the benefit will in part be ours, but the glory shall be all your own; it Is the reward of your perseverance, it is the prize of virtue, the sparks of liberty preserved in EngJand for ages, like the coruscations of the Northern Aurora, serving but to show the darkness visible in the rest of Europe. The lustre of the American republic, like an effulgent morning, arose with increasing vigour, but still too distant to enlighten our hemisphere, till the splendour of the French revolution burst forth upon the nations in the full fervour of a meridian sun, and displayed,—attend to the words—“in the midst of the European world the practical result of principle which hilosophy had sought in the shade of speculation, and which experience must every where confirm,—the principles of Mr. Paine, who went over to form one in that convention, the existence of which shows the practical result of those principles, which philosophy had sought, and which experience was to confirm —it dispels the clouds of prejudice from all people, reveals the secrets of all despotism, and creates a new character in man. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 294 “ In this career of improvement, your example will be soon followed; for nations, rising from their lethargy, will reclaim the rights of man with a voice which man cannot resist. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 295 Gentlemen, it will not be matter of surprise to you, that letters, such as these to the National Convention in France, should have produced opinions in that country respecting the attachment of individuals in this to their government. It is not therefore very extraordinary, that, upon the 19th of November 1792, that famous decree passed of fraternization with all subjects in all countries, who chose to resist the governments under which they live; but I think you will be surprised that any men could receive in this country, and read with approbation, and enter upon their proceedings, the answers which these addresses brought from France, and which were read in the presence of the prisoner at the bar, without being astonished that they did not at least take some means to reject from them the imputation that they meant in their own country, all that these answers suppose they mean, and all that these answers promise to assist them in accomplishing. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 296 You will find, upon the 14th of December 1792, that a letter from the Society of the Friends of Liberty and Equality, sitting’ at Laon, the head of the department of the Aisne, to the Patriotic Society of London, called the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 297 “Society for Constitutional Information, is read, and referred to their Committee of Correspondence: it isin these words : The Society of the Friends of Liberty and Equality sitting at Laon, the head of the department of the Aisne, to the Patriotic Society of London, called the Society for Constitutional Information
ATTORNEYGENERAL 299 Gentlemen, they then enter upon the minutes of the society another letter, from another fraternizing society,—whether one of those societies which they speak of in the beinning of 1792, as aftiliating societies in rance, or not, I do not know; whether they had been assisting to reduce their principles into practicedo not know; but it is clear, that the affiliating society in France offered them their assistance for that purpose. Accordingly, you will find that the Society of the Tats of Liberty and Equality, established at Macon, write to the Constitutional Society at London, adverting to what they had said in their address to the nation about the glorious victory of the 10th August 1792, the circumstances of which shall be described to you in evidence, because you will find that some of the persons who are charged in this indictment (and whose conduct in this conspiracy, will, upon the clearest principles of law, affect all of them) were then present in Paris. They write thus—“ Yes, citizens, our brethren and friends, the 10th of August 1792 shall be distinguisled—what, in the annals of France
ATTORNEYGENERAL 301 “ Our first constitution had consecrated them, but had not always taken them for its base : the dominion of the passions, the force of habit, the impression of prejudices, and the power of the intrigues empiged in our Constituent Assembly, found the secret to preserve sufficient authority to our tyrants, to extinguish at some time the sacred rights of nature, and to re-establish despotism on its throne of iron. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 302 ‘ But royalty, thus preserved, was not content with the victory secured to it by a set of men, the greatest part of whom it had corrupted. It was impatient to reap the fruits that it appeared to promise itself; but its too great eagerness has hastened its ruin, and secured the triumph of reason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 303 «¢ The French, proud of their own existence, soon perceived the fruit of their first legislature ; became sensible of the imperfections of their first laws, saw that they made a surrender of the rights of liberty and equality, which they had embraced ;. they roused themselves anew to demand at length laws impartial and humane. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 304 “ From thence the necessary day of the 10th of August 1792, from thence a second revolution, but a revolution, which is only the completion of the first, which has received our vows and our oaths, and which we will bless for ever, if it leads us, as we hope it will, to the happiness of the nation, to the constant maintenance of liberty and equality. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 305 Let intriguers, fools, and tyrants, calumniate us; we despise them too much to condescend to answer them, and seek for their esteem. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 306 “ That which flatters us is the interest that you take in our labours: your attention has contributed to the success of our arms. We desire your esteem, we are proud of your approbation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 307 “ We smile at the expression of the sentiments that you manifested to our representatives. We behold a nation of brethren rouse itself to support the cause of humanity; we behold the brave English adopt our principles, become our friends: we say to each other with pleasure, soon will they become our allies; and uniting our efforts, we shall go on to deliver the universe from the yoke of tyrants, to restore the nations to reason and nature. That day is not far distant, if we may rely on our own courage, and the hope of youralliance. In the mean time, receive our thanks, and corTespond with brethren who set a high value upon your esteem. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 308 Gentlemen, on the 17th of December 1792, the Popular and Republican Society of another department at the mouth of the Rhone, wrote them this letter: he Popular and Republican Society of Apt, department of the Mouths of the Rhone to the Popular Society sitting ut London. Live free or die. Citizens, brethren, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 309 ’ and friends, when two great nations, acquainted with their rights, approximated by their commercial connexions and their national situation, formed to live and to act in concert with each other, begin to form the glorious project of uniting themselves for the regeneration of the human race, one may then say with reason that kings are ripe and ready to fall. How glorious it will be for France and England to have furmed alone a confederacy destructive of tyrants, and to have purchased at the price of their blood the liberty of Europe; we may say more, of the whole universe! Courage, brethren and friends! I¢ is for you to follow in the glorious and hazardous career of the revolution of the world; can you any longer groan under the yoke of a overnment that has nuthing of liberty but the name? for, althuugh your land was inhabited before ours by freemen, can you, with. out delusion, consider your government as such? Will you content yourselves with a partial frecdom? Will the English be satisfied with principles? Will that bold nation, that has produced philosophers the most profound, and that first of all perceived the sparkling rays of freedom, remain a spectatrix in so noble a cause? No, brethren and friends, no? you will soon lift yourselves up against that perfidious court of St. James's, whose infernal policy, like that which found its doom in the Thuilleries, has made so many victims in our two nations, and does disunite them peretually to rule over them. Your love for iberty has fixed your attention upon the wants of our defenders: your generosity towards them has a title to the a kaow ele ment of the republic; we are impatient to furnish you the same advantages: the Popular Societies of France desire ardently the epoch that shall permit them to address their voice to the National Assembly of Great Britain, and to offer to the soldiers of liberty of your nation, arms, bayonets, and pikes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 310 This is the private correspondence between the socictics and the Society for Constitutional Information; but some of the persons named in this Indictment were present at the scenes I am now going to state at the bar of the National Convention in France; others of them delivering these sentiments by their ambassador Mr. Barlow whose principles you have seen, and Mr. Frost, of whom I must state it, because I shall prove it, that he has been convicted in this country of coming from that country with the doctrine of No King; they offer these addresses to the -National Convention of France in terms, the substance of which I will state to you as far as I understand it, to be, and I believe it is an accurate translation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 311 “ Mr. Barlow and Mr. Frost, English citizens, being admitted to the bar, one of them pronounced the following address
ATTORNEYGENERAL 313 “ Citizens of France, we are deputed from the Society for Constitutional Information in London, to present to you their congratulations on the triumphs of liberty. This Society had laboured long in the cause with little prospect of success previous to the commencement of your revolution; conceive then their exultations and gratitude when, by the astonishing efforts of your nation, they beheld the reign of reason acquiring an extension and solidity which promised to reward the labour of all good men, by securing the happiness of their fellow-creatures. nf mrenitas societies of a similar nature are now forming in every part of England, Scotland and Ireland; they excite a spirit of universal inquiry into the complicated abuses of government, and the simple means of areform. Afterthe example which France has given, the science of revolutions will be rendered easy, and the progress of reason will be rapid. It would not be strange if, in a period tar short of what we should venture to predict, addresses of felicitation should cross the seas to a National Convention in England. We are also commissioned to inform the Convention, that the society which we represent has sent to the soldiers of liberty & patriotic donation of a thousand pair of shoes, which are by this time arrived at Calais; and the society will continue sending a thousand pair a week for at least six weeks to come; we only wish to know to whose care they ought to be addressed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 314 Why, gentlemen, am I to be told then, that, in the month of November 1792, those who, in August 1792 had said they could ap
ATTORNEYGENERAL 315 Ply with no effect to parliament, had no idea ! of si uch a National Convention in England as that National Convention in France which they were addressing, and from which they were expecting to receive addresses? Am I to be told that they had no idea of such & convention, as should overturn the constitution of this country? It is impossible to put sucha construction uponsuch proceedings. Gentlemen, you will likewise nd that the president of the Convention thought it necessary to give an answer to this address. I will state the substance of it: it will be read in evidence: therefore I shall not take up time in looking for it. The president considering them as generous republicans (and well he might after what had passed), makes an address to them, expressing much the same sentiments as those 1n which they had addressed him, and then he concludes by saying— “Without doubt the time approaches when we shall soon send congratulations to the National Convention of England. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 316 Gentlemen, you will likewise find that the London Corresponding Society, and the Constitutional Society, endeavoured to excite persons in all parts of this kingdom to send these addresses ; that in point of fact, there are various other addresses sent, of similar import, at the instigation of these societies, and the intent of them, I think, cannot possibly be-misunderstood: but take the intent of them to be what you will, let my learned friend tell you, as he will, that there as yet was no war between Great Britain and France you will allow me to say that there is evidence ofa distinct intent that there should be a National Convention in England, and thet the French soldiers of liberty should assist what they would call the soldiers of our liberty, whether there should be a war between Great Britain and France, or not: and vou will allow me to say, that in that very month of November 1792, a passage occurs, in which France does in effect declare war against ail nations that did not adopt her principles, and allow the people to put them into execution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 317 In a conspiracy, as widely extended as this is, I shall undoubtedly insist, before you and the Court, that the acts of individuals, and particularly the acts of persons sent to present addresses to a foreign country, that what they doin reference to these acts is evidence against all ofthem; and likewise that letters which the persons write relative to the same addresses, are evidence against each of them whether written by the particular individual or no, as being in the prosecution of the same purpose. Upon the 20th of September 1792, Mr. Frost, who was then at Paris, states his Notions in a letter to Mr. Tooke, of the rca! effect of this transaction of the 1uth of August 1792, about which time Mr. Paine made his first appearance in the National Convention —“ Without the affuir of the 10th of August liberty was over—We dine to-day with Petion —Paine has entered his name on the roll of parliament, and went through the forms of office with a great deal of nonchalance—We are well ludged, and beside our bed-rooms, have an entertaining room for members to be shown into, and several have called upon us this morning. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 318 Then you will find, that there being a project to send shoes to the soldiers of France, and arms and muskets, with respect to which project the prisoner was a contributor —for the purpose of having this present trom England to France properly distributed in France, the fullowing letter is written to the mayor of Paris: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 319 “ Sir, You are in no want of friends in England, who ardently wish to be useful tu French liberty; but we wish to know some one of your friends who resides in London, in whow you have af entire confidence, and to whom we may give Our money, in the assurance that it will be remitted to you withont delay, and without fraud. Mr. Frost to whom T entrust this letter, 18 going to set out imme diately with Mr. Paine for Paris, and aliows me ne time for ceremony, if it were necessary. I request you to scnd me the name of some Frenchman in London, merchant, or other, for the purpose above mentioned. We can now begin the public contribution towards our patriotic gift with a -thousard pounds sterling, and I have no doubt’ but it will amount in time to several thousands; if you consider this step in the same point of view that we do, you. will see in it much tuse to the common cause in England and ! by no means such as were cakulated in any 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 320 France. 1 entreat you to give me your sentifrents upon the subject, and to point out to me the means by which I may be useful to This is answered, upon the 1st of October, by Petion,; thus—“ You cannot, sir, doubt of my eagerness to second views so useful, which will for evec merit our gratitude, will zivet the links of fraternity between us, and must duce the greatest advantages to England and France. sending you without delay, the name of the person in whose hands you may place the funds whieh you destine to the support of a cause which, in truth, is that of all people who cherish liberty. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 321 Gentlemen, it may be iti the recollection of perhaps most who now hear me, that circumstances of this sort, which were supposed to be in existence, but, which, in fact, were not capable of being proved to be in existence, had excited in this country considerable alarm in the minds of many persons who live in it. This alarm, it seems to have been thought necessary, both in the Constitutional Society, and-also in the London Corresponding Society, in some degree to lay asleep, as far as it affected them; they thought it necessary, therefore, to give some declaration, as they call it, of their principles, and I will state to you shortly what that was—but the explanation, which the London Corresponding Society gave, was thought so little safe, though it was given for the purpose of laying asleep alarms, that it will be distinctly proved to you—that being written as I am instructed to state to you (and I do it because I am instructed, and it is my duty), ps Rec by Mr. Vaughan, it was agreed to be stuck up round the town at midnight—that aceordingly a person of the name of Carter, a billsticker, was employed for that purpose ; — that sonte tnistake happened betweerhim and his employers; that having made that mistake, he was not thought a proper person to be employed in considerable business in the society afterwards: this mn was taken up in the act of sticking the bills round this town, whieh contains this address—he was prosecuted—he was convicted—and lay six montha in a gaol in consequence of that conviction ; and this was the fate that attended the issuing into the world an address, which was to appear not originally by daylight, but by midnight. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 322 With respect to the address of the Constitutional Society, I think I shall not be thought to make an unfair observation upon it when I say this—that if I had not read to you what I have already read, you would have found it impossible to say what it was, upon reading that paper that they meant to say, who published it; but after what I have read to you T think you can have no difficulty to determine that the paper they published, and the paper of the Corresponding Society, were 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 323 I shall have the honour, sir, of manner to disavow those principles, which I think I have shown you satisfactorily, from March 1792, were the principles they acted upon and adopted. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 324 Gentlemen, the address of the London Corresponding Society is in these words — “ Friends and fellow-countrymen, unless we: are greatly deceived, the time is approaching when the object for which we struggle is likely to come within our reach, That a nation, like Britons, should be free, it is requix site only that Britons should will it, to become so’—that is a passage borrowed trom Mf. Paine—“ that such should be their will—the abuses of our original constitution, and the alarms of our aristocratic enemies, sufficiently witness: confident in the pony of our motives, and in the jastice of our cause, let us meet falsehood with proofs, and hypocrisy with plainness ; let us persevere in declaring our principles, and misrepresentation will nicet its due reward—contempt. In this view the artifices Of a late aristocratic association, formed on the 20th instant call for a few remarks on account of the declarations they have published, relative to other clubs and societies formed in this nation. It is true that this meeting of gentlemen (for so they style themselves) have mentioned no names, instanced no facts, quoted no authoritiesit was a little difficult to do it, unless 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 325 ‘they had the means of seeing all the correspondences at home and abroad but they take upon themselves to assert that bodies of their countrymen have been associated, professing opinions favourable to the rights of man, to liberty and equality’—mark these expressions—“ and moreover that these opinions are conveyed in the terms, no king, no parliament. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 326 Gentlemen, what I have been endeavouring to state to you is this, that it is necessarily to be inferred from their principles that they did mean to assert, when they were ripe for it, no king, no parliament: it is pot my imputation—I do not know whose it was, to which this alludes, that they did express their opinion in the language, no king, no parliament 5 but I say that they expressed their opinions in lan e, whieh, when accutately looked af, as forcibly import the ideas, as if they had used the wine no king, no parliament—“ if this be intended to include the societies to which we respectively belong, we here, in the most solemn manner, deny the latter of the charge
ATTORNEYGENERAL 328 -thus—“ Let us wait and watch the ensuing session of parliament, from whom we have much to hope and little to fear. The House of Commons may have been the source of our calamity, it may prove that of our deliverance; should it not, we trust we shall not prove unworthy of our forefathers, whose exertions in the cause of mankind so well deserve our imitation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 329 Now, gentlemen, I ask, after concluding this letter, what this means—“ if parliament should not do it.If we are ready to admit that parliament is formed upon principles that make it competent to do the thing, if it please to do it, it is all well; but if it will not, then we will not prove unworthy of our forefathers, whose exertions in the cause of mankind so well deserve our imitation—and referring you back te the coeeeapemdts between the Norwich and the London Corresponding Society, to the declaration of the 6th of August 1792, which said they had nothing to look for from parliament—to the correspondence with the National Convention of France—to the conduct, which in the presence of their delegates, was permitted—and never repudiated by any act-of the London Corresponding Society; and referring you, moreover, to the subsequent evidence, which I have to offer to you; I think you will find that the sentiment which is expressed by the author of this paper, upon the 19th of November 1792, was a sentiment which, if followed up by those who continue to hold it, meant that, if parliament did not 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 330 “give them redress, they would have it by their own force. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 331 With respect to the Constitutional Society, all it thinks proper to say upon the subject is this : “ that the object of this society, from its first institution to the present moment of alarm, has uniformly been, to promote the welfare of the people—Ibeg your attention to these words—“ has uniformly been to promote the welfare of the people by all constitutional means.—Now if I were to stop here, with a view to show yeu what you are to understand by the words,—“ all constitutional means—are the means I have been stating unstitutional means? Will it make the means more constitutional than they really are, because thpy choose to call them so
ATTORNEYGENERAL 333 “Resolved, ¢dly—That this society disclaims the idea of wishing toeffecta change in the pe sent system of things by violence and public commotion, but that it trusts to the good sense of the people—You will find, before I have done, that, in April 1793, it could not trust to the sense of the people— when they ehall be fully enlightened on the subject to wre, without disturbing the public tranquillity, an effectual and permanent reform. Resolved, Sdly—That the intentions of this and similar societies have of late been grossly calumniated by those who are interested to perpetuate abuses, and their agents, who have been industrious to represent the members of such societies, as men of dangers ous principles, wishing to destroy all social order, disturb the state of property, and introduce anarchy and confusion instead of regular government. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 334 “ Resolved, 4thly—That, in order to-counteract the operation of such gross aspersions, and to prevent them from checking the proere of liberal inquiry, it is at this time pecoiarly expedient that this and similar societies should publicly assert the rectitude of their prineiples, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 335 “ Resolved—That the said resolutions be adopted, in order for printing in the news rs. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 336 ow I desire any person to read that paper through again, a hen, gentlemen of the jury, if it is relied upon, be 30 good as to ask yourselves what is the definite meaning in any one passage in it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 337 About the same time there is an address from the Manchester Socicty, dated the 14th of Decemher 1792, which appears to have been read in the Constitutional Society, in the presence of the prisoner, and which address some very particular circumstances about it, for you will find that there was a resohution upon the 14th of December 1792, in these words—“ Read a printed address from Manchester—Resolved, that the said address be approved for publishing in the Hemapapers 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 338 It appears by a paper, which I shall produce to you, that the words Read a printed address from Manchester, are in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke; that the address itself is in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke; whether it was a copy of any address at Manchester or not, I do not know : this address appears a! to be in print; it is seut for publication; and with a view to show to the public what extent the Sstniba on of here has arisen to Aan the progress of a treasonable purpose this address was ordered ta be printed, and that a hundred thousand copies of it should be distributed to their correspondents in Great Britain and Ireland
ATTORNEYGENERAL 340 Now, in this paper, which bears date wpon the 14th of December 1792, and recollecting, as I hope you will do, what I have ly stated to you of the principles of those who were concerned in this transaction, as these principles had been manifested in all the other transactions, I have stated to you, you will find there is this passage: he says— To gull the poor witb the insolent falsehood, that the laws are the same for the poor as the rich, or with idle panegyrics on a rotten constitution, which you have not examined, and of whicb you feel not the benefit—The real friends of the people hear with pity and bear with patience the hourly calumnies to which they are exposed ; they entertain, however, no personal enmities, no aversion, but to the enemies of the people, and no disrespect to the constitution, but where it is hostile to the rights of the people. Now, why it is said to be hostile to the tights of the people, I think, can be pretty well understood, after what I have stated to ou about these communications with France, t it need not be left there, for you will find that this is more distinctly stated in the draught of an answer toa letter, which was likewise read and entered among the minutes of this society upon the 6th of October 1792: the draught of the answer scems to have been prepared on the 2nd November 1792 ; it was to be sent to the editors of the Patriot. The editors of the Patriot were persons who were living at Sheffield; and it will appear by the rs, the substance of which I have not really ily strength enough to state to you, were affiliated at the same time with the London Corresponding Society, aud also with the Constitutional Socicty, in the propagation of their paces and this in an extent, which no j|anguage can do justice to, which it is imposable to describe to you without reading a particular letter, in which they themselves state their mode of procceding, and which, for the purpose of informing you in this respect, shall be presently read to you: to one-of them the following is an answer, and I beg your attention to it, of the 2nd of Nov. 1792. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 341 “ We rejoice with you in the increase of the members of the societies of freedom ; our bosoms glow with the sentiments—we are brothers in affection with you, and with the freemen of Stockport’—(who wrate that letter which I before observed upon, which states that nothing can do but a convention, and that their object is a government immediately constituted by the people: that that cannot be while the Crown or the Lords, as you choose to cunstrue the letter, retain their authority)—They add—““ Freedom, though an infant, makes “ Herculean efforts—Now they Meant nothing in the world to the prejudice of the monarchy, they meant nothing in the world but a full representation of the ree inaparliament co-existing with king and lords. They add —“ The vipers, aristocracy, that is, persons who have got coats upon their backs—“ and Monarchy—we have it yet in England, gentlemen—“ are panting and writhin Wnder its grasp: may success, peace, ani happiness attend those efforts! — That letter, so prepared, will be produced to you, with the corrections of Mr. Horne Tooke, in his own hand. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 342 Gentlemen, I have now gone through, as well as I am able,—and I hope you will keep in view the case I have stated,—the principles and practices of these societies, with all their affiliations. I ought to mention to you, that you will find ia the evidence, as itis laid efore you, most uncommon industry in picking up fresh connexions. If a paper appeared in the country, stating that a socicty of any sort was formed, you will find immediate industry to connect them, and affiliate them with the London Corresponding and Constitutional Societies. If these societies professed —as, for instance, the Stockport Society professed—that they would have nothing but a government constituted immediately by themselves, they contrive to give an answer satisfactory to them. If the societies professed attachment to the monarchy, and desired explanation whether they meant Mr. Pitt's plan, which Mr. Paine laughs at, or whether they meant the duke of Richmond’s plan—or whether they meant, as a letter, you will hear by and by, says, to rip up monarchy by the roots, you will find they satisfied them all sufficiently to enlist them all for that purpose, which from their own transactions, I state to be neither more nor less, than to do what Mr. Paine did in his book, to combine the principles, which they stated, when the times were ripe for it, with the practices which were correspondent with those principles; to apply those principles, which were alike the principles of these societies and of the French constitution of 1791, and which Mr. Paine, Mr. Barlow, and those addressers to the convenion, receiving such answers from the convention in 1792, declared bad produced a constitution in France upon the 10th of August 1792, to apply them not to form that, which in its nature is an absurdity, a royal democracy, but that which upon principle is consistent, though it ita wretched bad governMent, a representative government, to be exchanged here in lieu of our limited monarchy, in lieu of our government, under which I state it, with a defiance to the world to tell me that I do not state it truly, that a people never did enjoy, since the providence of God made us a people (you may talk about theories as you please), that they never did enjoy, for so long atime together, such a quantum of actual private happiness and private prosperity, public happiness and public prosperity, under any constitution, as we have enjoyed under the constitution, to the destruction or the support of which it is for you to judge whether such means, as I have been stating to you, were designed to be esuployed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 343 ‘The next thing that was to be done, was to go on in strengthening themselves by affiliation ; and you will fin eager that they have connexions at Norwich, Shefheld, Leeds, and other places: indeed, there was hardly a county, in which they had not affiliated societics, and, if you believe them, to great numbers. The next step they took was, not that they should have it accomplished—their principles would not let them accomplish it—but it was for the purpose of attaching more and more affiliated societies, that they began now to think, in the year 1793, of making applica“tions to parliament. gentlemen, mn the course of that year, 1793, whilst they are to make applications to parliament, you will find that they distinctly discuss the utility of doing so. The London Corresponding Society, it will be proved to you, take the opinion of the socicties in the country with respect to three distinct propositions. Mark this. Now, gentlemen, in September 1792, the Stockport Society told the London Corresponding Society that there was no hope of doing any thing but in a convention; the London Corresponding Society give the answer that I have before stated. They began to think of this thing called a convention in the beginnir g of the year 1793, and they propose having communication, on the other hand, from the country societies. They State three propositions—W hat is it we are to do 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 345 liament did not attend to; I mean petitions to introduce a change in the government upon the principle of annual suffrage and universal Tepresentation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 346 They determined for the present that they would content themselves with petitions: that this would occasion a great deal of debate: that that would give them a vast variety of opportunities of discussing the point they had had in agitation since 1792; and, if the public mind was not ripe for a convention in 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 347 1798, the proceedings and transactions of 1793, had a natural and obvious tendency, when these transactions were made a proper use of, to bring to maturity the project, not yet Come to maturity: you will find therefore that both the London maneeyning Eee and the Society for Constitutional Information keep this object in view. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 348 The Norwich Society, upon the 5th of March 1793, write thus to the Society for Constitutional Information, and which you will see had held correspondence also with the London Corresponding Society upon the subject of the same proposition : “ It is with peculiar satisfaction that we are favoured with your correspondence,—they first ssy—“ We wish to find out a method of redress; at present we see a great propriety in universal suffrage and annual elections; but we beg will be obliging enough to inform us of wl you have collected of the sense of the people by your correspondence: we have to inform you that our worthy Corresponding Societies of London have recently submitted three propositions for our investigation ; first, whether a petition to parliament, or an address to the king, or a convention. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 349 When I find here the word convention, I think I may address this question to you as nen of common sense; if, in August 1792, the London Corresponding Society, by the address which I have read to you, have told you distinetly that they cannot get any redress from parliament, is it not marvellous how it is to be made out in argument, that, in March 1793, they were to have a convention in ordet to get it from parliament, and more i larly to get it from that parliament, which, upon their owp principles was not tent to give it, if they had a mind to take it from parliament? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 350 “ Permit us briefly to state our views for your revisal ; and with respect to the first, we behold we are a conquered people; we have tamely submitted to the galling yeke, and resistance in the present circumstances is vain; we cannot, we cannot act the man; and, 88 necessity has no law, we think ourselves under that degrading necessity to state our grievances to the House of Commons, with a request for redress; and should they refuse— which they did—“ to grant our reasonable petition, we have still got (no thanks to them)—here is an accurate, a short descrij tion of the affiliated societies—“ a formidab! engine, that will couvey the insult to the remotest parts of the kingdom: as to the propriety of the second, we wish to submit to your superior judgment, and should esteem it a favour to be informed of the result; fer at Present we are dubious of its good conseuences. Lastly, a cunvention ; and oh! that the period were arrived; but in the present state of affairs, alas! it is impracticable ; yet this is the object we pursue, and esteem any other means only in subordination to, and as having a tendency to accomplish that able end. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 351 “ We wish to be in unison with. our breahren and fellow labvurers, and should be glad of any information, as soon as it is convenient; and we beg your advice whether it is necessary, as soon as possible, to collect signatures to a petition for a real representation of the people 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 352 This letter, of the 5th of March 1793, having been received from Norwich, you will find that Mr. Frost, who had then lately come from France, and was about that time, I believe, talking of no king in this country, in which it is not yet quite lawful to say so, was thought an extremely proper pergon to draw up a letter in answer to this; and accordingly it is stated upon the books of the society, that Mr. Frost was ordered to prepare that answer: however, it got into abler- hands; for, unless i am again misinstructed, it was settled by counsel, and the substance I will now read to you. It is dated the 16th of April 1793. “ From the seeretary of the Society for Constitutional Information to the secretary of the United Political Societies at Norwich
ATTORNEYGENERAL 354 “ That the constitution of England has no more of that character it once possessed ; that the supposed democracy of the country has become a matter of property and privilege ; and that we have therefore no longer that mixed government, which our adversaTies are praising, when they know it is no longer in our possession, are facts notorious and indisputable: where then are we to look for remedy 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 356 Now, who are ourselves? why, those affiliated societies! “ ourselves represented in some meeting of delegates for the extensive purpose of reform, which-we suppose you understand by the term convention. The Norwich Society writes to the Constitutional Society, and it proposes a convention as the only means of doing this business. The Constitutional Society states that it is to be done only in a convention,—of what? of themsclves. Why then, I say, upon the 16th of April, 1798, the Constitutional Society construed the acts of the 20th of January, 1794, which I shall allude to presently, and the 27th of March, 1794, because the Constitutional Society, said that a convention was a convention of themselves, represented in some meeting of delegates,—and for what purpose ? for the extensive purposes of reform; how ? byapplyingtoparliament? No. Why, thispassage states expressly that the reason why they would have a convention was, because they would not apply to parliament; and canIimpute to men of understanding, that are employed in this business, for there ere merf of understanding enough employed in this business; whether that understanding is. properly employed in this business, it is not for me to say any thing about—can I impute any thing so absurd to men of understanding as that they meant to form a convention, which convention should carry their petition to parliament? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 357 t is the end of each of these propositions that we ought to look to; and, as success in a good cause must be the effect of perseverance and the rising reason of the time, let us determine with coolness, but Ict us persevere with decision. As to a convention, we regard it as a plan the most desirable and most practicable ;—when? so soon as the great body of the people shall be virtuous enough to joinusin the attempt? No—but “so soon as the great hody of the people shall be courageous and virtuous enough to join usin the attempt. You will see whether the interpretation which I give of the word “ courageous by the manner in which I mean to expressit, is due to it or not, by what I have to state to you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 358 Gentlemen of the jury, with a view to explain this thing called a convention, as contradistinguished from parliament, give me leave to carry back, your attention for a moment to January 25, 1793. In this society, which, in November, 1792, had the correspondence with France, which I stated, in January, 1793, when we were on the eve ofa war, and upon the eve of a war which had been produced by the “principles which brought fraternization into’ this, country, and took place soon after that decree of 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 359 November,. 1792, you will find that these resolutions were come to “ That citizen St. Andre, a member of the National Convention of France,—that convention which had deposed a king, as that which could not exist ina government, formed upon the principles of the rights of man, as disclosed by Mr. Paine, his fellow-member in that convention,—“ as one of the most judicious and enlightened friends of human liberty, be admitted an associated honorary member of this society
ATTORNEYGENERAL 361 “ Resolved, that citizen Roland, being also considered by us as one of the most judicious and enlightened friends of human liberty, be admitted an associated honorary member. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 362 Gentlemen, I particularly request your attention to this—“ that the speeches of citizen St. Andre and citizen Barrere, associated honorary members of this society, as given in the Gazette Nationale, ou Moniteur universel of Paris, on the 4th, 6th, and 7th of January, 1793, be inserted in the books of this society ;—and, as far as this society could effectuate it, they endeavoured also to have these resolutions, lished in the newspapers, and it will be 1n proof to you that, in the books of the society, it is resolved that each of these resolutions should be so published. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 363 Now, gentlemen, I shall prove to you, by evidence completely effectual for that purpose, what these speeches were, and then, if you will be so good as to ask yourselves what the Constitutional Society, which in January and February ordered these speeches to be published, meant by a convention in that letter of the 16th of April, 1793, you will judge whether that convention was to be the means Vege they would neither apply to the ing, the executive power, nor to the parliament), was to be the means of handing their application to parliament or whether, on the other hand, it was to be the means of introducing by its own force, a representative procrmnent in this country? that assembly, which you will find, they insist would for the time absorb all the powers of government, which, if it did exist, would delegate its legislative power only so long as they chose to delegate it, a body competent to create a legislature, and possessing within itself an eternal power of reform, an eternal source of revolution. With respect to St. Andre, speaking to the convention, he says, “ Your right to decide the fate of kings arises from your being a revolutionary assembly created by the nation —a- revolutionary assembly created by the nation in such a state is at least that thin which I think no good Englishman ever wil wish to exist to see—“ a revolutionary assembly, created by the nation in a state of insurrection. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 364 Speaking of the trial of the king of France, mee This proceeding is of the highest importance to public order, absolutely necessary to the existence of liberty, aud connected with whatever is held most sacred by the nation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 365 he people of Paris—This is upon the question whether the person of the king be ioviolable, a maxim unquestionably true ia the constitution of this country, a maxiot perfectly consistent with the civil liberties of the people, because, though the king’s person is inviolable, he has advisers, who are violable as to every act that he does—“ The people of Paris, by making a boly insurrection against the king on the 10th of Angie —that 10th of August, which, in Mr. t's letter to Mr. Tooke, was absolutely necessary to the existence of liberty in France—“ deigs him of his character of inviolability. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 366 he people of the other departments, applauded this insurrection, and adopted the consequence of it. The people have therefore formally interposed to destroy this royal inviolability. The tacit consent of the Lk rendered the person of the king inviolable; the act of insurrection—I pry heaven defend us from the operation of such principles in this country—“ the act of insurzection was a tacit repeal of that consent, and was founded on the same grounds of law as the consent itself; the king’s person is inviolable only with relation to the other branches of the legislature, but not with relation to the people. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 367 Now, I ask, what did those gentlemen, who ordered this speech to be published, that the king’s person is inviolable only with relation to the other branches of the legisla ture, when they were talking of conventions, mean? Iam sorry to say that my mind is drawn to the conclusion that they thought the king’s person was not inviolable with ree lation to the people, a convention of whons was to be formed, and was to be formed because an application to parliament was useless. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 368 Now, let us see the description of a convention. “ A convention differs from an ot dinary legislature in this respect: a legisla ture is only a species of superintending magistracy, a moderator of the powers of government: a convention is a perfect representation of the sovereign: the members of the legislativeassembly acted in August upon these principles, in sammoning the conyention; they declare—precisely as it is declared in the letter I have been reading to you—“ that they saw but one measure which could seye France, namely, to have recourse to the supreme will of the people, and to invite the yee to exercise immediately that upalienale right of sovereignty, which: the constitu: tion had acknowledged, and which it could not subject to any restriction: the public interest required that the people should manifest their will by the election of a Nasional 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 369 Convention, formed of representatives in vested by the people with unlimited powers. The people did manifest their will by the election of that convention. The convention being assembled is itself that sovereign will which ought to prevail. It would be contrary to every principle to suppose that the convention js not alone exclusively the expression of the general will. i 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 370 “¢ The powers of the convention must, from the very nature of the assembly, be unlimited with respect to every measure of general safety, such as the execution of a tyrant. It is no longer a convention, if it has not power to judge the king: a convention is a constituent body, i. e. a body that is to make a constitution ior the people; a legislature makes laws ler an established constitution, and in conformity to it. It is despotism when, in the ordinary and permanent establishment ofa state, there is no separation of powers ; but it is of the very essence of a constituent body to concentre ‘be the time all authority: it is the very nature of a national convention, to be the tempo image of the nation, to unite in itself all the powers of the state, to saploy them against the enemies of liberty, and to distribute them in a new social compact called a constitution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 371 Gentlemen, after I have stated that to you, I think I cannot possibly be mistaken when I conceive that you can do no otherwise than put the same construction upon this letter which I did. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 372 I will now take the liberty of calling your attention to a letter of the 17th of May 1793, and the answer of the 26th May 1793, passing over a tt many letters, the substance of which you will inform yourselves of by having read, namely, letters that prove affiliations solicited and granted to Leeds, Tewkesbury, Coventry, and many places in the kingdom, more numerous than I apprehend bt will believe, till you see what the numof them is, by evidence actually before 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 373 Re ou. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 374 Gentlemen, I beg leave now to call your attention, in order of time, to a letter of the 17th May 1793, for it begins a correspondence Most excessively material with that part of country in which the convention has been already held ; I mean Scotland; a convention which, I think I shall satisfy you, did, for the time, act upon the principles that I have stated to you, from the speech of Barrere, as far as it could act, and in which I think, at the moment that I address you, if it had not been stopped in the execution of its purposes, and had been joined by those whose acts we are considering this day, you might have seen, in the speeches of a national convention in Great Britain, a repetition of the language of Barrere, instead of hearing it from me in a court of justice. Gentlemen, I hold it, in the office that I fill, to be due to the administration of the jus
ATTORNEYGENERAL 375 Uce of this country, to say distinctly, if 1 un- i derstand the case upon which certain persons were tried for the acts which they did in Scotland, that, if they had been tried tor high treason, they would have no right to complain; no right to complain if the question upon their conduct had been agitated in that shape before a jury of the Sout Gentlemen, upon the 17th of May, a Mr. Urquhart going from London, Mr. Hardy, and a Persea of the name of Margarot, celebrated in the future history of this business, join, and write a letter—parliament had, as the expected it would, and as they meant it should, rejected their petition—he London Cor. responding Society eagerly seizes the opportunity of Mr. Urquhart going back to Edinburgh, to request of your society a renewal of correspondence, and a more intimate co-operation in that which both societies alike seck, viz. a reform in the parliamentary representation. We are very sensible that no society can by itself bring about that desirable end : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 376 let us, therefore, unite as much as possible, not only with each other, but with every other society throughout the nation. Our petitions, you will have learned, have bean all of them unsuccessful: our attention must now, therefore, be turned to some more effectual means; from your suciely we would wil. lingly learn them, and you, on your part, may depend upon our adopting the firmest measures, provided they are constitutional, and we hope the country will not be behindhand with us. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 377 Now, by “constitutional measures, it is clear that they meant that a convention, as contradistinguished from a parliament, would be constitutional: it is clear they meant it, because they have said it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 378 Then Mr. Skirvingwrites thus — “ Mr. Urquhart did me the pleasure to call on Thursday afternoon, and delivered your letter of the 17th inst. I am much pleased with the contents of it, and shall lay it before the first meeting of our societies here, which, however, does not take place till Monday sevennight. I would have acknowledged the receipt of your favour by yesterday’s post, but was tou much employed in removing our household to another leising to attend to any thing else. NowI beg your attention to this, because you will see in the transactions of the ople in convention in Edinburgh, that they looked to what they were todo in case of a rebellion as well as any other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 379 feither you in England or we in Scotland should attempt separately, the reform which we, I trust, seek to obtain, we should, by so doing, only expose our weakness, and manifest our ignorance of the corruption which opposes our important undertaking ; if we sought only the extirpation of one set of interested men from the management of national affairs, that place might be given to another set; without affecting the vitals adverse to the system of reform, these might be easily accomplished: but to cut up deep and wide rooted prejudices, to give effectual ener, to the dictates of truth in favour of public virtue and national prosperity, in opposition to self and all its interested habits, and to withstand and overawe the final efforts of the powers of darkness, is the work of the whole, and not ofa part; a work to which mankind till this awfu' poe were never adequate, because never till pow disposed to fraternize, not merely or only, I trust, from the sense of the common danger to which we are exposed, but from the ennobling principle of universal benevolence. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 380 I know no greater service that I can do my country, than to promote the union you so wisely desire: and I am happy to assure you, that I have bitherto discovered no sentiment in our association, adverse to the most intimate and brotherly union with the associations in England. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 381  think the minds of all must in the nature of things be now turned to more effectual soa of reform. Not one person was convinced of the necessity of it by the most convincing arguments of reason, together with the most unequivocal expressions of universal desire. What then is to be hoped for from repetition? Iam only afraid that the bow in England against reform was so contracted, that in returning it may break. You would willingly learn, you say, from us—I own that we ought to be forward in this: we have at once in great wisdom perfected our plan of organization, and if we were in the same independent state of mind as the people of England, we would be able to take the lead, the associations with you are no more, I fear, excuse my freedom, than an aristocracy for the good of the people: they are indeed moderate, firm, and virtuous, and better cannot be; but we are the people themselves, and we are the first to show that the people can both Jute and resolve, if undirected by faction, with both wisdom and moderation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 382 “I have not a higher wish in the present exertions for reform than to see the people universally and regularly associated, because Tam persuaded that the present disastrous engagements will issue in ruin, and the people must then provide for themselves; and it would be unhappy when we should be ready to act with unanimity, to be occupied about organization, without which, however, anarchy must ensue—we will not need but to be prepared for the event—to stand still and see the salvation of the Lord—let us therefore take the hint given us by our opposers; let us begin in earnest to make up our -minds relative ig Pe extent of aber which r ought to seek, be prepared to justify it, and to controvert objections : let us model the whole in the public mind; let us provide every stake and stay of the tabernacle which we would erect, so that when the tabernacles of oppression in the ‘palaces of ambition are brokea down, under the madness and folly of their supporters, we may then, without anarchy aud all dangerous delay, erect at once our tabernacle of righteousness, and may the Lord himself be in it! 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 383 Gentlemen, these are things all very easy tobeunderstood. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 384 “ How hurtful to the feelings of a reflecting mind, to look back to the wretched state in which the Roman monarchy, eafeebled and broken by its own corruptions, left the nations, which it subjected, like sheep without a shepherd; they soon became a prey to every invader, because there was mone to gather and unite them; had they, foreseeing the evil, associated for mutual defence, -no robber would have been able to enslave them ; would have given laws to all parties, as as to themselves: all separate colonies and nations would have sought their alliance ; but not having virtue to associate, and heal the divisions, and root out the selfish spirit, which ambition-fostering governments procure to their subjects, they fell under oppressions, from under whose iron sceptre they have never yet been able to deliver themselves. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 385 “ We may suppose an event, which we deprecate; nay, should we not be prepared for every possible issue of the present unprecedented divisions of- mankind, we have a right to be apprehensive of the abilities of our own managers, who are so afraid to depart from recedent, that, like men of detail, they may e inadequate to the task of preserving the vessel from shipwreck, now grappling with danger not only great, but new and uncommon. If the present ministry fail, who after them shall be trusted? It requires little peNnetration to see the anarchy and discord which will follow; it will be such, teh thing short of a general union ai people themselves, will be able to heals baste therefore to associate, at least to be to associate; if, then, such a broken state of things should take place, the civil broils that ane necessarily ensue, would soon subside before the united irresistible voice of the whole. Do not, I entreat you, hesitate’ thinking such a work premature as yet,— this is written in May 1793; but a month, and then it may be too late; a malignant party may be already formed, and only waiting for the halting of the present menagers; it will then be too late to seek to subject to deliberation, after a party has dared the act of rebellion. Jf you go po further than separate meetings in different towns, we will not be able to confide in yous con fraternity, because while in such a state you may be but the tools of a faction; we have all confidence and unite with all affection in one assembly of commissioners from all countries of the world. Gentlemen, observe that expressica ; this letter, in the beginning of it, speaking with reference to the war, does. not know but the palaces of ambition may be all overset; the illars will tumble with’ their supporters. Then it says, “ we could have all confidence and unite with all affection in one assembly commissioners from all countries of the world —if we knew they were chosen by the unbiassed voice of the people, because they would come up with the same disinterested views and desires as ourselves, having all to a common centre of union and interest; but we could not confide in fellowcitizens, who kept aloof from such union, and would not previously affiliate in one great and indivisible family. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 386 Gentlemen, I have befote told you, that there was a society at Birmingham. Upon the 10th of June 1793, the London Corresponding Society writes to that Society in these terms: “ it is with singular satisfaction the Committee of the London Corresponding Society received your letter; they are very giad to see the spirit of freedom springing up in Birmingham, and they make no doubt but that the zeal of your Society and the increase of your numbers will soon do away the stigma thrown on your town by the unjustifiable behaviour of a Church and King mob: ‘we are entirely of your opinion. with regard to the necessity of a general union, and we believe, as you do, that when once the country shall have so united,—what then? “ the Neroes of the day will be forced to yield to the an demand of a long and sore oppressed entlemen, the political societies at Norwich also write to the London Corresponding Society with respect to this Convention upon the 25th of June 1793, in which they say, “ we also received your friendly letter prior to that wherein you stated three propositions: first, a petition to his majesty, or to parliaament, or a national convention; and ordered one of our committee to answer it ; should be glad if you will inform me whether it was attended to.’ I gave my opinion on the subJect to the Constitutional Society of London, and found their ideas congenial to my own, —thatalludes to the letter they wrote him,—viz. an address to the king—futile; a petition to parliament (as a conquered people)— tolerable; a national convention GE crutenstances admitted), best of all. ‘Gentlemen, you will find that, upon the 28th of June 1793, whilst these societies were holding so much correspondence with y Tespect to thie national convention, as the only effectual mcans, it was thought an address to the nation should be prepared: that is not immaterial, because you will find afterwards, that the project of a national convention in Scotland was thought by many of the members of it, and many of the members of those bodies, to have failed for want of such a previous address to the nation; and upon this occasion two gentlemen are brought. together, I do not know whether one of them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 387 at that time was s member of the society or not, but two members are brought together, Mr. Horne Tooke and a borer of the name of Yorke, who, you will find, was a delegate ofto the convention in Scotland, and who you will find has acted a considerable other parts of this country, were to ployed in preparing that address. Upon the 6th of July 1793, a letter havin; been feceived from the political socintes de Norwich, theanswer, signed by the prisoner at the bar, is given in these terms':“Fellow-citizens, the London Cotresponding Society have received, and: read with pleasure, your letter of the 25th of Jane ;' bit the answer, which you mention to‘have been made to our three questions, has not by come to hand; we shall be glad to be i formed by your next whether it was ever ‘put in the post-office. i “ie 6 “With regard‘te the questions themselves, however individuals may have made up thelr mitids on them, the public seeincd most to approve the mode of petitioning parliament. Then it states the effect oF the petitions, ‘“ Exhorting you therefore to throw aside all unavailing complaint, we wish you to occupy yourselves in instructing the people, in intrdducing and maintaining order and regularifs in your own society, and in forming a junctio’ with all others associated for the same putpose throughout the nation, by keeping up’a constant correspondence with them; but, above all, orderly and courageously preparin yourself for the event,"—now mark the event,— “ for, as it is natural to suppose that those, who now pe on the public, will not willingly yield up their enjoyments, nor repossess us of our rights without a struggle, which by their be haviour in Ireland,—that alludes to the bill in Ireland to prevent a convention,—" wehave some reason to think they are meditating, and perhaps may intend to effect by means of those Joreign mercenaries, who ure now paid by the sweat of our brow, and whom, under some plausible pretence, it would be no difficult ! matter to land on our shore: it may be morepantageous to humanity to show them at firstthat their opponents are neither mob nor rabble, but an indignant oppressed people, in wham is not yet entirely extinct the valour of their foree fathers. . A e gentlemen, in a letter to Hertford, which is written by the same Correspending Society, upon the Sist of July 1793, and which Socie' at Hertford had desired to know their princt ples, they state themselves in the same manner; “ We receive with pleasure your assurance of co-operating with us fora reform in parliament, en object to which all our endeavours tend, and on which our hearts arp invariably fixed; but as your declaration that you will not pledge yourselves to demand universal suffrage and annual parliaments, is followed by no specific plan of reform of your another set; without affecting the vitals ad-sion in’ the ‘palaces “of verse to the system of reform, these might bedown, under the easily accomplished: but to cut up deep and supporters, we may. wide rooted prejudices, to give effectual energyand all dangerous to the dictates of truth in favour of publictabernacle of righ’ . virtue and national prosperity, in opposition tohimself be in it 0 ee..self and all its interested habits, and to with- gentlemen, theseare stand and overawe the final efforts of theto be understood. i powers of darkness, is the work of the whole,“ How hurtful to th and not ofa part ; a work to which mankinding mind, to look bac! —

Having thus unequivocally stated our principics, we shall conclude by observing, that the “Dill just passed in Ireland is of a nature to Bwaken the jealousy of every friend to freedom and humanity—will render every exertion justifiable, should a similar attack upon conBtitutional freedom be attempted here. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 405 ‘. In October 1798, the Scotch Convention having met, of which we have all of us heard 80 Touch out of this place, you will find that a etter had been received from a Mr. Sinclair, together with an address from Sirving who Was secretary to the Convention and Friends of the People in Scotland, by the London Constitutional Society; an extraordi meeting of the Society was therefore called, by the Crown and Anchor, to consider the wtility and propriety of sending delegates to a convention of delegates. of the different societies in Great Britain, at Edinburgh, for the purpose of obtaining a parliamentary reform. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 406 Upon the 28th of October 1798, this society came to a resolution to send delegates to that convention, and the two persons elected were Mr. Sinclair and Mr. Yorke; and perhaps one cannot state a more striking. instance of the extraordinary power of a small society, afflating itself with societies, spread all over the whole kingdom, than by stating that Sinclair, who was deputed from this society, meeti with other delegates in Scotland, bad no di culty of assuming with others the title of a delegate to the British Convention—to assert their right to do acts in contradiction to the legislature—than by telling you, that this Yorke and Sinclair were deputed from this society by a poll, in which he, who had the majority, had seventeen votes only; My. Yorke and Mr. Sinclair are accordingly scot down, and they go with all the delegation of the power of the people, which this Constitutional Society, thus affiliated, could give them, and what they thought it was you will see presently
ATTORNEYGENERAL 408 ‘gasp—one or two caurpaigns more will terminate its existence. “We are glad to see that you ‘begin to make a proper use of delegation; where 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 409 ‘bodies of men are too numerous to be convened easily on every occasion, delegation is 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 410 “the best, and indeed the only way to obtain the general opinion. Scotland, iniproving on the idea, have ot only summoned their tw delegates, but also invite those of every other society to attend a kind of convention (as if Mr. Hardy knew nothing about it), “ which is to be held at Edinburgh on the 29th instant, the enclosed paper, which I, previous to the communicating your letter to our committee (which will meet only to-morrow), make haste to tranemit to you, will show you that your society is included in the general invitation to send delegates to that peste which we exhort you to do. if you possibly can; I firmly believe our society will not miss the opportunity of doing the same. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 411 ‘Now you will find that, upon the 5th of October 1793, Hardy, who wrote this letter upon the 17th, wrote to Skirving in this way 2—“ With pleasure I peruse your favour of the 2ad instant, but, as yet, have scen nor heard nothing ‘of the two copies’ of Mr. Muir’s trial, which you mention as being sent to the society and to myself—be kind enough, notwithstanding, to return that gentleman thanks for his polite attention, and assure him that we view him in the light of a martyr to freedom, as well as Mr. Palmer, and that our warmest bh are, that the oppressors of mankind will either be ashamed or afraid of carrying their revengeful malice into executron 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 412 «The General Convettion, which you mention, appears to Mr. Margarot (to whom alone E have communicated your letter) and myself te be a very excellent measure, und as such, I cordd wish you, without delay, to communicate it officially to our society without any ways mentraning thut have written to me prisutely— if in your official letter you should sequire us 80 send a deputation to that meeting, I have no doubt tut our society would, with pleasure, accept the invitation ; andIain persuaded it may do much good
ATTORNEYGENERAL 414 You are right; itis true, that we ‘have hed another general meeting, at which a hastily composed and suddenly produced address to the king was read, applauded, and tobe presented ; but, on a cool revisal, the said address being found to be more 1iPnabired om spirited, more dengerous in its lan e, than advantageous in its object, feaider being too long, the committee, with the approbation of the majority of the society, have adopted anomuch safer, more apposite, relating solely to the war: enclosed you have a copy of it; but-you was misinformed when you was, told we passed any resolutions at that meeting, for we only came to one, and that rather of a private nature, namely, that the conduct of sir James Sanderson, in preventing ‘the meeting of the London’ Corresponding ‘Society, at. the Globe tavern, Fleet street, was of such’ a nature s to place him below our censure. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 415 Gentlemen, the London Constitutional -Society gave their delegates, Mr. Yorke and Mr. Sinclair, certain instructions: and I ought’ here to tell you, -by way of explaining the effect of whatam now to state, that the’ manner of ‘keeping the books of the London Constitutional Society, as I understand it, was this—The resolutions, made upon one night,’ were taken upon loose minutes, either by the’ secretary, or by other persons, who acted in his absence, or in his presence, when he was not. doing that duty himself: they were entered before the subsequent night of meeting, regularly. in the book, and the first thing done upon the' subsequent night of meeting was to read the’ resulutions which were made upon the former night, and to see that they were correct: now it will naturally occur that the minutes may explain the book, and the book may explain the minutes: now, when they come to drawthe minutes, which you will have for the insteuction of their delegates ata convention, which was to be held in Scotland, the first’ ided was, toinstruct those delegates, to petition parliament; but they seem to have recollected that that wasa measure, which had been’ abandoned some months before by all the societies with whom they were affiliated: they therefore struck out of their minutes the purpose of applying to parliament, and they send instructions in these words : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 416 “ The delegates are instructed, on the part of the society, ty assist in bringing forward and supporting any constitutional measures fer procuring a real representation of theCommons of Great Hritain in parliament— that, in specifying the redress to be demanded of existing abuses, the delegates ought never! to lose sight of the two essential principles, general suffrage and annual representation, together with the unalienable right in the poopie to reform, and that a reasonable and nown compensation ought to be made to‘ the representatives of the nation by a national contribution. What they meant by the representatives of the nation, after what I have already read to you, I think you cannot possibly mistake. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 417 London Correspanding Society are’ somewhat bolder in the instructions, which they send with their delegates to the convention in Scotland : you will find these instructions are to the following effect : By article the 1st, the delegate is instructed “ that he shallon no account depart from the original object and principle of this society; namely, the obtaining annua! parliaments, and universal suffrage, by rational and lawful means. 2d. To support the-opinions that representatives in parliament ought to be. paid by their constituents, : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 418 ““7th, That itis the duty of the people now, gentlemen, I beg your attention to this; it is the principle, upon which the convention in Scotland was formed, and upon which it acted: “ That it is the duty of the people to resist uny act of parliament, repugnant to the original principles of the constitution, as would be every attempt to prohibit associations for the purpose of reform. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 419 Gentlemen, there is no government in this country, if this principle is to be acted upon, because nobody can tell to what extent it will Bo and accordingly you will see that these lelegates, who went into Scotland, with this authority in their hands, carried the authotity far beyond the resistance, which they were authorized to make according to the principles t:ere laid down, and they state a preat variety of cases, all approved afterwards oth by the London Corresponding, and the Constitutional Society, in which the people, and the convention of the people, were to resist parliament. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 420 Gentlemen, these societies having sent delegates to the conyention in Scotland, I proceed now to state that the acts of that convention, to the extent at least to which the delegates from this country were authorized to act, are evidence against those who sent them and therefore against the persons here indicted. But farther, they communicated to the societies here, particularly to the prisoner at the bar, their acts; and the societies here, in distinct resolutions, acting upon consideration, approved their whole conduct: they therefure made that conduct of their delegates in the convention in Scotland, whether it was agrecable to the original authority which was given them, or not, their own; they adopted ut by giving it their subsequent approbation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 421 Gentlemen, you will find, first of all, that they received a letter from the Sheffield Society, athliating with them, in which it was Proposed to determine like Englishmen. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 422 After receiving a great deal of other correspondence, which I will not trouble you with reading, the societies here prepare to send delegates to Scotland. Mr. Skirving sent a circular letter upon the arrival of the English delegates to the delegates of all the associations in Scotland, which were extremely numerous, and very widely extended; and I think the delegates of these difterent societies came together to the number of one hundred and eighty. After sitting some time, Mr. Marrot, you will find, who was the delegate of the London Corresponding Society, represents to the body there met—“ That the societies in London were very numerous, though sometumes fluctuating ; that in some part of England whole towns are reformers: that in Sheffield and the environs there are fifty thousand ; that in Norwich there are thirty societies in one; that if they could get a convention of England and Scotlan , they might represent six or seven hundred thousand males, which is a majority of all the adults in the kingdom. — 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 423 You will find Mr. Margarot moves, that, previous to publishing an address to the public a committee should be appointed to consider the means, and draw up a plan of general union and co-operation—between what? Not between any societies in the two nations, but a plan of general union and co-operation between the two nations. In their constitutional parent of a theory of parliamentary reform, they stylejthemselvesa convention, and this, gentlemen, is extremely material for Pi to attend to; they style themeelves, “ The British Convention of the delegates of the people associated to obtain universal s and annual parliaments. Then I ask what is a convention of the people according to these societies? According to the proceedings in Scotland, a convention of the people is a convention of the delegates from s0cieties in England and Scotland. They assert that the people have in them all civil and political authority; and they, repeatedly, again and again, from the moment that this convention was formed in Scotland to the moment of its dispersion, more especially at the time of its dispersion, more especially still from the time of its dispersion tll the time of a meeting on the 20th of January, at the Globe tavern; and on the 27th of March, when another convention was proposed, as I stated at the outset, they repeatedly and in the most pressing terms state that now or never was the time, when the people were to meet, when they were to act by their own force, when they were courageously to prepare themselves for the event, and to show those whom they called their oppressors and plunderers, that they were a brave people, in whom valour was not extinct. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 424 Having thus met together, upon the principles of the French system, which took place on the 10th of. August 1792, they proceed directly to the French practices, which took place then in the National Assembly of France, took place then hecause the people of France were understood to be represented by aconvention ; these delegates taking upon themselves also to be aconvention of the people, they instituted Primary Societies, they divided the country into departments, they appointed provincial assemblies, they have Committees of Union, they thank for patriotic donations, they assume an epoch, they appoint a Secret Committee to be called together upon extraordinary emergencies; and upon the 28th of November 1793, they come toa resolution, to which I must beg your most serious attention. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 425 Gentlemen of the jury, you will remember that they went with authorities, which stated to them that it was the duty of the people, which people they had taken upon themselves to represent, to resist any act of parliament, that should be made for a parti purpose. It is hardly, I think, to be contended, that the pat bulk of the people of this country, ; ing wrongous imprisonment and against unppy in their political existence, as undoubtedly they are, remaining happy in their political existence, because they do not teel grievances (till they are taught by malignant industry to believe that they exist), I mean to such a degree as to call for measures of this sort, could believe that the legislature of the country, doing justice to the subjects, whoin it is bound to protect, would permit a proceeding of this kind to go on—yet, gentlemen, confiding su much as these persons did in the supposed state of their number-in that coun- ; try, and of those who were to be connected with them in this, you will find that, upon the 28th of November 1793, one of the persons belonging to that convention, citizen Sinclair, I think, the members all standing up upon their feet, for the greater solemnity of the thing, proposes this resolution— Resolved that the following declaration and resolutions be inserted at the end of our minutes—“ That this convention—now if it be possible to say that any convention means to act asa con- , yention of the people, it is that which sets itselfabove the legislature in the act it is doing —“ that this convention, considering the ca-lamitous consequences of any act of the legislature, which may tend to deprive the whole or any part of the people of their undoubted right to meet, either by themselves or by delegation, to discuss any matter relative to their common interest, whether of a public or private nature, and holding the same to be totally inconsistent with the first principles and safety of society, and also subversive of our known and acknowledged constitutional liberties
ATTORNEYGENERAL 427 Gentlemen, permit me to. call your attention to this, that this declaration, in its principles, follows the instructions that they had teceived, that, if any attempt was made to bring in a convention bill, they were then to doso and so. They then proceed thus—“ do declare before God and the world, that we shall tollow the wholesome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act, which shall militate against the constitution of our country’—That 1s saying, that the will of the legislature is not a better judge of what is an act against the constitution of the country, than the affiliated clubs at Edinburgh—“ and shall continue to assemble and consider of the best means by which we can accomplish a teal representation of the people, is that a parliament 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 429 “ And we do resolve that the first notice fiven—The first notice—parliament is not even to discuss the thing; but, if an intimation of it ismade in parliament—“ That the notice given for the introduction of a conYention bill, or any bill of a similar tendency to that passed in Ireland in the last session of their parliament, or any bill for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus act, or the act for preventdue delays in trials in North Britain, or in case of an invasion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 430 Gentlemen, I call back to your recollection the letter of Skirving—I call back to your recollection not only the letter of Skirving, but that the troops of liberty were promised to be sent with bayonets and pikes from that country, which at this moment was likely to invade us—“ or the admission of any foreign troops whatsoever, into Great Britain or Ire land—If the parliament of this country, for the purpose of protecting itself against that foreign invasion, had brought these foreign troops into Great Britain or Ireland, not being the troops of a nation with which we were at war, this convention of the people was to act upon the introduction of such foreign troops in the same manner as they would act in case of an invasion by those who were at war with us—What is the construction that follows upon that
ATTORNEYGENERAL 432 Gentlemen, are the parties tu this convention in Scotland such men, as would think of bringing themselves together to declare their sittings permanent upon such a gout as they state here, namely, the legislature of a great country acting in the execution of the great duties which belong to the legislature of that country, without supposing, by that solemn declaration, that they could make their meeting effectual by the acts which were to be carried on for the purpose of preventing that legislature from deliberating upon such duties? By what acts could it be done but by exertions, as they style them, in the manner of their forefathers, by force? By affiliated societies, exerting their physical strength that physical exertion, which Mr. Barlow observes is to be preceded or presided by spreading useful knowledge, and that useful knowledge, being that which is to beat down the existing authority of King, Lords, and Commons. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 433 “ The convention therefore resolve, that each delegate immediately on his return home do convene his constituents, and explain to them the necessity of electing a delegate or delegates, and of establishing a fund without delay, against any of these emergencies, for his or their expense, and that they do instruct the said delegate or delegates to hold themselves ready. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 434 Gentlemen, you see what they expected from the legislature—they knew that what they were doing ought to provoke the legisTature to do what they meant to forbid the legislature to do: and they instruct their delegate or delegates to hold themselves read: —“ to depart at one hour’s warning. Well ight Mr. Skirving say, that a month's delay, ged ile whole was lost : well might Mr. Hardy say, sie he ort in lettersabel produce presently, that i opportunity is lost now, it is lost for ever—we must act now, or we never can. Having some reason to suppose that this convention would be dispersed, they then with great solemnity come to another resolution : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 435 “ That the moment of any illegal dispersion of the British Convention shall be considered as a summons to the delegates to repair to the place of meeting appointed for the convention of emergency hy the Secret Committee, and that the Secret Committee be instructed without delay to proceed to fix the place of meeting. gentlemen, after these resolutions it became necessary to do a little more, that is, to declare upon what principles this conyeniee existed. Now mar ue inciples, and do your country justice; a Laren of the puarseliane tae Thave mate to you, as are worthy your attention, to what I have beture stated as the necessary connexion between the principle and practice of Mr. Paine, and of these societies. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 436 Gentlemen, these principles brought together the French Convention—what is the ractice then, that flows-out of the principle? hy, it is the assembling of a convention upon principles obliging it to sit for the purpose of declaring that the eeilelne shall do nothing but what they liked: that is to all intents and purposes a National Convention ; if not a convention for an eternal reform, at least a convention, that probibits the legislature to do any thing but what is agreeable to them. Then having met for the execution of the practice, they proceed immediately to the declaration of the principle—but they do not proceed to a declaration of the principle, till they have done that strong and solemn act, which I have stated: then they resolve “ that acommittee be appointed to draw up a declaration’—This is France exactly—It is the Southwark Society in 1792—“ a declaration of the natural imprescriptible rights of man, and that the same be prefixed to an address to the people of Great Britain. That a committee of observation, that is, for the better effectuating the purpose that they had before declared, ““be appointed in London to give the earliest intimation of any motion of the kind mentioned in the foregoing resolutions to the different societies. You will then find that they met in a place, which they call Convention Hall, under the wt name of the British Convention, and then they are informed that the London Corresponding Society would undertake tobe that committee of observation, which, they say, ought to exist —and then you will find that the members mentioned that they had thousands of their constituents in London, Sheffield, Norwich, eds, &c. and that the convention was to look at itself as in its true nature a Committee of the people—that therefore it was necessary to have, as they have in France Primary Societies, who shall be consulted—in other words, that this committee of the pores Edinburgh, which was to overrule the ogi lature, was itself to be overruled by these Primary Societies, these primary societies themselves being overruled by the leaders of the great clubs, from which they emanated, and so forming in this country a government, under the power of a Jacobin Club, and that ereounen destroying the present existing legislature of the kingdom. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 437 You will also find that, before these persons parted, Mr. Margarot communicated to his constituents the proceedings of this body, which he styles always the Convention of t People associated to obtain annual parliaments and universal suffrage. There are letters which I shall lay before you, without detailing them, stating that they looked up to the London Corresponding Society, and the Society for Constitutional Information— that their active exertions were necessary for the accomplishing the projects, which the: sitting in Edinburgh were to execute; aad then the two delegates of the London Corresponding Society write to Mr. Hardy, as the secretary of that society, an account of their proceedings—they give him an account of that solemn motion, and of the manner of making it, which I have just been detailing to you—they state to him that they had determined to assemble in convention in any such case— that the appointment of the place, which is a circumstance I beg your most serious attention to, was left to a Secret Committee; but then they send to him an account of the motion, infurming him in the letter—that “letters convey but very imperfectly, and with no great degree of safety, what we might wish to inform each other of. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 438 Now what do you think it is that they do not inform him of in this letter
ATTORNEYGENERAL 440 This Secret Committee having been apinted in the Scotch Convention, the fact ing communicated to the London Corresponding Society by their delegates, you willlikewise find that Mr. Sinclair, the delegate from the Constitutional Society to the Society at Edinburgh, was not behindhand in the communication of it: he communicates the proceedings, and desires that a secret committee may be appointed in that society. It was not long after this, that the wisely exerted power of the magistracy of that country dispersed that convention. The dispersion of that convention, which, from what I have before stated to you, was conceived to bea body that must then do its work, or its work never would be done, suggested to the societies of this country the necessity of undering the same business, of undertaking it at the same hazard, knowing that the project must either then be accomplished, or that it never could thereafter be attempted—for that no government could permit such a convention as this to meet, when its nature was teally understood, without taking some means to protect itself against the consequences of the existence of such a convention. Gentlemen, you will therefore find, that, after they had been dispersed, and aftcr, in consequence of that dispersion, some of them had been punished in Scotland, by sentences which were pronounced upon offences, not stated in the records of that court in so aggravated a way against them as they might, in my humble opinion, have been stated, that it became ni that some step should be taken immediately to prevent the mischief ich was meditated; for you will find, in the evidence, propositions in these societies about a rescue, which failed; but Pe: will find in their correspondence from Scotland, and their correspondence from those ships in which the members of the Scotch Convention were before they sailed in execution of their sentences, not only the strongest invitations to do some strong acts in this country, to both societies, but, on the other hand, the strongest and most unequivocal declarations pee societies, that these strong acts must ne. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 441 Gentlemen, you will find that before they left Scotland, upon the 11th of December, 1793, there is a letter from Mr. Margarot to Mr. Hardy to this effect—“ We received your letter and remittance yesterday, and shall be glad to receive another such without delay. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 442 “ The convention you will see has declared Nself permanent; they are to sit jn some other part of the country, which is not yet 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 443 Gentlemen, Mr. Sinclair, the delegate of the Constitutional Society, came to London. Ihave before observed to you, from a letter of Gerrald and Margarot, that there were some things that could not safely be conveyed by letter. Margarot writes a letter from Edinburgh to the ‘prisoner, in which he says —“ My colleague, Gerrald, also proposes to leave place the latter end of this, or the beginning of the next week: he will expleia himself to you: Pray send him ‘money for this journey, &c. He is now gone to Perth on very urgent business. Since Sinclair's departure nothing new has occurred, except the formation of a society somewhere about the Grampian Hills’—this shows the spirit of fraternization—“ they have already made a subscription towards it: again we are interrupted, and likely tu lose the post, unless I dispatch this immediately. ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 444 Upon the 22d of December 1793, another letter is written to Mr. Hardy by the same gentleman, which probably led in some degree, to the transactions that I have to state as having passed in January 1794; for, after stating what had happened to himself ip Scotland, he says— Sheffield has on this occasion exhibited a most manly spirit’ — The Sheffield Society had at that time sent out some excessively strong resolutions, which I shall give you in evidence in. the course of this business—“ I am extremely mortified to find so great a difference between them and the London Corresponding Society ; itis not however too late. For God's make send forth some very strong resolutions, and above all, talk of impeachments, and of petitioning the king to remove from their offices those persons who have thus violated the laws of the realm. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 445 You will find from a letter of the 24th of December, that spp ales a delegate of the London Society, a delegate of Norwich, and a Mr. Brown, who was the delegate from Sheffield, had gone to attend a general meeting of the Society of the Friends of Freedom in'East Lothian, and then the expression isThe time is come that we must show ourselves worthy of liberty, or deservedly lose it. The opposition of our adversaries is demonstration of the propriety and efficacy of the means which we have employed to obtain it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 446 Upon the 27th of December 1793, a will find Mr. Margarot states that Mr. Gerrald was gone to Perth; that he himself had been in t Lothian ; that they had been well employed; that they must send out spirited resolutions; and you will find, that, upon the 11th of January 1794, Mr. Hardy writes a letter to Norwich relative to the proceedings I have now been stating, the Constitutional Society first, and the London Corresponding Society afterwards, peving in their public acts approved every thing that this convention had done. Mr. Hardy’s letter runs thus: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 447 I have just received a letter from citizen Margarot, at Edinburgh, with some of the Edinburgh Gazetteers, where you will see that citizen Skirving is found guilty, and sentenced for fourteen years transportation to Botany Bay. Margarot’s trial comes next; he meets it with great firmness and resolution. I have no time to make m comments on the proceedings, but I thi our opponents are cutting their. own throats 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 448 ‘| as fast as they can—Now is the time for us to do something worthy of men: the brave deSenders of liberty, south of the English channel, are performing wonders, driving their enemies before them like chaff before the whirlwind. Margarot tells me that he has not time to write to you just now, but he hopes to have time very soon, when his trial is over, and immured in a prison. The London Corres‘ponding Society is to have a general meeting, and an anniversary dinner on Monday the 20th instant, at the Globe tavern, Strand. Gentlemen, you will find that Mr. Margarot, this delegate, with whom Mr. Hardy is thus in correspondence, writes to the Norwich United Societies—“ This morning ten ships of war have left Spithead for the channel; and it is here reported, that the Brest fleet is out. Rumour, always magnifying things, says there are seventy sail of the French at sea; if so, there must be a number of transports among them, and a descent may probably be the consequence—for God's whe: my worthy friends, do not relax in the cause of freedom.—Now what connexion had a descent with the cause of freedom
ATTORNEYGENERAL 450 ‘the proceedings of the year 1794, as far as ithey depend upon written evidence; and it must be a satisfaction to the mind of every man who hears me, that, in the course of this business, whatever observations may arise upon the parol eyidence that will be 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 451 “given you, I think ‘you will find so strong a confirmation of all you are to hear in the written evidence that is to be laid before you, ‘that these observations cannot possibly mislead you from coming to the true conclusion upon the whole of the evidence, whatever that may be. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 452 Gentlemen,. the Constitutional Society, having sent their delegate to the Scotch Con‘vention, you will find that, ata meeting of “the 17th of January 1794, the following reso‘lutions were come to, to which I must desire your particular attention, more especially as there are some circumstances belonging to the composition of those resolutions, which appear to me to be worthy of attention. I have before told you that these resolutions “were usually drawn from minutes—the original minutes still exist, and perhaps they show that discretion, with which men are sometimes able to state, in different ways, precisely the same thing: I say, that these Tesolutions of the 17th of January 1794, were meant to excite the subjects of this country to resistance. co 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 453 “ Resolved, That law ceases to be an object of obedience, whenever it becomes an instrument of oppression. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 454 “ Resolved, That we recall to mind, with the infamous Jefferies, once lord chief justice of England, who, at the era of the glorious revolution, for the many iniquitous sentences which he had passed, was torn to pieces by a brave and injured people. This 1s applied to the judges of Scotland, who executed the law upon such facts as I have been stating —“ That those who imitate his example deserve his fate—this sort of intimation might have a tendency, I hope it had not, to put in any peril those who did, in the regular course, and in the due course, of their judicial duties, pass those sentences, to which these resolutions allude. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 455 “ That the Tweed, though it may divide countries, ought not, and does not, make a separation between those principles of com‘mon severity in which Englishmen and Scotchmen are equally interested; that injustice in Scotland is-injustice in England; and that the safety of Englishmen is endangered, whenever their brethren in Scotland, for a conduct ‘which entitles them to the approbation ofall wise, and the support of all brave men, are sentenced to Botany Bay, a punishment hitherto intlicted only on felons. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 456 hat we see with regret, but we see without fear, that the period is fast approacliing when the liberties of Britons—this was in January—“ must depend, not upon reason, to which they have long appealed, nor on their powers of expressing it, but on theirfirm and undaunted resolution to ‘oppose tyranny by the same means by which it is exercised. Now what is thetyranny? The exercise of the regular government of the country. What is the means by which it is exercised? The application of the force of the country in support of the government of the country. What is this resolution then? Why, that the means which the government takes in the regular exercise of its functions, ought now to be resisted— We see it with regret, but do not see it with any fear. That a breach of allegiance was contemplated you can have no doubt, for you will see in the original of this that it stood thusthat, “ as allegiance and protection are reciprocal, law ccuses to be an object of obedience, wherever it becomes an instrument of eppressian Cae that, as it stood originally, with the third resolution, and whatait? Why, it is—that the protection, which was due from Kim to whom allegiance is due, has not been afforded: therefore allegiance is no longer due. “ We see with regret, but we see without fear, that the period is fast approaching, when the liberties of Britons must depend, not upon reason, to which they have long appealed, nor on their powers of expresing it, but on-their firm ard undaunted resolution to oppose tyranny by the same means by which it is exercised. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 457 You will also find that it stood, “that lishmen feel the oppression of Scotehmen, which they are determined to resist at the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 458 ‘fhe deepest satisfaction, the merited fate ofhazard of their lives,"—You will find the lass resolution, in the minates, comparing the gebuine representatives of this country, in the House of Commons, with this convention in Scotland, which convention in Scotland had taken upon itself to resolve upon resistance to even a motion, in either House of Parliament of this country, in the execution of their duty, thus : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 459 hat we approve of the conduct of the British Convention, who, though assailed by force, have not been answered by arguments, and who, unlike the members of a certain assembly, have no interest distinct from the common body of the peuple—The words originally e008 who “ being the incorrupt representatives of many thousands, have spoken thege of truth and firmness. Can I make this court the instrument of conveying to the public, what I cenfess I do most anxiously wish to make it the instrument of conveying to the public, as far as it is fit, in the execution of the duty that I am now discharging, that they may understand what it is that men, when they are scattering these libels through the country, mean—“ this convention, assailed by force, have not been answered by arguments—How was it possible to answer those by arguments, who were comting to solemn and sacred resolutions, which they did not even dare to put upon the face of their own minutes? How were we to answer those by ment, who were working under ground till they had blown up the government, and then say, you cannot point out that we have been acting ill, because we will not tell you how we have been acting ? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 460 Upon the 16th, Mr. Margarot writes again, leaving them to pursue what sort of conduct they please. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 461 Then there is a letter of some importance of the 28th of January, which is written to the person who stands at the bar—“ We have justreceived notice from the sheriff to hold ourselves nenly We depart at an hour's warning: we night; we imagine to Newgate; Look out for us. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 462 Gentlemen, you will likewise find a letter from Mr. Margarot to Mr. Hardy, of great consequence, as it explains many of the passages im the evidence between the 20th of January 1704, and the time that those persons were apprehended. Margarot writes from Edinburgh in this manner : “ armed associations are, I ewe, now set on foot by the rich; wherefore should not the poor do the same? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 463 “ Are you to wait patiently till twenty thousand Hessians and Hanoverians come to cut your throats? And will you stretch forth your necks like lambs to the butcher’s knife, and, like lambs, content yourselves with bleating? Pray let me hear from you soon. Remember me to Moffat, Muir, and Palmer, and all suffering brethren. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 464 Gentlemen, upon the 20th of January 1794, there was a meeting at the Globe tavern; that meeting, which, you will permit me to observe, Hardy mentioned in his letter of the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 465 11th of January 1794, which I before have spoken of, when he said the London Corresponding Society were to have a general meeting, and an anniversary dinner. Gentlemen, the proceedings of that day will des serve your very particular attention. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 466 “ Ata general meeting of the London Cor. responding Society, held at the Globe tavern, Strand, on Monday the 20th day of January 1794, citizen John Martin in the chair,— when I state this to you, I ought to say that I shall prove the prisoner to have been present, or to have been connected with all the transactions that I have been stating—“ the following address to the people of Great Britain and Ireland, was read and agreed to : citizens, We find the nation involved in a war, by which, in the course of one campaign, immense numbers of our countrymen have been slaughtered ; a vast expense has been incurred; our trade, commerce, and manufactories are almost destroyed ; and many of our ma nufacturers and artists are ruined, and their families starving. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 467 o add to our affliction, we have reason to expect that other taxes will soon be adied to the intolerable load of imposts and impositions, with which we are already overwhelm ed, for the purpose of defraying the expenses which have been incurred in a fruitless cresade, to re-establish the odious despotism of France. Co 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 468 “ When we contemplate the principles of this war, we confess ourselves to be unable to approve of it as a measure either of justice or discretion; and, if we are to form our calcu lation of the result, from what has already passed, we can only look forward to defeat, and the eternal disgrace of the British name. While we are thus engaged in an expen sive and ruinous foreign war, our state at home is not less deplorable. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 469  We are every day told by those persone who are interested in aap ns the corruption list, and an innumerable host of sinecure placemen, that the constitution of England is the perfection of human wisdom; that our laws (we should rather say their laws) are the perfection of justice; and that their administration of those laws is so impartial and so Teady, a3 to afford an equal remedy both to the rich and to the poor, by means of which we are said to be placed in a state of absolute freedom. The paper then goes on and reasons upon the state of the law in this country, under an exposition of Magna Charta, which gives as nearly the true meaning of it as man would give, who had never seen it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 470 “Jf we look to Ireland, we find that aeknowledged privilege of the people to mect for the support and protection of their rights and liberties, is attempted by terror to be taken away, by a late mfamous act of parliament
ATTORNEYGENERAL 472 “In Scotland, the wicked hand of power has been impudently exerted without even the wretched formality of an act of parliament
ATTORNEYGENERAL 474 “ The wisdonr and good conduct of the British Convention in Edinburgh has been such, as to defy their bitterest enemies to name the law which they bave broken; notwithstanding which, their papers have been seized and made use of as evidence against them, and many virtuous and meritorious individuals have been, as cruelly as unjustly, for their virtuous actions, disgraced and destroyed by infamous and illegal sentences of transportation; and these unjust and wicked judgments have been-executed with a rancour -and malignity never before known in this land; our respectable and beloved fellow Citizens have been cast fettered into dungeons, amongst felons in the hulks, to which they were not sentenced. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 475 “Citizens, we all approve the sentiments, ‘and are daily repeating the words for which these our respectable and valuable brethren are thus, unjustly and inhumanly, suffering ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 476 we do associate—mark the expression—“ in order to obtain a fair, free, and full representation of the people in a house of real national representatives
ATTORNEYGENERAL 478 ‘with societies in England; and that, in that state of affiliation and association, holding a convention, as they call it, of the people, from delegates of these societies, and not el the people—to do what 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 480 Gentlemen, recollect the expressions that Tread to yeu from Skirving’s letter: “ will you wait till barracks are erected in every village, and till subsidized Hessians and Hanoverians are upon us? You will now see from the proceedings I am stating to you, that the time was come, that they were not only virtuous but courageous enough to do an act, which in 1792 and 1793, though they were virtuous enough to do, they were not cow rageous enough to do. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 481 “ You may ask. perhaps, by what means shall we seek redress? We answer, that men in a state of civilized society, are bound to seek redress of the grievances from the laws, as long as any redress can be obtained by the laws; but our common master, whom we serve (whose law is a law of liberty, and whose service is perfect freedom), has taught us not to expect to gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles: we must have redress Jrom our own laws. —Were they to be a convention of the people, then, without making laws? They approve the whole conduct of the British Convention, that would not let others make laws, and yet were they not to make laws? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 482 “ We must have redress from our own laws, and not from other laws; the laws of Great Britain are thus described,—“ the laws of our plunderers, enemies, and oppressors : indeed, if the legislature of their country were their plunderers, enemies, and oppressors, in their Notions, it would be very difficult to suppose, that they were to have redress from the laws of that legislature; but then it follo of course, that they meant to have reiress Ronn laws made by some other body, that had authority to make laws: and what that other bodyis, but the Convention which they determine upon must be left for those to say, who can find it out. They go on then to say, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 483 ‘“ There is no redress for a nation circumstanced as we are, but in a fair, free, and ful representation of the people
ATTORNEYGENERAL 485 Then follows a resolution that will require likewise your very particular attention : “ Resolved, That during the ensuing session of parliament the general committee of this society do meet daily, for the purpose of watching the proceedings of the parliament and of the administration of the government of this country. This was to be published: they do not therefore venture to insert totidem verbis that resolution, which I have stated to you was so solemnly made, and so sacredly sworn to in the Scotch Convention, but they resolve “ that upon the first introduction of any bill or motion inimical to the liberties of the peole, such as for landing foreign troops in Great ritain or Ireland, for suspending the Habeas Corpus act, for proclaiming martial law, or for preventing the people from meeting in societies for constitutional information — What the meaning of the term constitutional is we can judge by this time—that uponany express motion of this nature, “or any other innovation o «a similar nature ; that on any of these emergencies the general committee shall issue summonses to the delegates of each division, and also to the secretaries of the different societies affiliated and corresponding with-this society, forthwith to calla eae caecalin of the people, to be held at such place, and in such a manner, as shall be specified in the sammons, for the purpose of taking such measures into their consideration. They omit the case of invasion in this publication. But what is this, supposing nothing had passed in Scotland of what I have stated to you? What! Is the legislature, is the rule and government in this great country reduced to this state, that it shall ind no protection in the administration of the law of the country against ns, associating and affiliating themselves x the purposes which they declare here? Is no motion to be made in parliament for amy purpose, which these societies choose to comprehend under the terms “ any other innevation, without explaining what it means
ATTORNEYGENERAL 487 Now, do they canvene the-people? In faet, it will be said, nothing like it. t they cali themselves a convention of the people in the very terms that they use. the summonses are to go to the delegates of each meeting, and also the secretaries of the different societies corresponding with this society, and no where else. For what purpose? ‘To call a general convention of the people! Then, what w the meaning of all that, taking it with its context? It is thise from your laws—the laws of you, our plunderers, enemies, and oppressors—we can expect no relief: we do not mean to come to you fur any: but we will watch you, and if you dare to propose an innovation of any sort, we shall call a fain, Sree, and full representation of the people. Composed pray how? By delegates from our societies, to seek, as a general convention of the People, redress from our own laws. It appears to me that the reasoning upon this paper 1s so whole and intire, that it is out of power of human ingenuity to touch it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 488 Then they resolve, “ That a hundred thousand copies of the Address to the people of Great Britain and Ireland shall be printed. Then they follow this up with the publication of a great many toasts ; and really, when one mentions such a thing as toasts in the trial of a greatnational cause, such as this undoubtedly is, one is afraid of its sinking into insignificance ; and yet this is a great feature in this cause. You will find that previously to one ofthe most seditious meetings which was ever held in this country, it was thought of importance enough that they should meet once, twice, or thrice, in committees, in arder to frame toasts, which were best calculated to inflame their minds, and to urge those forward who were already engaged in these projects, “ The Rights of Man: “ The British Convention ;—“ Success to the arms of freedom, against whomsoever directed. This is during the war—against whom were the armsof freedom directed, in the opinion of these persons? You remember they said that “ the elector of Hanover may join his troops to traitors and robbers; but the king of Great Britain will do well to remember that this country is not. Hanover: should he forget the distinction, we will not. They corresponded with the French in October; and in November 1792, they state to you, that the principles of their resolutions are those upon which they meant to act—that Great Britain was now engaged in a war—which they mmned—in which the arms of freedom, as ghey said, had never been engaged on the part of Great Britain. Then the meaning of the toast is obvieus, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 489 Another toast was—“ The virtuous and spirited citizens now in confinement for matters of opinion. Now, these matters of opinion are acts all done in the long tissue and detail of aconspiracy to subvert the monarchical government of this country, under its present legal provisions and limitations. The name of Mr. Frost being mentioned— I'mean him no disrespect in saying this—but it is tothe purpose of this business to take Notice of it—that gentleman was prosecuted in this country for this doctrine—“ No king, none in England, I am for liberty and equality every where. What was the consequence of that? The judgment of the law of England upon him was, that he was guilty of an offence: he was punished: he has suffered that punishment, and made an atonement to the Jaw: but these gentlemen, who sent Mr. Frost with Mr. Barlow, to state such doctrine to France, and br:ng such doctrine baek from France, you will find that they havea formal resolution that they will sustain this Mr. Frost in all his persecutions and prosecutions. Docs that mean nothing? If Mr. Frost is perseeuted for holding doctrines in the country, which were to put the king out of the system, is it no evidence of intention with respect to those who engaged in such projects jas I have mentioned, that they do come to a resolution, in which they declare that the law, questioning the propriety of declarations of that kind amounts toa persecution, and that he ought to be sustained against it? Gentlemen, you will bear from witnesses, who were present, what the proceedings on the 20th of January, and the general com’ plexion and nature of them were. Mr. Martin being in the chair, and Mr. Hardy being present, who wasa member of both these societies, an attending member in both of them, I will give you Martin’s account of the proceeding on the 22d of January 1794, in a letter in bis own hand-writing, sent to MauTice Margarot, at Edinburgh, who bad advised you will recollect, the London Corresponding Society to come to sume strong resolutions— who had urged that now is the time, that two months in Scotland would do the business, provided they did their duty in England. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 490 “ My dear sir, I dare say you think I have forgot you from my not having written to You, but you know my sentiments so well that it ‘was unnecessary for me, and would probably have been improper to say much on the subject of your mission’—then he states something about private business. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 491 “We had a meeting on Monday, I was in the chair—the newspaper gives our numbers at 500, but we were nearer 1,500: every thing was well conducted, that is to say regularly, and the proceedings were tolerably bold. Mr. Hardy, dare say, has sent you a copy of the address and resolution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 492 “ Your conduct receives universal approbation; and though I at one time dreaded the who opposed the subscription at first, are now putting their hands to the very bottom of their pockets, and swear by God you shall be supported with the last guinea—we must have another general meeting in a chapel, or some large place, and declare the purpose of a subscription, and I think we shall get plenty of the needful:for that and other purposes. Have you read my letter to ? do you incline to try the writ of error? what do the Scotch lawyers think of it, and what do you think of the legal knowledge of my countrymen? I firmly believe that the law is the only science, of which they know nothing. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 493 he king went yesterday to meet Ais parliament’—so now we have got no parliament of ours, the people of this country —“ they sat till six o’clock this morning: the papers are not out, but I am told only twelve members were for peace: I am glad the minister has so great a majority within doors for the war, and that the people have a greater majority without doors against the war: the swinish rogues had the impudence to write ‘ No war’ on all the doors and corners of the Houses of Lords and Commons, and they had even the audacity to groan and hiss, while his most sacred majesty was passing to and from the House —nay told, a woman, moved and seduced by the instigation of the devil, and traitorously intending, &c. did in St. James's Park take off her patten, and threw it with all her force at his majesty, whereby the glass of the state coach was broken, and his majesty putin fear: God save the king, for if, &c
ATTORNEYGENERAL 495 “ The society is increasing rapidly, both in spirit and in numbers, and the richnow begin to come among us, and to sit down with pleasure among the honest men with the leathern aprons. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 496 I could write to you strange things, but I know not but this may be read by somebody before it comes to your hands. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 497 Gentlemen, after this had passed, you will find that that letter was written by the Corresponding Society to the Society tor Constie tutional Informatiton (which I first mentioned to you) upon the 27th of March 1794, and now with your leave, I will read a part of .it to you again. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 498 “ I am directed by the London Correspond ing Socicty to transmit the following resolutions to the society for Constitutional Information. I should tell you first, in the order of time, that the society for Constitutional Information distinctly adopt that paper of the London Corresponding Society of the 20th of January 1794, as their own, and order it to be entered upon their books; they approve of the manly sentiments of it, and they fully take it to themselves, to all intents and purposes, as if it had been a conjunct meeting of them both. Then, the London Corresponding Society having held this- language respecting the convention, and upon the 24th of J. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 499 want of money, yet that is now over: those, the Constitutional Society having adopted the project of a convention stated in the address of the London Corresponding Society of the 20th, and the nature of that convention being acopvention from the atftiliated societies, to take upon themselves the character of a conpention of the people, it would be surprising indeed ifthe convention, which they speak of on the 27th of March, should be a convention of a different nature from that which they had both agreed to on the 20th and 24th of January—and with that observation I come again to this letter of the 27th of March. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 500 am directed by the London Corresponding Society to transmit the following resolutione tu the Society for Constitutional Information, and to request the sentiments of that society respecting the important measures which the present juncture of affairs seems to require. ‘The London Corresponding Society eonceives that the moment is arrived throughout the years 1791, 1792, and 1793, they thought it was not arrived—“ when a full and explicitdeclaration is necessary from all the friends of treedom—whether the late illegal and unheard-of prosecutions and sentences shall determine us to abandon our cause, or shall excite us to pursue a radical reform, with an ardour proportioned to the magnitude of the object, and with a zeal as distinguished on our parts, as the treachery of others in the same glorivus cause is notorious. The society for Constitutional Information is therefore required to determine whether or no they will be ready, when called upon, to act in conjunction with this and other societies, to obtain a tair representation of the people, whether they concur with us in seeing the necessity of a speedy convention for the purpose of obtaining, in a constitutional and legal method, a redress of those grievances under which we at present labour. Now, in the first place, with respect to the words “constitutional and legal method, ‘these persons have not much to claim upon the score of the effect and force of the words constitutional and legal method, which appear, through all their transactions of the years 1792 and 1793, and more particularly through the transactions of 1793, as they appy to the British Convention, in Scotland, to thought consistent with the existence of a eonvention of such a character as that had; and, if it was their purpose to have a convention of the people, by summonses to affiliated societies, that convention to take upon itself the power of the people, it is in vain that they talk of legal and constitutional methods : it is in vain, if the thing they mean to do, and the manner of doing it, is not legal or constitutional —Upon this letter, I apprehend, after what has passed, there can be no doubt what is meant bya convention: but it is not left there: for in the third resolution they state, that “there ought to be immediately 4 convention of the people by delegates—mark the words—“ deputed for that purpose from the aifferent societies of the friends of freedom, assembled in the various parts of this nation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 501 Then here is a convention of the same character, of the same name, and the same constitution, as that mentioned in the resolution of the 20th of January 1794. Now, to whom is this proposed? It is proposed to that Constitutional Society, which had adopted the address of the 20th of January 1794, and which had also said, by approving that address, that they were of opinion that redress was not to be obtained by the laws of England, but that they were to have redress against their oppressors, plunderers, and enemies, by their own laws—by that sort of representation of the people, which is formed by aconvention of the people, summoned from those associated societies. Then what follows upon it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 503 Gentlemen, when I lay this evidence before you, if I stopped here, I should be glad to learn why this is not a step taken for the execution of such a purpose as I have before stated—a step taken for constituting a body, or a step taken towards devising the means of constituting a body which was, lke the convention mentioned in the speech of Barrere, to supersede the legislature, to depose the king, to suffer him to have no existence, but what their good will and pleasure would allow him, against the will, as the language of the indictment states it, and im defiance of the authority of the parliament—to depose the king—for, if these people have the sovereign power, and they must have the sovereign power upon their own principles—the king of England cannot have it in the manner in which it is vested in him now. He was bound to resist such a projectas this: he owed it to every good subject in his country to resist it— he was sworn to do it by the solemn obligation of his coronation oath—you cannot therefore contemplate a case of his acting otherwise—the king being bound to resistance for the security of the subject, and fur the sake of observing his oath, for the sake of continuing to reign according to the terms of that oath, according to the statutes acreed upon in parliament assembled, and the laws and customs of the same. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 504 But, gentlemen, I do not stop here: you will also that there was a mecting at 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 505 Chalk Farm, the particulars of which I will Not state farther than to say, that, when they arg read, you will see that that meeting at Chalk Farm was a step taken in the farther prosecution of the functions of that committee of co-operation—that it was a measure taken for the express purpose of trying the temper of the people, of seeing what they could do by numbers. That meeting was held in April 1794, and it is very remarkable that it appears that there were meetings in other parts of this kingdom ; more particularly it appears from a letter, found in the possession of this prisoner, baa a there was a meeting in the open air at Chalk Farm, so there were meetings elsewhere —it required vigilance—it required the interposition of some strong hand, by parliament or otherwise, to preserve you in the situation in which you now are: if it be the will of these persons that you shall not remain in it, it is at least the duty of those, who are to watch over the country as long as it can exist, that it shall not be destroyed by any fault of theirs: but you will find there were meetings in the open air at Leeds, Wakefield, Huddersfield, Bradford, Birstal, and at various other laces. This project of a convention had en communicated to many parts of the country, and too many of them had assented to it; not only assented to it, but it will be proved, that the prisoner sent a circular letter to the remotest parts of this kingdom (which I willnow read), for the purpose of assembling this convention, for the perpore of carrying into effect the project of this British Convention, the body of which had been dissipated, but which was still carrying on its purposes b measures precisely the same as those whic! had exist in this part of the island. You will find that the prisoner writes this circular letter to all those societies; and the addressing this circular letter to all the societies, shows that the convention that was to be called was not to be a convention of the people at large, but a convention of delegates summoned from those societies, to usurp the character of “ a convention of the people. — “ The critical moment is arrived—mark the difference of language; in 1793 the time is not yet come, men are not virtuous nor courageous enough ; in 1792 they expected nothing from parliament; in 1793, they expected every thing from the societies in due time; and now they assert that the due time is come, that the Sulness of time is come—“ the critical moment “6 arrived, and Britons must either assert with zeal and firmness their claims to liberty, ‘or yield without resistance to the chains that ministerial usurpation is forging for them. Will you co-operate with us in the only peaceable measure—a very peaceable measure a convention of this sort!—“ that now presents itself with any prospect of success? We need not intimate to you, that, notwithstanding the unparalleled audacity of a corrupt and overbearing faction—now this corrupt and overbearing faction is the King, Lords, and Gommons of Great Britain—“ which at present earnest on the rights and liberties of the people; our peeing cannot in England be interrupted without the previous adoption of a convention bill. A convention bill !—this shows the reason for their resolutions in Scotland about permanent sittings, and the meeting of another British Convention, and for their language, which they held upon the. 20th of January 1794; “a measure it is our duty to anticipate’—mark these words—“ our duty to anticipate, that the ties of union may be more firmly drawn, and the sentiments and views of the different societies throughout the nation be com "—What was their object in this circular letter? If, when the British Convention in Edinburgh sat, there had been a motion for a convention bill in the parliament of Great Britain, why, their object was then, we perceive, that of being ready at an hour’s warning; communicating in ali parts of the kingdom to their delegates that solemn resolution, which had been made im the British Convention upon the 6th of November; they were instantly, before the project of such a bill could in parliament ripen out of notice of a motion into a bill once read, to be assembled in Edinburgh to prevent any such bill passing; they solemnl vowed to each other, hand in hand, and stan ing up, to give the greater solemnity to the declaration, “ that the moment such a bill as that was introduced into parliament, they would resist it at the hazard of their lives. Then what did they mean in this circular letter ? they meant that, while as yet the bare expectation of a convention bill might exist, while, as yet, no notice of such a motion was given or heard of in parliament—that it was their duty to anticipate what parliament might possibly think of. How to anticipate it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 507 The loprothaetion of sick men e this eountry for the humane purpose of giving them that air, which they could not obtain while on board a ship, is made the pretext of this letter for stating that “Hessians and Austrians are already among us, and, if we tamely submit, a cloud of these armed barbarians may be pace inupon us. Let us form then another British Convention. What was that convention? they expressly state it to be convention of the people, and a convention, which is to assume controlling powers over the legislature. “‘ We have a central situation io our view, which we believe would be most convenient for the whole island, but which we forbear to mention (entreating your confidence in this particular) till we have the answer of—whom 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 509 Gentlemen, this will be proved to you to have travelled as far as Strathaven, to have been received there, and delegates to have been appointed in consequence of the solicitation ; and then, as in the British Convention, in the month of November 1793, this great project of calling together a body, which was to put an end finally to the existence of parliament, was to be conducted by a secret committee ; because its operations, its assembling, and the means which were to be taken for it, could not be committed to numbers, a secret committee was then appointed. This letter ends—“ for the management of this business we have sppomnied a secret committee: you will judge how far it is necessary for you to do thesame. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 510 Gentlemen, the next proceedings were at Chaik Farm. In these proceedings, it appears, they had stated to the Society called “ the Friends of the People, this measure of a convention ; that measure the Friends of the People refused to agree in. You will find that, refusing to agree in that measure, at the meeting at Chalk Farm, when it was stated that the Society of the Friends of the People would not agree in it—indeed, agree in it they could not—you will find what was the reception, which the communication of that information met with—an universal from a body of men, amounting, I believe, to a couple of thousand there assembled. entlemen, this committee of correspondence and co-operation, you will find, met; you will find that there is in the hand-writing of the prisoner, in avery short note, an account of what was done when they met; that one of the first steps towards the accomplishment of their purposes, was a communication of the correspondences of the country societies to those who were to be the delegates of the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 511 Constitutional Society; but the meeting was’ broke up by the apprehension of the prisoner and others, which has led, as I before stated, to this prosccution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 512 Gentlemen, I have before told you that I conceived it was competent for me, as indeed 1 apprehend without question it is, after proving the conspiracy, to show the conduct of the persons, who were parties in that conspiracy, in furtherance of the conspiracy, when it is proved. You will find that one of the persons who attended the meeting of the 20th of January 1794, and who was a very active member of the London Corresponding Society, and likewise one of the committee of correspondence and co-operation, which J have alluded to as the final act of this business, gives himself this account of the transactions of the 20th of January 1794, and of other circumstances: this is Mr. Thelwall. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 513 “ It is with infinite satisfaction that at last I received a letter from you; it was brought this morning by citizen Lee, and has been delayed, I understand, this fortnight at Rotherhithe by some accident. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 514  am too well acquainted with mankind to be surprised, too much of a philosopher to be angry at the abuse and misrepresentation of mistaken men; but I shall endeavour, as I wish to preserve the good opinion of a man whom I remember with esteem, to send you such printed documents as will prove to you that, instead of having deserted the cause of liberty, I have redoubled my zeal, and thas there is not at this time in England a man that goes bolder lengths, and exposes himself to more danger, in the cause of liberty, tham myself. I have been for four or five months past almost the sole labourer upon whom the fatigue, the danger, and the exertions of the London Corresponding Societies, the only avowed Sans Culottes in the metropolis, have rested; and have been otherwise so active in the cause, as scarcely to have passed a week without threats and conspiracies from the government and its purblind adherents. Ever since the famous, or infamous, call it which you will, proclamation of November, 1792, I have been frequenting all public Meetings where any thing could be done or expected, have been urging and stimulatin high and lew, and endeavouring to rally an encourage the friends of freedom. I have been constantly sacrificing interest and security, offending every personal advantageous connexion, till ministerialists, oppositionists, and moderees, hate me with equal cordiality, and, if I may judge by their conduct, fear me as much as they hate.. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 515 “ For these four months, I have been giving political lectures and gr and appropriating the whole receipts, till the last fortnight, to the support of our delegates to the British “ Convention ; for the history of which I must refer you to citizen Talbot, whom I have not seen tat whom I hope to see before he leaves England. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 516 e then gives an account of the meetings T have been stating to you, and of his lectures: then he says, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 517 “ Adieu. I will collect together what political papers ‘I can, to send to you when I can find leisure. Do write to me; let me know something aboat the state of politics and society in America. I fear you are somewhat short of the true Sans Culutte liberty ; that you have too much veneration for property, too much religion, and too much law. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 518  fear you are somewhat short of the true Sans Culotte liberty. Now, that is, that you have too much veneration for property, too meh religion, and too much law. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 519 Gentlemen, having now gone through the written evidence, I am to state to you some other circumstances. I have not indeed stated all the written evidence, because you will have written evidence laid before you of stimulations, under singular pretexts, to these societies, to arm themselves. You will find, that parliament, where they meant hereafter to suffer no debate, about the Hessians and Hanoverians, they circulated among them papers, and it will be brought home to those with respect to whom it is stated, to this effect — The ins tell us we are in danger of insvasion from the French ; the outs tell us that we are in danger from the Hessians and Hanoverians: ineither case, we should arm ourselves. Get arms, and leam how to use shem. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 520 You will likewise find, upon this part of the ease, that, after the dispersion of the Bri‘ish Convention in Edinburgh, after it was teen that the law of this country was strong enough to beat down .a conspiracy of that kind, acting by their mere naked numbers, that it became then, in their opinion, necessary to the accomplishment of their purpose, to act with arms. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 521 Now, gentlemen, where a general conspiracy of this sort, among affiliated societies, existed in Scotland, Sheffield, Norwich, Manchester, smd various parts of the king‘dom, all aiming at the same end, all acting upon the same principle, all involved in the same project of having a convention from the different parts of the united kingdoms, it is natural that they should think of arms: but, if the eonspiracy did not exist, it would seem a very odd thing that it should happen in fact, that, in these different rts of the kin; ‘field, and in London, we should find persons preparing arms of a sort, and of a denomination, which of late years we have not heard of in this country, except as existing in France, and except as stated in a letter from France, which I have read to you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 522 But, gentlemen, Bo will find, from the evidence I have to offer, and indeed it is not lom, in Scotland, in Shef. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 523 snprisips that you should so find—after I shall tell you, that in the pocket of one of the parties in this conspiracy, and distributed also in divisions in the London Corresponding Society, were papers, importing that upon the 1st of April, 1794, was to be periirrmesh, The Guillotine, or George’s Head inBasket ; papers in which the sacred person of the king 1s so spoken of, and in which all orders of men, under ludicrous representations of them to their country, were doomed te lamp-irons, and to suspension ; after I shall tell you, that I am instructed that Mr. Thelwall could, when retiring from Chalk-farm, take a pot of peer in his hand, with a knife take off the ead, and say, “ Thus I would serve all kings ; if you should find such language used, I am persuaded you widl not be surprised to find pikes in the hands of these men and their associates—to find muskets in the hands of these men and their associates. Do not, gentlemen, let us be misled by the great doctrine of the Bill of High that every man has a right to arms for his own protection— he has without question a right to convenient arms for his own defence; but the point before a jury will be, for what purpose had he the arms? If he attempts to say that he had them for his own defence—if had he them in fact for a worse purpose, the attempt to colour the tact makes the fact more criminal. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 524 Gentlemen of the jury, you will find that Mr. Yorke, in the month of November 1793, will be proved to have been at one of the divisions of the London Corresponding Society, stating, that he was going among the sons of liberty into Belgium, to bring into this coun try the true friends of liberty. You will find that he was a member of the Landon Cortespending Society, and constituted a delegate of the Constitutional Soeiety to Scotland ; that he has been propagating at Sheffield the same doctrine, as his brother associates were propagating in London: that he was there directing the form in which pikes should be made, to persons who were to make such instruments; that the persons at Sheffield enter into a correspondence with the prisoner at the bar; that they inform him that these pikes are made; that he delivers the direction to persons of the Corresponding Society, in order that they may furnish themselves with these instruments ; and that they were to be furnished from Sheffield to a place here, I think, the Parrot, ix Green Arbour alley, or some other place in this town; and that, if the apprehension of these persons here, and at Shetheld, had not put an ead to the farther execution of the project, there would have been a large apron of these pikes into this part of the kingdom. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 525 Gentlemen, you will find that this idea of arms was carried farther; you will find that, for the use of this society, a plate with figures, showing the manner of learning the military exercise, was engraved by a Mr. Worship, a member of this society. You will find that there was a military society in Lambeth, and another in Turnstile, Holborn; they were small in their beginnings, I admit; but these things must be so in their beginnings; and you will find, that the prisoner at the bar ve'to a witness of the name of Edwards, a jirection of whom to obtain pikes at Sheffield. Mr. Williams; another witness, who will be called to you, who is a gun-engraver in the Tower, made muskets for the use of these societies in Lambeth, and in Turnstile, with an express protest that he should not be employed, unless he himself became a member of the societies. You will find accordingly that he did become a member of them. You will find that they drilled at particular places. Gentlemen, I give you this outline of this part of the evidence, because I do not wish to enter more into the particulars, than to give you a general impression of the nature of the case which I have to lay before you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 526 You will likewise see, what is natural enough to happen, when you find in the book of the Society for Constitutional Information, that Mr. Horne Tooke could think of giving notice, that he would move “ that two books should be vpened, one of them (bound in black) in which should be entered all the enormities of those who deserve the censure ; and in the other, the merits of those who deserve the gratitude of the society. You will not be surprised, if you should find persons in these affliated societies, of lower descriptions, holding conversations about seizing the Most august persons in the nation; if you should hear of their holding conversations about the situation of persons in the House of Commons, and the means by which they could know their persons. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 527 Upon the whole, gentlemen of the jury, I shall now lay the testimony before you, submitting this written evidence to you, calling witnesses, above all exception, to a great part of the case; calling some witnesses, whom I now avow to you, you will find, were persona employed by government to watch over the proceeslings of these societies, and who there‘ore became informed, in consequence of such employment, of some of their transactions; and government would have been wanting to itself, and would have been wanting to a degree of criminality, which no mancan describe, if this country had at this moment been in the state in which it would have been, if these pikes had been brought into actual exertion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 528 At Sheffield, indeed, I am told they had got to the length of forming iron instruments, which were to disable horse, which they called night-cats, and which would immediately insert themselves into the hoofs of horses feet. I say, if, with these projects going on im the country, a secretary of stute, or any other person in the executive government, had hesitated a moment to procure information, these parties might have been able to put into execution the projects they were mepighng. and he would have been answerable for it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 529 Gentlemen, it-is the great province of a British jury, and God forbid these prisoners should not have the benefit of the reflection, that British juries are able to protect us all— are able to sift the characters of witnesses— to determine what credit is due to them—listening to men of good character without any impression against their evidence—listening to men, such as I have stated, with a strong impression against their evidence ; that impression, however, to be beat down by the concurrent unsuspicious testimony arising out of the rest of the case, if, upon the whole ou shall find the case to be made out as I ave stated it to you1. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 530 Gentlemen, I torgot to mention to you, that you will likewise find, about the time that this convention was talked of, that there was a new constitution framed for the Corresponding Society, in which they speak of a royalist as an enemy to the liberties of his country —of a democrate, as a friend to the liberties of his country; and you will find, that, ina constitution again revised, the whole was thrown into a scheme, and into a system, which was to add physical strength to the purposes of that convention, which was, I submit to you, to assume all civil and political authority. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 531 Tf you find all these things, and, if under the direction of that wisdom that presides here, with respect to which, gentlemen, let me say again, that the situation of this country is indeed reduced to a most miserable one, if the respect, which is due to the administration of the law, is suffered to be weakened in any manner, if the respect, which is due to the administration of the law, that administration, which perhaps is the best feature of the constitution under which we live, is destroyed, miserable indeed must be the situation of your country! If you’ find under that direction that the case, being proved in fact, is also made out in law, you will do that on behalf of the public which is due to yourselves, to the public, to your posterity, and theirs. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 532 But on the other hand, if, after hearing this case fully stated, and attempted to be fully proved, you should be of opinion that it is not proved, or you should be finally of opinion that the offence is not made out ac cording to the Aallowed interpretation of the statute of Edward 3rd; I say then, in the conclusion, I pein. from my heart, in the prayer which the law makes on behalf of the prisoner, God send the prisoner a safe deliverance !

ATTORNEYGENERAL 2802 From whom had you those books
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2835 In the course of our business, did you ever know of any other ok intituled “ An Address to the Addressers ? : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2839 Are you a member of the Constitutional Society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2845 I should like to know how you could prove Locke’s Essay upon Human Understanding otherwise: Is that the book you sold at your shop as an Address to the Addressers, when such a book was asked for
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2847 Look at the matter of the book ? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2852 Suppose the Constitutional Socicty referred to Locke’s Essay upon the Human Understanding, how is it possible to identify that book without callin, the bookseller to prove that that is the boo which he sells for Locke’s Essay on the Human Understanding? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2854 This is what I am asking to. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2856 Is that the boole you would have sold as the Address to the Aderessers, by Thomas Paine? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2858 I would not asks the question, unlesswas very well apprized, according to my information, of what kneow-‘ ledge this witness has of it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2860 Do you know the contents of it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2862 Look and see, whether by the conaents of it that is the book you would sell as the Address to the Addressers, by Thomas Paine, if you had been asked by a customer for Paine’s Address to the Addressers, without any explanation 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2864 Look at the contents of it; I will have an auswer to this if] make you read it through

ATTORNEYGENERAL 2957 Put it into the hands of Mrs. Rickman. Did not you put them in the shop, and mark them as books to be sold? : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2963 You had them in your shop as books to sell
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2968 Y our lordship will sive me leave to observe, that Mr. Paine has en proved to be the author of the First Part of the Rights of Man; the Second Part of the Rights of Man—the Letter to the French nation; and I believe (though I am not accurate about that, becauseIwas not in court yesterday morning) a letter to Mr. ndas
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2971 Then we will make it evidence in a moment, because I shall now i to your lordships a resolution in the ook of the society, for printing part of this in the Argus, and then I shall read that part which is printed in the Argus. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2975 I will not trouble your lordship with this any farther. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2993 We will now prove that there was a person of the name of Wil liam Camage connectad with the Sheffield 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2994 Constitutional Society ; and that those letters are of his hand-writing. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3079 He was a member of the Corresponding Socicty, a delegate from the Constitutional Socicty. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3125 Did he mention any conntry in which pikes had Leen used 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3228 Look at that paper, Did you ever see that befure
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3230 Where did youseethat letter before 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3232 At what place did you see that letter in the possession of Davison 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3234 In Sheffield 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3236 Is that the letter we have read that was sent to Hardy? Did you everseethat paper before 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3238 You have seen it before
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3240 How long had Davison lived at Sheffield? I cannot rightly tell; he came to live at Sheffield about the beginning of this year. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3241 Where did he come from 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3243 Was he in one of the societies at Leeds
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3245 Your lordship will find his name to the letter from Leeds thag has been read. Had you any conversation about the place to which the person to whom that letter was directed was to send his answer to Moody 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3247 Did he give a reason for that
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3249 Had you any talk how that happened, that a letter was to come to him directed to Moody
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3251 What is Moody 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3253 Had he any thing to do with pikes
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3255 What is Widdison
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3270 Were there any of any other shape 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3272 Were there any made that were not shafted, of any other shape 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3274 “ Was that one that was not of that shape ever shown to Yorke
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3276 You saw that one
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3278 Those that were actually shafted were in the shape of a bayonet 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3280 And the handle seven feet long, and the blade about ten inches 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3282 What wood were the handles made of
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3284 Was there any particular reason given why the handles were made of fir
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3286 You see there is a reason in the letter read just now 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3290 Has Davison been long at Sheffield 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3292 Do you know where he is now
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3294 Had he left Sheffeld at that time
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3296 How long before you were taken upi— Nearl about the same time, I believe. Did you ever hear of such a thing as a cat
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3298 What is that? what is the other nanre of it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3300 What is a night-cat 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3302 Have you seen one
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3304 When 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3306 Had you ever seen such a thing before? No, never. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3307 What is the use of a night-cat
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3309 Why, how was a night-cat to act against cavalry
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3311 You, a Sheffield man, must know how such a thing as that could hurta horse 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3313 ould it run into his neck, or what other part 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3385 I certainty will not object to it.I desire to be understood, that I, by ao means, agree that it is a question that could he put, unless I consented to it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3415 Who told you that you had that right
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3440 You say this man told you he had seed some of these night-cats at Newcastle
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3442 Was it at any particular period of the history of the country, did he tell you
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3444 You say you expected opposition from the other party, at Sheftield
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3446 How came you and Davison to send a letter about sending pikes to London, in order to oppose the other party at Shetheld 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3448 So Davison sent a letter to London about pikes, you thinking they were to oppose the other party at Sheffield 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3450 You have talked about cavalry: what were the opposite party at Sheffield, who were to attack you with cavalry 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3452 How came you to talk about cavalry
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3454 Your opinion was about the opposite party at Sheffield, and Davison’s opinion, of course, about the opposite party in London 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3456 That is what he calls the bare-faced aristocracy of the present administration 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3458 What did you understand by that, when he showed you this letter, before he sent it to London, about the pikes, upon your oath 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3460 Why this Davison, who meant as little as you did, was not so bold as you, for he ran mney a fortnight before you were taken up
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3462 How came he to do that
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3464 You told us that the cheapness of the article was the reason why you thought of pikes
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3466 How much was the handle and the blade to cost 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3468 So that thirteen-pence would not pay for them
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3470 If the blade and the hoop had come to London, at the price of one shilling, there Would be some more expence to pay, that somebody else must provide for
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3472 ‘Did you ever hear of such a place as the Parrot, in Green Arbour Alley, London 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3474 Never 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3476 Had you any conversation with Davison about these pikes, after he showed you this letter
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3478 But after
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3799 Your lordship will recollect that we read a resolution from the books of the Constitutional Society, thanking the people of Sheffield for the manner in which they had spent the fast-day. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4096 While we wait for the next witness, we will read that part of the aper called the “ Fast Day, as observed at heffield, which relates to the landing the Hessian troops—This was in the year 1794. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4097 The following Extracts were read from a printed Pamphlet, intituled,God, iti a 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4098 Feb. 28th, 1794, being the Day appointed for a Genera Fast: to which are addeda Hy, and Reso utions. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4099 From the beginning to page 3.] “ FAST DAY. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4100  A Royal Proclamation having been issued, commanding February the 28th, 1794, tole observed asa General Fast, the Friends of Peace and Rerors, in Sheffield, determined to honour the Day in the most distinguished Manner. Accordingly the THOUSANDS of thut Town assembled upon a spacious plain near West-street, Backfields, where the Meeding was opened with ine 3 after whiche Serrous Lecrune, suitable to the Occasion, was read with great Energy to the immenx Concourse go, People, who listened in the most attentive Silence. A Hy«n, prepared for this Solemnity, was then sung in full Chores by the whole Assembly. Immediately after, Recaes Camace being called to the Chair, the following Resolutions were unanimously passed, and the Meeting dissolved in that orderly and peaceable Manner, which so ennently distinguishes the patriotic Inhabitants of Sheffield, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4101 “ A Serious Lecture. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4102 “In every age of the world, the cause of truth has always met with its OppOees, whenever it chanced to clash with the interests of a venal tribe of Kings, Courtiers, Priests, and their accomplices. By reading over the 16th chapter of 1 Kings, we find that this was the case; yet the Almighty was pleased by an act of Omnipotent Power, to overturn the malice and wicked intentions of that infamous tyrant Ahab, and the Satellites who surrounded him: for, in the presence of them all (though it made against them) Truth shone forth with redoubled splendour, and the very judgment which Elijah would probably have met with, had not God been for him, fell on those 2b-‘minable Deceivers of Mankind. I refer you to the chapter itself, and without further itroduction, I shall makea few remarks on the events of that period, as it must be obvious, to every ingenuous mind, that there is a great similarity betwixt the conduct of the rulers of that day, and those of the present: therefore it may be needful to observe, ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4103 “ First, Baal’s pee could not possibly succeed, because he to whom they prayed could not help them. Baal, being a name given to an Heathen God, who had no gxise ence except in the imagination of his devotees. And adly, They had a bad cause in band, therefore, were not likely to prevail; no motives to induce them but pride; no appetites to serve, but what were sensual and devilish, so that if they had offered sacrifice to the true tad cause, they would not have ob ro tained their end—for ‘ the ears of the Lord arenot open to the cries of the foolish, but unto 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4104 I. “the wise.’ 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4105 4 “It isin this point of light, I view, with concern, a combination of Kings apparently leagued against the cause of Freedom; a combination which I believe to be odious in the sight of Heaven, although for its support we are commanded a second time from the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4106 Throne, not of God, to fast and pray for the success of our arms over our brethren, who are struggling for every thing that is dear to 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4107 Man, and which is the will of God he should be possessed of Liserry, civil, political, and religious, Life without them is a burden. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4108 “ RESOLUTIONS. RESOLVED UNANIMOUSLY, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4109 “4. That War, the wretched artifice of Courts, is a System of Rapine and Blood, unworthy of rational beings, and utterly repughant to the mild and benevolent principles of the Christian Religion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4110 “a. That if the present war, be a war of Combined Kings against the people of France, to overthrow that Liberty which they are struggling to establish, it is, in our opinion, a war of the most diabolical kind. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4111 “3, That when public Fasts and Humiliations are ordered with the same breath, which commands the shedding of oceans of Human Blood—however they may answer the purposes of State Policy—they are solemn prostitutions of Religion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4112 “4, That the landing of Hessian troops in this country (a ferocious and unprincipled horde of Butchers) without consent of Parliament, has a suspicious and alarming appearance, is contrary to the spirit of our Constitution, and deserving of the marked indignation of every Englishman. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4113 “5. That it is high time to be upon our Guard, since these armed monsters may in a moment be let loose upon us ; particularly, as the erection of barracks throughout the kingdom may only have been an introductory measure to the filling them with Foreign Mercenaries. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4114 «6. That the high and free-born minds of Britons, revolt at the idea of such a Slavish System, and cannot be so far broken, as to kiss the hand which would chain them to its will. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4115 “7. That Peace and Liberty are the offspring of Heaven, and that Life without them is a burden, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4116 “8. That the Thanks of this Meeting are due to Earl Stanhope, for his Motion and spirited Specch for acknowledging the French Republic, and restoring Peace to our distressed country; for his Motions and able Speech in behalf of the persecuted and sufferagg patriots, Messrs. Muir, Palmer, Skirving, and Margarot, in which he nobly stood alone ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4117 and also for the whole of his truly animated and benevolent exertions in support of the injured Rights of the People. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4118 “9. The Thanks of this Meeting are also due to Mr. Sheridan, for his nervous and eloquent Speeches in the cause of injured Patriotism, and in support of the Constitution; and also to every other Member of Parliament who has nobly stood forward at this important crisis, in support of the Constitutional Liberties of Englishmen. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4119 “10. That if any thing had been necessary to have convinced us of the total inefficacy of argument against a Ministerial Majority, the decisions which have lately taken place in Pare liament, would have fully confirmed our opinion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4120 “41, That therefore the People have no remedy for their grievances, but a REFORM IN PARLIAMENT—a measure which we determine never to relinquish, though we follow our Brethren -in the same Glorious Cause to Botany Bay.

ATTORNEYGENERAL 4125 “ RESOLVED, That the Society approve the sentiments contained in the Serious Lecture delivered to the CONSTITUTIONAL SOCIETY at SHEFFIELD, on the 28th of last month—and earnestly recommend it to the perusal of all who think CIVIL and RELIGIOUS LIBERTY a Blessing. Resolved, That the Commanding a General Fast, for the purpose of imploring the Divine Father of Mercy and Peace to support and prosper us in the Aorrid act of deliberately destroying our fellow-creatures, is repugnant to the true spirit and principles of Christianity, where we are commanded to pray for our enemies, &c. And further considering, that a ee. part of the PEOPLE are unacquainted with the nature of the present WAR, either as to its justice or necessity (every endeavour being used to keep them ignorant of the real principles and design for which it was commenced) to approach and to supplicate the Omniscient Power, under such circumstances, and for such a purpose, must indeed be dreadful, since knowledge and conviction are wanting

ATTORNEYGENERAL 4129 ; “ March 21st, 1794. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4130 “ RESOLVED, That the Secretary of this Society be directed to write ta the FRIENDS OF PEACE AND REFORM, AT SHEFFIELD ; and to assure them, that this Society views with pleasure, their steady exertions to obtain a fair Representation of the PEOPLE of Great-Britain in Parliament; and the proper methods which they have taken to employ usefully those days which may be appointed for Public Fasts. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4131 “ D. Apams, secretary. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4504 Mr. Erskine has said repeatedly, that this witness had represented that he stated the whole speech that Mr. Yorke made—I say, that is not only not correct, but it is very far from correctness. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4512 But whom do you mean? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4795 Was Franklow a can low, member of the Corresponding Society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5029 Really that is not a proper way to examine witnesses. Lord Holt held strong language to such sort of an address from a counsel to a witness, who avowed himself a spy. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5031 I thought you had not heard his lordship. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5396 Do you mean Worship, the engraver 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5668 Y our lordship will recollect that Mr. Gosling, last night, spoke of a conversation, in Newgate, at which persons of the names of Roussel and Hillier were pean We are now going to prove, that ussel was a member of the London Corresponding Society, with a view to produce some papers found upon him. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5669 Did you find that paper 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5671  19th July, 1792. “ Division 37, Number 47; Mr. Roussel, No. 4, Shepherd-street, New Bond-street. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5672 Look at that book (showing the witness a pamphict, intituled, “ Explanation of an Encain of the Manual Exercise and Platoon iring ] has that your hand-writing upon it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5674 Where did you find that 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5676 Look at that song [showing it to the witness]
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5678 Where was Roussel’s apartment 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5689 I submit to your lordship, that the book must be evidence ; because the book, your lordship sees, is an explanation of the pareve plate, which has been produced, and which was found before the pons was in custody. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5693 The papers Iam now going to produce were found, one in the custody of Mr.Martin, the other of Mr. Thelwall; they were found in their custody certainly after the prisoner was apprehended, but they bear date in April, 1794; and they appear, upon the face of them, to have been prepared for the Chalk Farm meeting. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5695 Supposing the objection to be well founded, which I do not admit, I believe I can prove, that the paper had an actual existence in the month of April, 1794. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5697 I will prove, that they existed in the possession of Mr. Martin. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5785 It has not yet been read, but I am going to read it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6164 The court of exchequer never would permit that question to be asked. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6405 Did you find any thing in the possession of a person of the name of Hillier 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6407 You told us yesterday that you were at Edinburgh when the Scotch convention sat and was dispersed 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6409 You knew Maurice Margarot, did not you
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6411 Did you ever see any knife in his hand 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6413 Describe that knife.—It appeared to bea knife that opened with a spring between the haft and the blade: the knife and blade altogether was nine or ten inches long. — Was it easy or difficult to shut when it was once opened 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7224 I should suppose it was that of the 2d of May 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7261 I object to that question being put ; the principle which admits that it ought not to be asked if it were to a magistrate, admits that it ought not to be asked as to any body else ; for my part J cannot see what it has todo with the justice of the case. 3 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7270 I am sure I am consequence must be, that great erimes will addressing a Court that will always excuse & be passed over without any information being counsel, in any situation, who is acting upon offered about them, or without persons taking public grounds, if he should happen to be that part which is always a disagreeable part mistaken. I submit to your lordships, thatto take, but which at the same time it is the question which Mr. Erskine was about tonecessary should be taken for the interest of ut to the witness, is not aquestion to be put. the public. I say then, that the objection to W ith respect to what has been stated, as thethe yestion now proposed to be put,—always principle upon which the question was origi-stating that objection with the utmost deference to your lordships, which I do from a sense of duty founded upon what I think the clearest principle of duty to every individual who forms a part of the community—I state this—that after the witness has distinctly said that he mentioned this to a person who was to communicate it to those who would necessarily take care of the interests of society, in consequence of that information being communicated, that that channel of communication brings the name ofthat person within the tule the Court has laid down. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7278  Most surely. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7284 I really must object to the question. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7293 I wish to have it understood that the objection I now take is this: That Mr. Erskine has no right to ask the witness who it was that advised him to ive the information to a person who stands in the situation of a magistrate; for, I say, the person by whose advice the information is given, is to all intents and purposes, the informer. I wish to explain myself; who this person was, and what effect it may have in the evidence, it may be impertinent to sug gest; what it is intended to prove, really I not know; but your lordships will recollect that I stand here as the prosecutor for the public ; if I were in my own cause I could sacrifice, at my own pleasure, principles which appear to me to be the principles of public justice ; but, in the situation in which I stand, I do not know how I can regulate my conduct better towards the public, and towards thepaca than by acting upon the principles of law, as Iunderstand them, admitting at the same time, that no man is more likely to be mistaken: but this I will say distinctly, that I would not trouble your lordship with the ob jection that I am now stating, if I were not rfectly convinced, upon the best judgment Pax form, that the question cannot be put to the witness; and 1 mean, according to my duty, and with very humble deference to your lordships, to beg to have your lordships’ opinion. — 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7294 I know very well that it may be strongly argued, as it is very strongly argued by my learned friends, why, how are we to find out whether a witness does or does not speak truth, if we cannot ask him this sort of question—who advised you to do so and su? Suppose he says Mr. White, the solicitor for the treasury, should not I call upon that gentleman
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7296 In the Court of Exchequer it unquestionably happens every day, that a witness says I received an information that there were run-goods at such a place, I went there, and found them. There it is impossible to deny that the reasoning is just, which says, that the credit of a witness may be tried by asking bim, whom did you receive the informetion from? where ; under what circumstances ? andif the man were bound te answer to those questions, and he had spoken falsely, with respect to the when and the where he had received it, er under what circumstances, if it rested upon his evidence, wher you had falsified it with respect te the preceding perticuJars, yow could not believe him. gs to the subsequent particalars, and the defendant must be acquitted. Nobody will deny but that it is a case, but it has become a settled rule, beeause private mischief gives way to lic convenience ; and it is an hardship which occursin particular cases, in consequence of the Necessities of public justice. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7297 To explain amyselt, witbowk making an professions respocting my own conduct, might fairly say, I ought to have my gown stripped off my back, if I, acting upon any thing but coaviction that I am right upon principle, and a principle that 3 cannot, in my situation, sacrifice—suppose the prisoner Now trymg, im the course of a transaction of thas kind, where the consequence of his being copwicted was notwhatitis in this sort of case, but that which, with respect to his pecuniary fortune, would ruin him over and over again, the abstract justice of the case is exactly the same; and yet it is quite clear that that direct question, who gave you information, in consequence of which you prosecute for those penalties which are to ruin the defendant? could not be asked. Then I ask this, whether, in common sense, and upon principle, the man who advises him to inform, is not substantially and really the inftormer—and whether the principle ot law, which has said that you cannot ask this question, because the consequence of asking the question will be, that those who may not have nerves so strong as nvy friend and. myself, who would not care aa farthing if our names were mentioned ; but great numbers of persons in the world would not choose to have their names mentioned on such occasions; and with respect to that feeling, call it fear, or imprudent reserve, n is a substantial principle in Jaw, that aman shall not have his name disclosed. I have thought it my duty thus to state the grounds of my objection. I have made it, ecause I am convinced the objection is right; when E state that, your lordship will easily believe, I do not mean to contend that it is right, because I am convinced it is right, but because I cannot, I think, discharge my duty to the public without stating my objection as I feel the objection; and in cases of this great weight and importance, and indeed in any case, I do not know how the attorney general of the country can proceed more safely than according to his own notions; they may be mistaken ones, but according to his own notions of what the rule of justice is. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7333 You will attend to what the gentleman says
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7410 Did you find that paper any where? — Yes; I found it in the house of Mr. Adams. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7411 Extract of a Letter, dated Sheffield, 18th of October, 1792, signed, “ The Editor of the Patriot, addressed to Mr. Andrews, secretary to the Society of the Friends of Universal Peace, and the Rights of Man, at Stockport. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7412 “It only remains then for us, secing the great and innumerable difficulties we have to encounter, to cast about for the most likely and proper means and weapons by which to detend ourselves, and to forward and support such measures as it may be necessary to pursue; and on this head, my good sir, permit me to impress it on the minds of your society, that reason, imperial reason, must ever be our eneralissimo, or commander in chief; when Tay this, I beg leave to add, that art must be second in command ; by the word ‘ art,’ I do not mean craft or cunning, but that mode of application of our reason and arguments on different men, and on different occasions, which only a considerable degree of study, and practical knowledge also, of men and manners, can ever furnish us with, so as to make us proficients. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7413 “ Allow me then to observe to you, sir, that 1 perfectly coincide with you in opinion, with regard to the different societies appointing delegates to go into the different villages, and country places, for the purpose of informing their minds, and rousing them from the lethargy in which they seem plunged. I have already communicated the same idea to the London Constitutional and Corresponding Societies, and to those of Norwich and Manchester, and I hope it will soon be universally adopted by every one. But the grand object to. be attended to, on this head, is the chdice of men to be appointed; a neglect of this kind had iike to have had very awkward consequences in this neighbourhood, and, if not immediately checked, would have injured the cause of freedom very greatly; infinite care and circumspection will therefore be necessary on this head. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7414 “As I am on the subject, permit me to suggest to those members of your society, who may undertake this arduous, but honourable and praise-worthy task, that they cannot be too cautious in their mode of ceeding. The minds of men, for the wisest and best purposes, are formed by the great Creator as various and unlike each other as their faces, and their passions reign over each with the same uncertain and variegated swmyself and in the same manner that sir Robert Walpole (one of the elders and fathers of corruption) very justly observed, that every man has his price in the way of being hought; so we may fairly apply the same maxim to mankind in general, in the article of persuasion, and the dextrous method of bringing them from wrong opinions they may have formed, or prejudices they may have imbibed, by anattentive observation of their mtellectual faculties, and that leading passion of the sout which governs the main spring of their most material actions. For example, the generality of farmers in this county and Lancashire, are as ignorant as the brutes they ride to market, and so absorbed in the sordid idea of getting, that, provided they can keep up the prices of rain, cattle, &c. so as to answer their landlords, and pay their taxes, however enormous, they are too sluggish and indolent to thmk about reforms, or any thing of the kind, yet there is one string about their hearts, which, being skilfully touched, will make them dance to any time, and move to any measwre, This is the subject of tythes ; why does it touch them? Why sir? Because it is within the scope of their limited capacity. Ignorant as they are in other matters, they see and pungently feel the weight of this baneful and unjust devourer of all their improvements in agriculture and husbandry ; and I believe, did every tax operate in the same visible degree which this imposition does, I fear there would be an end to the idea of taxation being submitted to at all. Indeed, as taxes are laid on, at present, by those who do not represent us, the taxation is neither more nor less than a robbery; a submission to it, slavery. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7415 “But to return to my subject. In the same manner that a farmer may be roused by the mention of tythes, the shoe-makers may by the excessive dearness of leather, the innkeeper by the numerous and unnecessary standing army, and all by a temperate and dispassionate relation of the immense number of sinecure places, and useless offices, in which the corrupt and prostitute favourites, agents, and dependants of the rich and great, riot in the spoils and plunder wrested from the sweat of the brow, and continual labour of the body of the husbandman, the mechanic, the labourer, and the artificer. It is by no means a difficult matter to raise general indignation at the idea of so small a comparative number of useless, idle, and profligate drones, sucking and squandering away the honey potincd by such immense numbers of hard-toiling and industrious bees. If you (for I am certain you will be one of the most active of these-delegates) meet with men who have violent prejudices in favour of any abuse or party, never attack those prejudices directly, for that will only inflame and confirm them the more; pass them over fur the present, and engage their attention towards something else, in which they will listen with a less degrce of apprehension of being attacked in a favourite point; once gain their good apinion, and open their eyes to one evil, they will be more ready to hear you on others; till, at last, the favourite object by which their cyes were jaundiced, will appear in its true colours, and fall before your arguinents like all the rest. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7416 “ There is one thing above all others which requires to be particularly attended to, and that is, to endeavour to undcceive the mass -of people, with respect to those falsehoods which have been industriously propagated by the enemies to a reform, in order to blind, delude, and terrify all ranks of people: who are any way independent, or possessed of Property: One of these falschoods is, “ that the advocates of reform wish to introduce a “levelling scheme, or an equal partition of property,’ This alarms the farmers, and indeed all classes of men, who, by their industry, or other adventitious circumstances, are possessed of the goods of this world. So many vile ministerial prints as have propagated this doctrine, aided and assisted by the private representations, or rather misrepresentations, of the clergy, and other tools of overnment, and of privileged orders, have da very wonderful and baneful effect on the multitude, and have stamped a dread of reform on the minds of many that I know, whose situations in life would induce one reasonably to suppose it impossible, so completely to impose upon them; however, it always has been the case, that falsehoods, boldly uttered, may prevail for a time, but must be overwhelmed, in the end, by the bright and sacred energies of truth. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7417 o explain this matter, and many others properly, will require great coolncss, moderation, and patience. I have found the tollowing method answer best: ‘ Do you know “such a gentleman?’ naming sume one of large property and good character in the neighbourhood, who is known to be a friend to a reform; ‘ Yes.’—‘ Well, and do you suppose that he would promote a scheme that would occasion and oblige him to part with property he possesses, in order for it to be di
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7418 ‘ vided amongst strangers whom he never saw or heard of ?’ ‘No’—“ Why then should you suffer yourself to be imposed on by such aa idle tale fabricated and calculated for the purpose of raising a dread in you against “those more enlightened of your fellow-citi“zens who wish for a reform, as yeu would, “did you see its necessity; a dread which “may cause you to shut your eyes upon op‘ pressive excise and game-laws, exorbitant tythes, an unnecessary standing army, kept on foot at the expense of two millions and a half, for the purposes of influence and cor‘ruption; .a pension-list, which is a disgrace to the government, and a stigma and re‘proach on the spirit and prudence of the “nation ; sinecure places, for the mere pos“sessing of which, hundreds of individuals receive thousands a year each, for duing nothing at all, either for the public service or their own; in short, such an enormous accumulation of taxes, and so prodigal an expenditure of their produce, as no nation on the earth ever heard of or submitted to before. To make you shut your eves, and continue blind to these enormities, those idle and futile tales are villanously dispersed “abroad ; but believe them not, consult your own reason, and it will show you that there is a palpable lie on the face of every one of them?’ Then explain the nature, aim, and end of your society, mvite them to attend it, and to judge for themselves: If they do so, they will soon aid and assist you, by adopting similar ones in their several neighbourhoods, till, in time, they will overspread the whole surface of this sca-girt isle. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7419 “ At present, sir, I will not trouble you further on the subject, which 1 now quit tw return to the conduct and regulatian of your own society, and all others which may arise hereafter; and as to them, I think the inakeepers in Stockport, Manchester, &c. have given you a hint and lesson, for which you ouglit to esteem yourselves for ever obliged to them. I own their insolence and audacity in proceeding as they have done, is beyond example, but only deserying of contempt; as such, leave them to themselves ; public-houses were never worthy of receiving such guests, whose sacred and important duty require and demand to be performed in mansions more dignified and respectable; your meetings should be at the houses of one -another in honourable rotatien ; and, to pree. vent inconvenience frum too great a number, not more than ten or twelve at the most should compose a primary or district meeting; more members may be admitted in each district, till they reach twenty or twenty-four according to the number fixed on—but thea immediately should divide into two district: meetings; the several districts should send each one member, by election, to a meeting of delegates, and this meeting of delegates should elect out of their own body a certain nuigber, which is to compose 3 select com: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7420 mittee ; this select committee to manage the correspondence, and every other important concern for the whole of the districts in any town or parish, subject always to the revision and approbation of the districts; the delegates and select committee to be chosen only for a limited time, before the expiration of which, others to be elected as betore, from the districts, to supply their places, by which rotations every member would in time become qualified to be a delegate and a select commnittce-man, though he might not be soon his first entrance as a district member. These are only hints on which you may improve or enlarge as much as you please. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7421 We will now read a draft of an answer to this letter, which was found likewise in the possession of Mr. Adams; it has nodate; it has two handwritings init; I may, perhaps, trouble your lordships, in the course of this cause, with evidence to prove whose hand-writings they are, but that is not necessary to enable me to read it; 1 wish todraw your lordships attention particularly to the two last paragraphs.

Upon your oath, were not you present when that resolution was come to
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7989 It has been distinctly proved in evidence, that these Scotch societies had stated that more effectual means should be used. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8051 It is due from me to state to your lordships how I shape the case. We have now, as your lordships recollect, proved by a letter on the 17th of May, 1793, from Mr. Hardy, by a Mr. Urquhart, who was then going to Ediaburgh, that he sent this proposition to the Convention a Edinburgh, to associate not only that society with the London Corresponding Seciety, but both with every other society throughout the nation—that in answer to that, Mr. Skirving, who appears to be the secretary, in a lettor which was found in the possession of the prisoner states—“ If either you in England, or we in Scotland, should ateempt separately the reform which we seek to obtain, we should, by so doing, only expose our weakness, and manifest our ignorance of the corruption which opposes our important undertaking
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8053 Be 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8054 Teast to be ready to associate
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8056 Your lordships will give me leave to put you in mind also, that this society wrote to Sheffield, to Leeds, and'I think to one or two other places, to send delegates to the convention in Scotland; they did send delegates to the convention in Scotland; and: Skirving, whose name has before occurred, aj pears to have written circular letters upon the arrival of the delegates of the two English societies, desiring all the societies to come 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8057 Your lordships likewise recollect, that we have given in evidence, letters that were written by Hardy, and also by peeet and Gerrald, who were delegates in Scotland ; and likewise letters written from those delegates to Hardy, whilst the convention was sitting. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8058 Hardy, in a letter of the 8th of November, 1793, says—“ That part of your letter which mentioned your visiting different towns in Scotland, for the purpose of promoting the cause; they were pleased with the idea, bat they thought that it could not be put in prac tice, on account of the necessary supplies, which come in but slowly
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8060 Your lordships will also be pleased to recollect that, on the 8th of December, 1793, Mar. garot, who was then in Scotland, writes to the secretary of the London Corresponding Society, a letter—There is also a letter of the 22d of December, 1793, in which M: writes them, to come to very strong resol tions
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8062 Then upon the 20th of January, 1794, your lordship will also recollect, that at the Globe: tavern they came to precisely the same resolution, as that which was come to in the convention in Scotland, before that conven tion was dispersed
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8064 After the dispersion of the convention, these societies no longer existed as a convention; but the Friends of the People, and other affiliated societiesin Scotland, proceeded to form committees of Ways and Means, and Union: —I have therefore, I submit, clearly laid a foundation to show that up to this period, all those societies were affiliated, that is the London and Scotch Societies; and that it is exceedingly clear, whatever convention was to called, was to be a convention bath of the people of England and Scotland. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8065 his being so we have-also laid before your lordships evidence, of which I will say this only, that it is evidence to go to the jury, that the aftiiated societies in London, many of the members ot them were providing themselves with muskets and pikes; that the Sheffield society, which corresponded as well with Scotland as with London, was also providing pikes :, then I conceive that I am at liberty to proveasatactin thiscase, the providing of pikes, agd the actual existence of nina of resistance to the government in Scotland at the same time, precisely upon the same principle as if we were now trying what would be a much more manifest overt act, I mean an open rebellion in the country—I conceive, upon the principle laid down in lord Lovat’s, and other cases, that there could not be a particle of doubt, that if I had charged an open act of rebellion in England, that I should have been entitled to show that in fact there was in Scotland, another armed force resisting the king's forces there; even though I did not show any communication by letter between them, so as to make it probable that they were co-operating with each other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8066 ‘I submit to your lordships, that this is evidence to go before the jury, leaving them to judge of the application that it has. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8069 In otder that I may state the thing entirely to the Court, I beg to put the Court in mind that we have ew proved that a circular letter which was zo call this convention, has been actually found in Scotland, and that that isa circular letter, which is written after resolutions which state that they are to have a convention of the people. ‘ 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8071 Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8264 It has now been spoken of, that Watt gave orders for pikes— we shall be able to prove by the time at which the orders were given, that it was before Hardy was apprehended. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8277 I think my evidence will not take up more than forty minutes, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8298 I am now going to call a witness to prove that a paper was found in the possession of Mr. Thelwall, and also to prove that another paper of the same sort was found in the possession of Mr. Martin, being of the hand-writing of Martin. These papers were found after the apprehension of Mr. Hardy. When I have proved that the papers were found in the possession of Martin and of Thelwall, I shall then go on to prove by a witness or two, whom t shall call for that purpose, that they existed in the possession of each of them long before the apprehension of Mr. Hardy: they purport upon the face of them to be iagered for the general meetin; of the Corresponding Society, upon the 14¢! of April, 1794, at Chalk Farm. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8303 Mr. Martin and Mr. Thelwall, in whose custody the papers were found, were persons who, together with Mr. Hardy, were appointed to prepare the proceedings for the Chalk Farm meeting. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8305 Where did you find that paper 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8308 [showing it to the witness. ]—I found this in Mr. Martin's chest in the King’s-beneh prison. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8310 On the 29th of May. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8311 Look at that paper do you know whose hand-writing that is

ATTORNEYGENERAL 8333 Look at the top of this paper, and tell me whether it was before the date there mentioned, or not

ATTORNEYGENERAL 8440 Now LI take it there is no objection to reading the paper; therefore I desire it may be read, and I would beg of your lordships and the jury, not only to attend to what is left in the paper, but to what is struck out of it to look at the paper itself. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8441 “ At a general Meeting of the London Corresponding Society, held at — on Monday, the 14th day of April, 1794. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8442 “ Citizen in the chair. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8443 “ Resolved, That all meee ens legislative, and judicial powers, are the rights of the people; and though the people have delegated those their original powers to others, in trust, for the benefit of the community, yet the rights themselves are reserved by the people, and cannot be absolutely parted with by the people to those persons who are employed to conduct the business of the state. J 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8444 “ Resolved, That the constitution of England is held by the King, Lords, and Commons, and other officers appointed by the people in trust, for the benefit of the people ; and though these trustees may regulate and improve the constitution, yet they cannot alter or subvert it without committing treasom against the nation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8445 Resolved, That Magna Charta, or THE GREAT CHARTER OF THE LIBERTIES OF ENGLAND, made in the reign of king John; THE PETITION OF RIGHTS, assented to by parliament in the reign of kin: Charles 1st and the several laws made at ani in consequence of the Glorious Revolution in the year 1688, are declaratory of those parts of the constitution of England, which are iar and by them respectively declared. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8446 “ Resolved, That the office of KING of England was not instituted by the people merely as an office of profit and honour to the king, but he was so appointed as chief trustee and guardian of the constitution and rights of the people, and that important and laborious penal duties are annexed to the regal office, the objects of which are to promote the good of the people, and preserve their rights in full vigour from innovation and corruption. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8447 Resolved, That it is the duty of the king to preserve the constitution of England and the rights of the people against every encroachment; and in order to enforce that duty, the following oath is required to be taken by every king on his accession to the throne of Great Britain, to wit: the arch-bishop or bishop shall say—“ Will you solemnlypro“ mise and swear to govern the people of this “kingdom of England, and the dominions thereto belonging, according to the statutes “in parliament agreed on, and the laws and customs of the same?’ 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8448 he king or queen shall say, ‘ I solemnly “promise so to do.’ Archbishop or bishop— Will you to your power cause law and jus‘tice in mercy to be executed in all your judgments?’ ANS. ‘I will’ 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8449 “ After this, the king or queen, laying his or her hand on the holy Gospels, shall say— ‘The things which I have before promised I “will perform and keep; so help me God’ and then shall kiss the book. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8450 “ Resolved, That his present majesty, kin, George 8rd, on his accession to the throne o these realms, did solemnly take the said oath. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8451 “ Resolved, That the constitutional rights of the people have been violated, and that it is the duty of the people, in the present atarming crisis, to assemble and inquire into the innovations or infringements which have been made upon the rights of the people, and how far the declarations of the constitution, as they were settled at the aforesaid Revolution, remain in force, and which of them have been violated, and by whom; and also whether such innovations, infringements, and violations, have been committed from the negligence or corruption of those who have been intrusted with the government of the state. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8452 “ Resolved, That this society do invite the ee to meet in their respective nighbourjoods, to elect one or more person or persons as delegates to meet in a convention, to be held on the day of. next, at such place as shall be appointed by the secret committee of this society; and that the poe so elected do forthwith transmit to the secretary of this society, No. 9, Piccadilly, London, the vouchers of their several elections, in order that the place of meeting may be duly notified to them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8453 “ Resolved, That it is the right and the bounden duty of the people to punishall traitors against the nation, and that the followin, words are now not a part of the oath of allegiance; to wit, ‘I declare that it is not lawful, ‘upon any pretence whatever, to take arms against the king.’ 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8485 I mentioned hast night that I had proved the order to be given for them before the apprehension of the prifoner; the order by Watt and M‘Bwan. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8486 Mr. Gidts
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8488 We have proved that Stock produced to Watt and Ross a printed circular ietter, signed Thomas Hardy, which is verbatim the same circular letter, a bandle of which was found in the possession of the prisoner; we have already proved that there was a conversation at that time, in which Watt desired that Stock would bring about a communication with Hardy ; we certainly have not proved that Stock brought about that communication ; but, I submit to your lordships, that if we prove the order for the pikes to have been given previous to that time, that the execution of that order follows naturally, and necessarily upon it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8514 Having mentioned this, I would ask, had you any talk with Hillier about the ale-house in Green-Arbourcourt
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8516 When did you first see Hillier’s pike? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8563 Martin, in his letter to Margarot, in Scotland, says, Gay will tell you more than I dare mention. I am going to read the account of Gay’s being admitted a member of the Constitutional Society; he was proposed by Mr. Tooke, and seconded by Mr. Bonney.

ATTORNEYGENERAL 8576 You mentioned a person of the name of Gay, who was in the King’s-bench prison
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8578 Do you know where he lived before he went into the King’s-bench prison
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8580 Was it Duke-street 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8582 My Lord, I hav now finished the evidence on the part of the prosecution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8877 I object to that question ; you should ask him what his object as. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8878 was, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8891 I object to that question. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8893 I will not have the question put in that form; I am afraid of questions that ought not to be put. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8894 I am afraid of pe pete that ought to be put, but of questions ought not to be put. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8895  ‘saan 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8897 I think you would not have made the observation if you did. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8908 That Gentleman asked you whether Mr. Hardy had ever communicated to you that letter from Sheffield, you immediately said no. Now I should be glad to ask you how you knew what letter it was that that gentleman alluded to—what is the letter that you mean to speak of, when you say Hardy never comsnunicated it to you 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8910 I should be glad to know what Sheffield letter you mean 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8912 The witness overheard that. ‘ 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8918 I must entreat your lordships to ms and I hold it to be m duty to do it. There is a gentleman who is not counsel in the cause, who sits next Mr. Gibbs, and when I asked the witness the queetion, what letter it was, I heard him in this part of the Court, asI believe some other gentlemen did, say, “ The letter about pikes. Now Ido not mean to say, and I desire in justice to that gentleman to observe, that I do not mean to say, by any means that he intended the witness should hear that explanation given to Mr. Gibbs; I do not believe it; I therefore disavow that; but I must desire that no gentleman should sit next the counsel for the defendant, or the counsel for the crown, who under, not the colour, I will not. use that word, but under the fact of commuNicating and conversing with the defendant’s counsel, should, in point of fact, lead, I do not mean to say in point of intention—the witness to giving an answer which he could not have given. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8926 tow long have you been a member of this society

ATTORNEYGENERAL 8939 Did you ever see a printed account of what passed there
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8941 Which were afterwards printed 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8943 Were the resolutions that you saw in print a correct account of what really did pass there
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8945 Then that being a correct account of what did pass upon the 20th of January 1794, you mean to state to the Court and the Jury that the proceedings, as contained in that printed paper, were according to your ideas correct und poate and according 1o the law of the Jand, as you understand 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8947 Tt so, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8948 You said you were at Chalk Farm 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8950 And you also mean to state as far as your opinion goes, that the proccedings at ChalkFarm were exactly what they really ought to be
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8952 Perhaps you were at the meeting in Breillat'’s yard when delegates were chosen to be sent to Scotland 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8954 Not being there, perhaps you did not know the fact that a delegate was sent to the convention in Scotland 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8956 Knowing the fact, you approved of that measure, I suppose 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8958 Did you ever hoar of the Secret Committee in your society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8960 ‘ ‘Then having -heard of the Secret Com:mittec, do you happen to know who the Secret Committee were composed of

ATTORNEYGENERAL 8964 Every answer that you have given to me yet proves to me that you are an honest man. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8965 This society, whose proceedings wer feqeobl, had a Secret Committee 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8967 Was it known among the body in genen! who the Secret Committee were 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8969 ‘Then youmean to say, giving this characte of the proceedings of this society, that ya remained in the society; there being a secret committee of persons whose names you dd not know, of course you did not know whit were the proceedings of any committee, the names of which committee you did ma know

ATTORNEYGENERAL 9017 You consider all the proceedings at the Globe-tavern on the 20th of January, and also the proceedings at Chalk Farm, as in your opinion, quite peaceable and constitutional proceedings 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9019 That is your notion of the matter
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9021 You sing some songs now and then in your society do not you 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9023 How came you never te sing them in the socicty 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9025 Is it done on purpose, or how happens that

ATTORNEYGENERAL 9043 You have heard this song sung, you say, “Plant, plant the tree?’ —I cannot say, upon my recollection, that I ever have heard it.

ATTORNEYGENERAL 9638 I have no object to what the gentleman pleases to say
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9640 mediately asked him the intent, or ultimate end and design that this society had in view, and he told me it was a reform of parliament, that is to say, of the House of Commons, upon eaceable and constitutional principles; he farther added upon the same principles which his grace the duke cof Richmond and the right hon. William Pitt were engaged in, in the year 1782. I have frequently, in conversation, inquired of him, and tried to suck out, to gain what was the inteut of the society, when I heard something about these reports of the Committee of the House of Commons, and so on, and he told me by all means it was to obtain a parliamentary reform upon constitutional principles, in a peaceable manner. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9668 You did not belong to any of these societies
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9670 Did you ever see a paper published as the proccedings at Chalk-Farm, with Mr. Hardy’s name to it

ATTORNEYGENERAL 9675 Did you know that Mr. Hardy was a member ofa society that had published resolutions in support of Mr. Thomas Paine’s Rights of Man
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9677 Then I need not ask you, I take for granted, whether publishing those resolutions in favour of Paine’s Rights of Man, shows the sort of man that you would suppose honours the king? what is your answer to that
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9679 Did you cver see the bouk, called Paine’s Rights of Man
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9681 Do you know that Mr. Paine was a member of the Constitutional Society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9683 Do you happen to know Mr. Bogue, a dissenting minister

ATTORNEYGENERAL 9706 Then he never told you any thing about the roceedings of the London Corresponding Society, either at Chalk-Farm or any of those other places
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9723 Thatis not a proper question. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9734 This convention that was talked ‘about—not having said one word about a convention. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9749 You are secretary to a society calling themselves the Friends of the People 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9751 You know there is a society in London called the Society for Constitutional Information 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9753 It may possibly have occurred to you, as secretary to the Society of the Friends of the People, to know that the latter society rejected all correspondence with the former
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9755 Did you happen to know that the prisoner at the bar was an associated member of that society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9757 Then you being secretary to the committee of the Society of the Friends of the People, and the Society of the Friends of the People having rejected all correspondence with the Society for Constitutional Information, you did not know that the prisoner was an associated member of the Society for Constitupane Information 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9759 Do you remember a letter being written by your society to the Society for Constituae Information, from lord John Russel 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9761 Do you remember any correspondence between your society, the Friends of the People, and a society at Sheffield
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9763 Do you recollect whether that was in the month of May, 1792, or not
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9765 Do you happen to know, that the society at Sheffield, in the month of May, 1792, wrote a letter to the Constitutional Society, whose correspondence your society bad rejected, saying, they would have nothing more to do with the Friends of the People, because they were not pursuing the principles of the rights of man
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9767 ‘Do you recollect what were the reasons why the Society of the Friends of the Feople would have nothing more to do with the Society for Constitutional Information

ATTORNEYGENERAL 9777 Have you seen the London aneeponing Suciety’s resolutions at Chalk-farm
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9779 They wrote to your society about a convention, I believe —They did. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9780 You rejected that
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9782 I believe your society had some correspondence with the London Corresponding Society ; during all these proceedings, do you recollect any application they made to you to know the principles of your society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9784 Did your society inform them what length they meant to go at that time
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9786 Do I understand you right, that you never heard of the prisoner’s being an associated member of the Constitutional Society whose correspondence your society had rejected; that you knew nothing of the address of the London Corresponding Society of the 6th of August, 1792; that you knew nothing except what you have learned now of the proceedings of the 20th of January, 1794, and of the proceedings at Chalk-farm
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9788 Look at this printed paper [showing it to the witneanl is this an account of the proceedings of your society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9790 As you were secretary to the society, you can inform me whether the nee whose names appear here, are all members of the Society of the Friends of the People
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9792 You are aware of the fact, supposing it to bea fact, that after the Society of the Friends of the People had rejected correspondence with the Constitutional Society, by their letter, that some individuals still remained members of both societies 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9807 That is a question never put. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9837 Were you a member of the Corresponding Society

ATTORNEYGENERAL 10130 What, the paper called the Gazetteer
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10132 Then am I to understand you, that you know of the proceedings of the convention, as they appeared in that Gazetteer

ATTORNEYGENERAL 10140 You say you were at the Castle-hill
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10142 you remember that when somebody Proposed to petition the House of Commons, It was negatived, and it was determined to petition the House of Commons no more

ATTORNEYGENERAL 10148 Was he a Sheffield man 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10150 You knew a great deal of him, I believe, after he did come

ATTORNEYGENERAL 10174 He was a peaceable well-disposed man 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10176 Have you seen their letters in your society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10178 They were also peaceably disposed, and associated for the same end as yourself, no doubt 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10180 Tell me whether that showing the witness a letter] is Mr. Campbell Brown’s hand-writing or not, according to your belief
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10182 You know upon the Castle-hill, that there was a motion made to petition the House of Commons 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10184 Upon your oath were you in the secret that that motion was made, by contrivance, to be negatived 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10186 0 you know it now
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10188 You know it no otherwise

ATTORNEYGENERAL 10192 And many hundred others of you, I suppose, did not 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10235 Please to ask him what his intention was. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10240 It is not worth arguing. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10403 Read up that sentence : “ Jf the Society for Constitutional Information in London, should vouchsafe so far to notice us, as to enter into a connexion and correspondence with us, it cannot fail of promoting honour, and adding strength to our feeble endeavours, and to the common cause, which is the entire motive we have in view.

ATTORNEYGENERAL 10630 The letter that has last been read you say’ you took to Mr. Grey to be signed 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10632 It was signed
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10634 Did you send the letter by the post, or deliver it yourself to Mr. Ashton 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10636 Did you know Mr. Ashton
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10638 Do you know what Mr. Ashton is
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10640 What was he at that time 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10642 I see you direct to Samuel Ashton, esq.
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10644 ThatI suppose was a thought of your own? It was not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10645 By whose direction did you direct it to Samuel Ashton, esq.
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10647 Did any of them know Mr. Ashton’s situation in life
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10649 You told us the other day, when you were here, that you did not know that Mr. Hardy had been an associated member of the Constitutional Society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10651 jouseeyour letter is of the 24th of May
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10653 Do you know, that the same Mr. Ashton, upon the 26th of the same month, wrote to the Constitutional Society, in London, a letter, which I hold now in my hand, stating, that he had received your moderate letter, the letter of the Friends of the People; an stating, to that Society, that, as your principles were not according to the rights of man, the Sheffield Society would have nothing ‘to do with you, except so far as the Constitutional Society would afterwards permit
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10655 Have you had any communication with Mr. Ashton since
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10657 A short time previous to this, I think about the 27th of March, your Society, the Friends of the People, had expressed their reasons for having nothing to do with the Constitutional Society; and had stated to them, that the would have no more correspondence with them
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10659 It was before this letter of your's to Sheffield 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10661 Did you know, that twelve members of that very Sheffield Society, to which you were writing, had been associated with the Constitutional Society, whose correspondence you had before rejected
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10663 Do you mean to say, that, at the time you permitted this letter to go from the Friends of the People, to Sheffield, that you knew that that Sheffield Society had twelve members associated with that Constitutional Society, with whom your Society had refused to correspond 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10665 T do not mean to insinuate that you did, for I do not believe that you did—then, you did not know that fact
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10667 You observed my learned friend read to you a great many very respectable names; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10668 ow many of those gentlemen have quitted your society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10671 Your society received this letter of the 14th, from Sheffield, as a proof of their moderation
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10673 And you treated it so, of course, and knew nothing of the letter that, on the 26th of May, they wrote to the Constitutional Society, such as I have been stating to you 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10675 You were going to state, that some gentle. men had left your society about this time
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10677 Do you recollect the names of them
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10679 Have you had the curiosity to read over the names of those respectable gentlemen, whose names are printed jn this list Certainly. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10680 Can you inform me how many of those entlemen were, and continue to be mem ie of that Constitutional Society, all corre pondence with which you had rejected
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10696 When did Ms. Wharton become a member of your Society
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10698 I presume you always inquired who the persons were that you addressed your letters to, before you wrote an; thing to them !—Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10699 Is lord Daer a member of your society
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10701 I understood you to say, there was an aiswer to your letter of the 24th of May, from Sheffield? —Yes ; there was. Was that from the same Mr. Ashton
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10703 In as moderate terms as the letter you bad answered 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10705 Do you remember whether that letter, in those moderate terms, was dated before or after the 26th of ag hice must have beea dated after, because the answer was on 24th of May, and this is the reply to that answer. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10706 It might have been written by the retura of the post 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10720 Did your society know what had been the proceedings of the British Convention; I do not speak of the Scotch Convention, but the British Convention 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10722 I observe you say, the answer must be dated later than the 26th
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10724 Why
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10726 If your letter went from London on the 24th, and was answered by the return of post, the date of the answer must be the 26th? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10729 Did you ever know a man who was both a republican and a constitutional man, in one post ? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10897 What did he amean? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11163 I must object to this mode ; I shall be obliged to Mr. Erskine to ask his grace the duke of Richmond his question, without stating, by a preamble, why he asks it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11172 The better, and the more regular way will be, that the letter shown to the Sheffield witness, and which, he says, contained the plan that they looked to should be read, and then it should be examined by somebody with that now produced by the duke of Richmond. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11180 What is the evidence you propose to adduce? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11192 I do not ko what it is Mr. Erskine is now alluding to; but if he will state to me that it is a proceeting of the House of Lords of this kingdoa, which he conceives can be of use to a subjed of this kingdom, standing at that bar, letit be what it will, if it be a proceeding of be House of Lords, I will not object to it 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11225 I really must object to this sort of examination, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11227 Itis. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11287 I rise in the first place to state to your lordships the objection which I have to the question that was addressed by my learned friend to the witness. 1 hoped that this objection had followed so immediately upon a conduct that I am persuaded betrayed, on my part, no wish to shut out any evidence that appeared to me to be admissible, that my learned friend would sincerely have given me credit, as he now states he does, for making this objection upon a ublic principle. I beg to say again, what I ; Lies had occasion to say befure in the course of this trial, that it belongs to every man in acourt of justice, as it dues to every man elsewhere, to be liable to error; it 1s not, therefore, with any confidence that I must be right, in the objection which I take, that I presume to trouble your lordships with this objection, but it is in consequence of an opinion that I am right; and if that be my serious opinion, recollecting that I stand here as prosecutor for the public, I am not at liberty, whatever my inclination might be, to sacrifice what appears to my own mind to be a great principle in judicature, adopted and acted upon for the benefit of the public, and, therefore, for the benefit of every individual who forms a part of it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11288 When my learned friend stated that he had scen this objection brewing for some days, he will allow me to state to him what I do state upon my personal honour, if it be necessary for me to pledge that to him, that so far from brewing this objection, I do state, that I do not look forward enough into cases to anticipate such objections, for I protest I had not foreseen that such evidence as this would be offered, and had not considered it. But the learned and able manner in which my friend has reasoned upon it, I think of itself is some degree of testimony in support of what I am now saying, that it is an objection which, at least, had colour enough in it to invite the minds of two able counsel to apply their abilities to repel the objection, if it should be taken, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11289 Having stated thus much—what your lordbell has heard with respect to the case of Holt, and an expression which has fallen from my learned friend in discussing this objection I hope will prevent its appearing to those to whom I am now addressing myself, improper to make this observation upon it. When a motion was made for a new trial, because Mr. Justice Wilson was supposed to have rejected evidence which he ought to have admitted, my learned friend, in the discharge of the duty which he owed to his client, contended as strongly that that evidence was admissible, as day that this evidence is admissible; and I am perfectly persuaded that if any man had Jeft the court after he had heard my friend, he would have gone out of court with an opinion, which I hope my friend will not be too incautiously industrious in propagating, that there was a difference in the law of evidence, as it affected a newspaper printer at Newark, and as it affected other persons whose paper he proposed should be received in evidence. My lord, I say incautiously do it—and I think it my duty to say it, because when in the course of a trial affecting the life of the person who now stands at this bar, and not only affecting his life, but affecting the interest which every man in this country has in his e has done this us) 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11290 own life, and affecting every interest that aa be dear to him, I wish my learned nec would at once either decline talking of tk difference between a poor shoe-maker ai men of higher rank, or that he would su the facts upon which he thinks it fit to bed that sort of language. My lord, we livea a country in which the providence of the law, like the midenee ? God, is rer hs high and low, rich and poor; and speakny ior myself, I desire to be disgraced from ts moment, if in the course of this trial, either have conducted myself, or can conduct mrs in such a manner as not to do that justice & this prisoner which the law means should te done to him. 1 think I should be worthy oi that death, and ten such deaths as the pn soner must suffer, provided he is found guir upon this trial. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11291 Having said thus much, I proceed to su to your lordships that undoubtedly I ast that the questions with respect to the eft of evidence, and the admissibility of evidence, are perfectly distinct : for instance, if in te case of any person you find him at a tavert, speaking respectfully of the hereditary bility of the country, and of his majesty, 3 the situation and character which he holdst this country; and you find, on the olx hand, papers in which he holds perlecty different language upon other occasions; fact whether he held that conversation at ts! tavern or not, may or not be evidence ing to the circumstances under which th! conversation is held. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11292 In the case now before the Court, your lortships will recollect that it has been given 2 evidence that Mr. Tooke (one of the pers! whose name occurs in this indictment) at the Crown and Anchor, upon the 2nd of May, 1792, spoke with great respect of the hereditay nobility of the country, and spokealsowith rpectof the majesty of theking. Whyisthaterdence? clearly for this reason (without exam ing whether it would be evidence forany ob reason) namely, that it was a transactionof be two societies met in the course of the buss which they had been doing ; and it came ot also upon the cross-examination, which 6 another circumstance that will require 0 materially attended to. So with respect the prisoner at the bar—if, for instance, has been evidence given of the effect of ers, that the language which he ws fold was to be such language as pi would permit; — that be received psy which were not communicated to the sodely: and one private letter, in which a propos is stated, that monarchy is to be ripped UP by the roots; that in the answer to that it stated to those who held that conversst with him about monarchy—do not talk monarchy—do not talk about demo] —let your language be confined vod versal suffrage and annual parliaments all the rest of your objects will erg’ say there may be a great number of circumstances given in evidence, but then the question will follow, whether the decla‘ ration the man held is given under such circumstances at such time, and in the course of a conversation which makes that declaration evidence. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11293 Now with respect to lord George Gordon’s ease, if I recollect rightly, the principle upon which the declarations were received in evidence was this—that in that case the declarations were really a fact, for whatever declaration accompanies the transaction, whatever declaration is a part of the transaction that is done, is part of the fact that is doing, and upon that ground the declarations were admitted; it does not weaken the observation at all, that evidence was given in ’ that case, that lord George Gordon went to some magistrate, or some other person, whilst the mob was over-ruling tbe civil power of the country, for any conversation that was held by lord George Gordon duringthe existence of these riots, and with reference to them, he being a party in them, was t a declaration made at the time, and upon all the principles of evidence, was, therefore, connected with the transaction. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11294 With respect to the case stated last by my learned friend—Crohagan’s case, I take that to be as distinguishable from the present evidence upon the same principle, the object was to prove the view with which the man came into England ; he declared that he would Gome into England to kill the king; he did eome into England. Your lordship knows that hismaking the declaration, thoughit would be pimizhable in another way, yet still would not e high treason, if he had not come into England ; and, upon the whole of the evidence, the coming into England made a part of the transaction with the declaration he had made, it was an overt act of high treason, because it was then understood to be a fact done with the intention which the indictment imputed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11295 My learned friend has said respecting Rosewell’s sermon, that no sermon can be high treason, I will not argue that, but I submit it is very dangerous to state that no sermion can be high treason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11297 It is matter of good fortune then that I have stated it. No man in the world will suppose that I mean any thing else than what I am now saying ; —lIt does happen in the course of what counscl are stating, that they may conceive themselves to say what did not fall from them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11300 Then I can only say for myself what I am about to say for my learned friend, that it happens to those whose attention is called to the discussion of subjects, that words now and then which really fall from gentlemen do not strike the ear of those to Eon they are addressed, who ought to hear them; meaning at the same time to say distinctly that I did not hear them, but it is satisfaction sufficient to me that my friend permits they should be ut in. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11301 What is the evidence in the case of Rosewell, and many others to which my friend has alluded? In the first place he has not stated with respect to these trials who were the witnesses that were allowed to speak to these facts; he has not stated whether these circumstances were asked upon cross-examination; he has not stated whether witnesses were called to general character, and then gave in evidence these circumstances, in explanation of the general character which they had given; he has not stated whether the witnesses who spoke to these particular. declarations were speaking to declarations which did or did not pass in the course of the. very transaction which these witnesses were called to prove. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11302 Iam not meaning to contend in this case, that it may not be competent for my friend to state every word that Mr. Hardy ever said in the Corresponding Society—every word that Mr. Hardy said in his correspondence with every ater society; every word that he ever said in the Constitutional Society; every word which it can be shown upon the evidence proposed had a direct connexion, or which can be properly or fairly connected with the transaction now before the Court; but what I object to is this—that you should call a witness who was not a member of any of these societies, a witness who has already told the Court that he did know but little of Mr. Hardy, that he did not even know he was an associated member of that society, any connexion with which the Friends of the People had disavowed, and that you should be permitted to ask that witness, not this question, whether in the course of any transaction connected -with the subject now before the Court, Mr. Hardy made a declaration that could be considered asa part of that transaction, but that you should ask that witness what were the declarations of Mr. Hardy at any time, when he may have scen him without connexion with the subject which is the matter of the present indictment; this will lead a great way; it is not worth while to argue upon the effect of it, for that will go another way; but I wish my learned friends to consider a little if this evidence is let in for a prisoner, it will possibly lead to let in evidence against a prisoner. I am persuaded Ido not do injustice when I say that there may be cases, I will say nothing about the present case, because I ought not; but there may be cases in which, if this sort of evidence can be let in upon principle, it may furnish a principle upon which I may be obliged to offer that evidence which, according to my present opinions about evidence, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11303 I have not thought myself at liberty to offer in this cause. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11370 If this had bea stated at first to be the question meant to askell, I do tot see what possible objectien 1 ¢guld have to it. Mr. Stuart, you bave before iad rejected oll correspondence Wit the Constititional 8d ciety 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11382 I object to it, and will state to your lordship why I do dbject to it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11395 After the petitions to parliament were rejected, your society has not met
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11451 Mr. Sheridan did, and I rather doubted whether that was from general recollection, or precise and accurate recollection. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11477  You have said that there was a remarkable readiness to have changed the prayer of the petition, if there had been time enuugh
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11479 Wad you any reason to believe (indeed I am almost ashamed to ask the question)—had you any reason to believe at the time that they waited upon you with this petition, that they had no anxiety at all about the success of it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11481 I believe that was mentioned in the letter to you
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11483 Then in effect, as it struck your mind, they appeared extremely desirous that the petition should be presented, and were extremely willing that the prayer should be altered according to your ideas, if time would have permitted 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11485 They held the language then of men desirous to have a parliamentary reform to the extent the wisdom of parliamont it them, and not to use a language which amounted to a determination to accept of nothing less than universal suffrage and annual parliaments
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11487 I dare say they did not express to you their determination that they would accept nothin from the legislature but universal suffrage an annual parliaments 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11489 I think you said they had determined to print their letter of thanks to you
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11491 You told them you totally disapproved of the method of universal suffrage and annual representation
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11493 Did you happen to know that they had published what you desired should not be published, together with a pretty strong letter preceding, which I will show you
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11495 Please to see if this is an accurate copy of the answer you sent them 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11497 Is the letter which precedes it the letter you received before you presented the petition 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11499 Have you any doubt about it

ATTORNEYGENERAL 11502 “ Sir, The Committee of Delegates of the London Corresponding Society, having perused with considerable pleasure your truly patriotic speech of the 10th instant, in favour of a radical reform in the representation of the people, think it incumbent on them, as friends to reform on that broad basis, for which you have so ably contended, toreturn you their sincerest thanks, and to express their obligations for your support of a cause, to which their every exertion has long been devoted. United as we ure upon the firmest and most patriotic principles, and with the purest of all possible intentions, the good of our country; it gives us the must heartfelt: satisfaction to see that those principles aud those intentions are pot confined to ourselves, but that there yet exists im the Units Senate a Patriot, who dares speak truth in the cause of his country, and plead for the people in the face of corruption. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11503 “ Too long has the cause of the people lay guished ; influence, interest, or prejudice have precluded knowledge from the senate; or not precluded, nearly overpowered. The people have seen with sorrow their happiness disregarded, and their rights undefended: the opposition of political warfare has been the effect of party, and the exertion of ability bsd interest for its stimulus. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11504 “ Roused from its torpor, the nation hasat last begun To THINK FOR ITsELF. Systems! communication have been formed, and me diums devised to collect the public voice— Mediums independent of influence, or comp tion: such is our society ; and from thatciety, you, Sir, are reise’ to accept the thanks of an obliged body of men, whith knows equally how to value its rights, a esteem the supporters of them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11505 We have but to wish that from exertions able, so disinterested as your’s, the cause a the people may be impartially debated in pr liament ; and we trust when that is the ay, the distinction of party will cease, ands par liamentary reform take place upon the ground of equal right. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11506 Should our hopes in this respect prove abxtive, it is impossible to say where may that spirit of Inquiry, which has gone forth among a people, who have not forgot that they are entitled to freedom, and who cannot tamely see themselves plundered of their rights—We are, Sir, with sincere respect, your highly obliged, and very humble servants, for the committee of the London Corresponding ciety.

ATTORNEYGENERAL 11509 “ With respeet to a parliamentary refer, the utmost that can be done by a few indirduals in the House of Commons, and all thst can be expected from them is, to take ev’? favourable occasion to agitate the questo and to bring the subject as often as thes a into public view and discussion. f the people of this country in genera ; were as hearty and diligent as your soul! ‘supporting the measure by declarations petitions, should have little doubt of ss cess. Without that support, success net possible. On my part, you may be sure every thing in my power shall be done ! tain it, I am, gentlemen, your mot dient, humble servant, P, Feu o the chairman and secretary of the committee of delegates ofthe London Corresponding Society. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11533 Your lordship had not heard of a letter that Skirving had written to Hardy in July, 1793, that has been read in evidence 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11535 Nor any of those other letters 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11538 That is for the jury. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11545 Before Mr. Gibbs goes on with the defence, there is a letter rom Ashton, of the 26tb of May, 1792, which 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11546 I wish to have read; it was meant to be read, but was forgotten; it is by mistake dated 1797. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11547 “ Sheffield Society for Constitutional InJormation, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11548 “Mr. Adams, Sir; Your favour of Srd ult. came duly to hand, the acceptance of our twelve friends as members of your's, is highly Satisfactory to this society, and I am directed by them ‘to request you will be pleased to present their sincere thanks to your society or their affectionate regard for, and honour couterred upon the members of this instituion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11549 t is with pleasure we congratulate you on the rapid progress of real and useful knowledge, and the dissipation of ignorance and error from among the general inass of the people. Knowledge once obtained cannot be obliterated, but by the loss, orabuse of reason: truth once fairly discovered and substantiated cannot be defaced by the sophistry and wicked designs of artful and: crafty men. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11550 “We are happy to inform you that the number of our associating, or ticket, members, keep increasing, are now about 2,400, but they have not increased of late in proportion with our worthy and respectable Trends, who (altho’ they do not associate with us as an incorporate body) have manifested themselves in a way of respectability, adding strength and support to the undertakings of this society, and to the cause in general. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11551 “ On Saturday last, 19th inst. we received a packet of printed addresses, resolves, &c. from the society (Freemasons tavern) which, on mature consideration, we find ourselves not so well reconciled to the ideas they convey to us as we could wish, if they had appeared in a different point of view, nor do they afford us such a flattering prospect as we were apprehensive might be expected from an association of so respectable a body, under the high denomination of the Friends of the People. In our opinion, their answer of 12th inst. & your ictter of 27th ult. is no ways compatible with that appellation; from the known respeetability of many names which appear amonest them, we had entertained great hopes of their teal use in obtaining a thorough reform pon the principles of the Rights of Man, which can never be accomplished, until every mas enjoys his lawful and just privileges. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11552 “ Previous to the reception of this packet, we did communicate to them, by letter, the leasing hopes it reflected to us, 00 lookieg jorward, viewing such respectable characters signalizing themselves in support of the people’s rights, agreeable to the above pra ciples, and the denomination by which they have entitled themselves, &c. In due course they would receive our letter last Thursday se’nnight, and in consequence we apprehend the packet was forwarded to us on the same day, but without any written communicatios: we shall not attempt any farther communica tion with them, until we are favoured with your sentiments upon the subject, or uott matters of doubt which we at present entertam, be, removed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11553 “We also received a packet from the Friends of the People, Southwark, and they have our hearty concurrence and best wishes; we shall in a day or two forward our reply to them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11554 “We have also becn favoured with a affectionate communication from our friends and fellow labourers at Manchester, and from several other places, who are about to form themselves into societies; Birmingham im particular claims all the assistance trom est blished societies which possibly can be administered, there are great numbers in that place friendly to the cause of the people, and we hope (notwithstanding the late tragical wracsactions) if prudent methods are adopted and pursued, the people’s attention may be turned to their own interest, and the mouths of dev pots and ranting bigots stopped, which is, and must be the sincere wish of every real friend to the peace and welfare of mankind. Iam most respectfully, your sincere friend,

ATTORNEYGENERAL 12195 On the pest rosecution, it appears to me, that I cannot tter consult the interest of the public, than to leave the execution of this uty to that discretion which presides here. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 12454 I asked Mr. Stu, upott his cross-examination, if he knew ds letter of the 26th of May, which bed ba sent to the Constitutional Society, if you wt ship has no objection, I think this wills proper place to read it in.
