GIBBS 1026 We asked to look at that book, that we might see what papers were necessary for our defence. 
GIBBS 1050 You found this yourself, I suppose
GIBBS 1052 Then you should not have answered in that manner
GIBBS 1054 What do you know about the paper
GIBBS 1184 I understand the point that Mr. Garrow contends is this, that though Mr. Hardy only is now upon trial, yet because one overt act laid in the indictment is, that papers were published, that for the purpose of proving that overt act, part of a paper deivered by Mr. Thelwall to be printed is to be given in evidence against Mr. Hardy. 
GIBBS 1192 Does your lordship think that all the directions which Mr. Thelwall gave, are to be received inevidence? 
GIBBS 1389 We can have no anxiety to fesist the evidence that is now offered, except that if it be received we know not where it imay end. The question which your lordships and the jury are now to try, is, whether Mr. Hardy has compassed the king’s death, and whether he has done any of the acts charged in the indictment as overt acts in the prosecution of that design. The evidence offered now fo your lordships to prove this, is, that Mr. Thelwall, who is charged in the indictment to have ee in the same conSpiracies that are alleged against Mr. Hardy, that Mr. Thelwall, not by any communication with Mr. Hardy, not in consequence of any peso scheme between him and Mr. 
GIBBS 1390 Hardy, did write this letter. Now with respect to any thing that passed at the meeting at which Mr. Hardy was, with t to any thing that was done by any other person directed and instructed by Mr. Hardy to do that thing, we admit that those things which passed at the society in Mr. Har . 'presence, and that any thing which twas done by another person, by the direction of Mr. Hardy, gould be evidenee against Hardy ; but to what point in the indictment the letter written by Mr. Thelwall, of which it is not proved that Mr. Hardy ever had any knowledge, is directed, I confess I cannot see. The three questions are, first, Whether Mr. Hardy compassed the king's death; second, Whether he committed any of the acts which are stated as overt acts; and, third, Whether he committed them in the prosecution of a design upon the king’s life. I take it, that a letter written by Thelwall, without the knowledge of Hardy, cannot be evidence of the act of Hardy’s mind, namely, compassing the king’s death ; therefore, it cannot be evidence tpon the first ground. 
GIBBS 1391 With respect to the existence of the acts that are laid as overt acts, they must be proved Specifically upon al] the prisoners in the indictment. The present trial is only of Mr. Hardy. The present question is, Whether he Gid any of these acts. Then the declaration of another man, whether by word of mouth or by letter, cannot prove the fact upon Mr. Hardy. 
GIBBS 1392 Then, suppose the acts proved, the third thing to be proved is, that the act was done in the prosecution of a design upon the king’s life; then, nothing that is said, written, or done by a third person, without the authority of Mr. Hardy, ean Rue that Mr. Hardy meant to produce the effect which it is imputed to him he meant to produce; namely, the destruction of the king. Therefore I submit, that this letter written by Mr. Thelwall does not appear to conduce to the proof of either of the three things imputed by this indictment; wamely, That he compassed the king’s death; that he in point of fact committed any of the acts stated in the indictment as overt acts of that design; os supposing that he committed them, that any of ihese acts were direeted to the design of compassing the king’s death. I submit, that upon neither of these grounds is this letter admissible against Mr. Hardy, and therefore ought not to be received in evidence. I wish to repeat, that it is not from any anxiety we feel with respect to this letter, but because we wish that a rule should not be established in a case upon perhaps indifferent points, as a precedent for others that may ope rate materially in the cause. ‘ 
GIBBS 1433 After this point has been so ably argued by Mr. Erskine, I can add but very little; but this I must say, that it seems to be offering this letter with an endeavour to bring: befure your lordships precisely the same question again, If I touk what your lordship said accurately, when the decision was given upon the last point, and that evidence was rejected, your lordship said, that in Dammaree’s case, and in lord George Gordon’s case, it was true, that the declarations of persons when the prisoners were not present were received in evidence; but they were received for this reason, because they had becn present at the collection of the mob, and, during the riots of those mobs, in the transactions of which it was endeavoured to implicate the prisoners : what they declared while they were in action, was admissible evidence, to show what the object of these insurrections was, and therefore it was re ceived: but your lordships have never determined, tbat that which was declared by a pergon unconnected with the prisoner at the bar, except as he may, at particular occasions, have been brought into his company, could in any case be received as evidence. 
GIBBS 1434 i understand the line to be this: when a fman is indicted for that which is done by a great collection of men assembled together, and he is present at some times and absent at others, the declarations of other men acting with him in that very act for which he is indicted, are admissible evidence to show what the object of that assembly was: But why was the letter last offered, rejected? For this reason, because it contained a relation of facts, of which relation of facts the prisoner was not cognizant: he did not know that these facts were so related: What is the present letter? I asked to see it before I addressed your lordships: I was told I must not sec it, that it was irregular; from what I have collected of it, it is no more than the last letter: it contains a relation of facts, and then they would add to it, that the object of this relation of facts, was to keep up the spirits of a person at Edinburgh; ifunderstood the argument, that was the drift of it. 
GIBBS 1436 Certainly ; I am arguing under great difficulties; my object was, to show at this is the same question which your 
GIBBS 1437 Lordships have decided upon the former argument; I desired to see the letter before I addressed my argument to your lordships, which may certainly be all mere air, if I am mistaken in the fact; I was told in point of regularity, I could notseethe letter, and therefore I can only argue it upon the recoliection of what was loosely stated: it might be sc intended, in the mind of the writer of it, to keep up the spirits of Mr. Margarot : But was that object communicated to the prisoner? Did he mean that those facts should be so related? The real object for producing this letter, is this—that the representation of facts contained in that letter, b the writer of it (and in the writing of which fetter the prisoner is not in any respect implicated), that the narration of facts by the writer of the letter, should be fixed upon the peisoners that whatever the writer of that letter has improvidently, foolishly, rashly, or I will say unlawfully expressed in that letter that rashness, folly, or illegality, may be fixed upon Mr. Hardy. It seems to me, that this case comes directly within the spirit of your lordships decision upon the last argument. 
GIBBS 1438 Cases were stated upon the last argument, in which the declarations of third persons were received against a prisoner; but it was only in cases where the prisoner was indicted for joining in the act of a multitude, where persons are sometimes present and sometimes abpent; a part of that multitude, at the time they were unlawfully collected, for which unlawful collection the prisoner was among others indicted; part of them had deel what was their object. I agree that may be evidence against a prisoner, and he must exculpate himself if he can; but that a letter shauld be evidence against Mr. Hardy, which he never saw, and for a purpose to which he never acceded, seems to me against all law, and I am sure that it is against all justice ; for the object of this indictment is to try the mind of Mr. Hardy—to try whether he did in his mind compass the death of the king. And surely, justice docs not require that that which is proved to pass in the mind of one man ahauld fix a similarity of sentiment in the mind of another, who neither directed the letter to be written which is offered in evidence, nor ever afterwards knew that the letter was written, which letter too never was received. 
GIBBS 1440 I beg your pardon, I would not have you take my argument improperly ; I did not say conspirators in action, but I said that where a number of men are indicted for acts of violence in which they unite, and the prisoner is sometimes present and sometimes absent, that what is stated by some of those persons who are said to co-operate with him in some of those acts of violence may be evidence. 
GIBBS 2832 Do you think that is evidence? I do not mean to moot the question, 
GIBBS 3946  You said, about the time these pikes were talked about, there had been a mischievous band-bill circulated, for the purpose, as you Suppose, of exciting the people against the Society ; can you tell me what was the general substance of it
GIBBS 3948 But what was the general substance of it
GIBBS 3950 That was the first thing that was published ; at what time was it published? before or after this meeting that you speak of
GIBBS 3952 But you say the object of it was to provoke the people 
GIBBS 3954 people meant the society 
GIBBS 3956 ‘The cry was, they could never do any thing with yous unless they caused a riot against ou, they could make nothing of ite—it has been said so, but I cannot recollect who said At; but this wicked hand-bill appearing, without the sanction of the law, or the magistrate, —Ireadit; and, if I had been aware of this, I would have brought it; this was the cause of any thing being spoken concerning arms, 
GIBBS 3957 Among all the conversation you have ever heard upon the subject of these pikes, were they intended for the purpose of making an attack upon any power in this country, or onl. for defending yourselves, if you should be attacked
GIBBS 3959 Whether you ever collected, from those who talked of pikes, or ever produced any, that they meant to make any attack upon any of the powers in this country, or only to defend theinselves, if they were illegally attacked 
GIBBS 3961 Then they were meant only to be used ow the defensive 
GIBBS 3963 Had any of the people in this society to which you belonged, any idea of making any attack upon either the King, or the House of Lords? had they any idea of altering the government in that respect 
GIBBS 3965 Had you, as one of that socicty, any such intention yourself
GIBBS 3967 But to speak plain; by that you mean, I suppose, that you never had any such thought in your mind
GIBBS 3969 Was not the object of your meeting a parliamentary reform 
GIBBS 3971 Who were the members of the Friends of the People 
GIBBS 3973 Mr. Stuart, I believe was the secretary 
GIBBS 3975 Should you have continued a member of this society, ifyou had thoughtthat they had any intent of shaking either the king, or the lords, or of displacing the king from his throne
GIBBS 3977 You would not 
GIBBS 3979 Should you not have abhorred such en idea 
GIBBS 3981 Have you any reason, from any thing that ever passed in the society, to believe there was a single member of it who entertained such a notion
GIBBS 3983 The object of your meeting, you say, was to state to the people the grounds of certain evils which you thought to exist; and wished to bring about a parliamentary refurm. Ws that a parliamentary reform in the House of Commons
GIBBS 3985 You meant that the king and the lords should remain as they were ; but that there should be a reform in the House of Commons? woe Yes. 
GIBBS 3986 Did you believe, and was that the ground upon which you acted, that by producing such reform as you wished in the House of Commons, that those evils would be remedied 
GIBBS 3988 ‘Then do I understand you right, when I suppose this to have been your principle— that you thought the King, and the Lords, with the House of Commons, so reformed, would redress all your grievances 
GIBBS 3990 Was it your object to attain this end peaceably 
GIBBS 3992 T speak of your own particular object— Your object was to attain it peaceably 
GIBBS 3994 Have you any reason to think it was the object of any other man in the society, to use any but peaceable means to obtain it 
GIBBS 3996 Repeat that answer
GIBBS 3998 When that mecting was had, to be sure no moan can answer for the acts of those who should compose it, certainly not ; but had you any reason to suppose, that those whom you should send to that meeting would act otherwise than peaceably ? would youhavesent any who you did not think would have acted peaceably 
GIBBS 4000 And you have no reason to think that others would have acted otherwise than peaceably ? No;Ihave no reason to think so whatever, 
GIBBS 4001 When national representation was talked of by Mr. Yorke at this meeting, by national representation, was jt not meant the representation of the people of England in the House of Commons 
GIBBS 4774 I object to this—I understand the Court has determined that any thing that any member of the Corresponding Society says, is evidence against Mr. Hardy: but I do bot apprehend that the Ceurt has determined that every thing said by the members of the Lambeth Association, whom the witness does not know to be members of the Corresponding Society is evidence; consequently the question put, of what this man has heard from any member of the Lambeth Association, um ee oon Sex tte he Beare sca some of se who compose Fre} ing Soci insceenaeice, aiid 
GIBBS 4787 He did so: but I do not apprehend that if any gentleman who wears a particular uniform had appeared up stairs at dinner with your lordships to-day, that your lordships would be affected by any thing which a member of the society, to which that gentleman belonged had said. I might put the case of some gentlemen who did dine with your lordships, who are engaged in societies that wear uniforms: suppose one of those gentlemen had happened to dine with your lordships up stairs in that uniform, by the argument the solicitor general uses, because he appeared in his uniform, at dinner with your lordships, therefore, what any one said who belonged to the society, distinguished by that uniform would be evidence against all those who h dined with that gentleman. It seems to me that is an argument which cannot stand for a moment 
GIBBS 4788 Another way in which it has been put by my learned friend, Mr. Bower, is thise—That because Mr. Franklow being a member of the London ‘Corresponding Society, presided at another society, fur a purpose that is not connected with the London Corresponding Society therefore, first his declarations are evidence against Hardy, because he is one of those sands of whom the London Corresponding Society consists; and next, if he constitutes another society consisting of ten thousand men, every thing, that every one of those ten thousand men, who are constituted by one man that belongs to the two or three thousand of which the London Corresponding Society consists, is to be evidence against Mr. Hardy. It does not seem to me that there is any principle of law upon which any of those men who happened to belong to a society, instituted by Franklow, he happening to be a member of the society of which Hardy was a member, that the declarations of any one of those men so sub-connected with the society, no, not even upon oath, can be evidence against Hardy, to prove either that he has compassed the king’s death, or done any of the acts stated in this indictment, or that those acts were. pointed to that design sgainet the king’s life. Perhaps, I am less distinct in arguing the case before your lordship, because, I confess, I do not feel any principle upon which this can be contended to be evidence. 
GIBBS 4793 I could understand how Franklow’s declarations were evidence, but the point that puzzled me was, I could not understand how the declarations of those men who were only concerned with Franklow in his association, could be evidence, because it seems to me upon the same principle that the declarations of people sub-employed by them, and of others sub-employed by them, and so oa, would be evidence. 
GIBBS 4813 It seems to me that it is not open to Mr. Bower to fix the prisoner with what the witness may fancy he has collected froma conversations that he has heard at this society, without mentioning who those persons were from whom he heard it: for how am I to contradict it? 
GIBBS 5680  Who was with you, when you found these papers 
GIBBS 5682 Who desired you to go
GIBBS 5684 When did you find them 
GIBBS 5686 I submit to your lordship, that, according to the rule iad down yesterday, the song is not evidence, being found after Mr. Hardy was taken up. 
GIBBS 5688 I wish it had; but I did not know it till I came to the cross-examination of the witness. 
GIBBS 5690 How do T Tide that this was jot: printed after the apprehension of Mr. 
GIBBS 5691 ly? 
GIBBS 5694 I only wish to have lordship’s opinion ; I do not mean to take up the time of the Court; it seems to me, that there is certainly the same objection to this paper, as to those which were offered before, of whatever date fey may be, unless they can prove, either that they were in the possession of the prisoner, or of some member of the London Corresponding Society, before he was apprehended, or that he put that date to them; the circumstance and bearing of the date certainly is not evidence: 
GIBBS 5696 Prove they existed in thesession of some member of the London Corresponding Society. 
GIBBS 5722 We do not mind what you always understood; relate what any body said. 
GIBBS 5727 Does your lordship think that this sort of examination ought to go on without mentioning the name of any person from whom it came? it is, your lordship sees, utterly impossible for us to have an opportunity of contradicting this kind of evidence. 
GIBBS 6122  Pray what are you
GIBBS 6124 Then you are a lawyer 
GIBBS 6126 Is conveyancing the only branch. of the profession that you have followed ? 
GIBBS 6127 Mr. Groves
GIBBS 6129 Are you an attorney 
GIBBS 6131 You may tell me whether you are an attorney or not
GIBBS 6133 Are you a solicitor. 
GIBBS 6134 Mr. Groves
GIBBS 6136 No,I did not mean in Chancery, you have been long enough in the law to know the meaning: of the word solicitor, are you a solicitor of any sort
GIBBS 6138 Where 
GIBBS 6140 Why then, you are solicitor at the Old Bailey 
GIBBS 6142 Could not you have said so at once; you understood perfectly well what I meant
GIBBS 6144 When I asked if you were a solicitor, and you asked if I meant in Chancery, I told you T did not mean in Chancery 
GIBBS 6146 And you really did not know the meaning of my question
GIBBS 6148 You had not the least idea that I meant to ask, if you had been an Old Bailey solicitor? It ne net occur to me. 
GIBBS 6149 Tt did not occur to you, upon my ag ou the question, that you had been an Ol Bailey solicitor 
GIBBS 6151 You really did not know but that I means to ask you whether you were a solicitor in Chancery 
GIBBS 6153 How came you to go then
GIBBS 6155 y whom ? 
GIBBS 6156 Mr. Groves
GIBBS 6158 Ifit be improper I will not askings but in the character of a spy 
GIBBS 6160 Mr. Groves
GIBBS 6168 Then where is the delicacy of at 
GIBBS 6170 I will not press the question farther than your lordship thinks I ought--T leave it to the discretion of the Court if it is thought not proper. 
GIBBS 6172 Then you were desired by a rson, high in office, to go to this place, how arose your connexion with that gentleman 
GIBBS 6174 What sort of connexion had you with him? 
GIBBS 6178 I dare say you would not. 
GIBBS 6182 Then trusting in you, he sent you to the Globe-tavern on the 20th of January, 1794 
GIBBS 6184 Then you never were at any of those meetcall it so, I will take it so. 
GIBBS 6185 If you were not there as a spy, take any title vou choose for yourself, and I will give you that. 
GIBBS 6187 I did not desire you to take any title in the sense that gentleman is using the term ; you object to the term spy, as I called you, and I bid you take any other naine. 
GIBBS 6189 I really did not feel that I was going atall out of the way in the cross-examination of a witness, in walling him by a name which suits his character, though he does not like it. 
GIBBS 6191 You went then (not to call you a spy) to these meetings in the character of a person who had nootherreason for going there, than that of picking up what information you could, and carrying it again to those employers, in whose conhilesiee you were 
GIBBS 6193 Then I must express your employment hy that periphrasis. You said there was a greut assembly there 
GIBBS 6195 There wasa considerable meeting you said, and universal suffrage and annual parliaments were talked of ? 
GIBBS 6196 Pt —Which meeting do you speak of? 
GIBBS 6197 I am speaking of the meeting to which you first went —There was a very large meeting, so much so that the floor broke down. 
GIBBS 6198 You have been giving an account of some conversation that passed there; cannot you recollect who the persons were that had that conversation
GIBBS 6200 You going there for the purpose of collecting evidence against individuals, and coming now to give evidence againstan individual, vou thought it not material to observe who the people were who then used this language— You, a gentleman used to practise at the Old Bailey, and meaning to give evidence afterwards against those persons, did not think it material to learn by whom these cunversations were held? 
GIBBS 6203 Send to Mr. Erskine, he is in the parlour. 
GIBBS 6205 I desired Mr. Erskine to be sent for into court, as I wished to have the testimony of a gentleman who has practised in that court more than any man now present, that I was not departing from the practice which has obtained there, My end is now answered in desiring Mr. Erskine to come into court. 
GIBBS 6212 My reason for sending for Mr. Erskine was because I knew it had been the practice, and I think I have observed it m the course of this cause on the other side. What Mr. Justice Buller has said, that it isa Practice that has gene on toa greater length than it ought, I hope, will be an excuse tor me, because I am more inexperienced in the profession than Mr. Erskine or Mr. Garrow. If that mode of examination prevails on one side, especially against a defendant. 
GIBBS 6214 Your lordship does not suI trust, than I sent for Mr. Erskine with any other view than I have mentioned, I coafess I feel myself sensibly mortified. 
GIBBS 6215 Lord Chief justice Eyre
GIBBS 6217 I think you told me thet you were a gentleman who practised at the Ud Bailey, 3 you now practise here, or have you lett off that practice 
GIBBS 6219 You now practise at the Old Bailey
GIBBS 6221 How happens that 
GIBBS 6223 Your reason for not having practised is, that no business has been brought to you, I presume 
GIBBS 6225 Did you or not think it necessary, at Meeting, to attend to the particular persoms from whom the conversation that you are now stating, proceeded 
GIBBS 6227 You did not endeavour to distinguish what was said by one man from what was said by ancther
GIBBS 6229 You say the language was universal sufand anoual parliaments 
GIBBS 6231 Who used it you cannot tell
GIBBS 6233 Tlow many people might there be there 
GIBBS 6235 You cannot recollect any one particular person who held this language you have been speakiug of 
GIBBS 6237 You were afterwards at Chalk-farm, I think you say 
GIBBS 6239 Tbere you went under the same employment, and for the same person 
GIBBS 6241 You seem to have fixed yourselfa good deal upon Mr. Thelwall 
GIBBS 6243 It was involuntary then
GIBBS 6245 You would rather have declined it !— No, I did not say that; that is going too far; he and I were standing at the door, in Storestreet, together, when there were not above ten or a dozen people there, and then the paper being stuck up, that the meeting would held at Chalk Farm, he said, “ come eng. 
GIBBS 6246 Was that the first time you had conversed with him
GIBBS 6248 Did he know who you were 
GIBBS 6250 He had no previous knowledge of you 
GIBBS 6252 Had ‘ae any introduction to him 
GIBBS 6254 You had yo previous knowledge of him, nor he of you, no introduction to him, no common friend who told each that he might trust the other 
GIBBS 6256 But all this that he said to you was voluntary
GIBBS 6258 I think you say that at Chalk-farm there was aclamour that spies were there 
GIBBS 6260 snd, I believe, I may add something further, now you have brought it tg my, recollection : 
GIBBS 6261 hesaid, it would give the minister the power of te ging of their proceedings and their num13, 
GIBBS 6262 You said so before. I believe you yourself made this cry against spies, did not you? you said you thought there were spies 
GIBBS 6263 Smong them
GIBBS 6265 Yes, yes, that was a scheme you had learned in your practice certainly; you were the person then who suggested that there were spics from the Treasury there 
GIBBS 6267 Did you say you knew him to be a spy
GIBBS 6269 Who was he
GIBBS 6271 And you seeing Mr. Walsh there, said, you thought he was a person employed by governiment
GIBBS 6273 Because Mr. Walsh came there with King and Constitution upon his buttons, you chose to say that you thought he was a spy, was that so
GIBBS 6275 Well, seeing him there with King and Constitution on his buttons, you chose to say that you thought he was a spy from the Treasury 
GIBBS 6277 Then do tell me how the fact is
GIBBS 6279 Did not you me hiey believed he was a spy
GIBBS 6281 Will you swear you did not say, that you believed he was a spy
GIBBS 6283 Then you do consider that the term spy, is to be applied to those employed by government
GIBBS 6285 No; itis your own interpretation of the words 
GIBBS 6287 Then you did say you thought he was a spy 
GIBBS 6289 tt wasafter that, that Mr. Thelwall said he was for admitting all spies 
GIBBS 6291 This was a very large mceting, was not it
GIBBS 6293 Had you no apprehension for your friend, Mr. Walsh, saying, you thought he was a spy, at such a mecting 
GIBBS 6295 He was nota man, I suppose, whom you wished to have torn to picccs 
GIBBS 6297 Were not you a little apprehensive of holding him out asa spy, a man youknew nothing ot
GIBBS 6299 But though you might be for letting spies, that were there, continue, I want to know why you pointed out a particular man as a spy 
GIBBS 6301 Did not you say you believed he was employed by government 
GIBBS 6303 Employed by government to be there
GIBBS 6305 But was not that your meaning
GIBBS 6307 Then why are you fencing with me
GIBBS 6309 You represented him to be a man sent there by government, in the same way as yourself
GIBBS 6311 What induced you to point out this man
GIBBS 6313 Did you believe him tobe so 
GIBBS 6315 I want to know whether you, going there, as what you call yourself, a spy, how you came to point out to the people, that were there, another person whom you also believed to be a spy
GIBBS 6317 With King and Constitution upon his buttons 
GIBBS 6319 What number of people do you think were there at this time 
GIBBS 6321 You say, that sitting down to eat some bread and cheese, there was something that you called little instruments taken out, and it turned out that these were French knives 
GIBBS 6323 I know they are very common things 
GIBBS 6325 You went to Mr. Green’s in Orange-street, you say 
GIBBS 6327 He told you he had sold two or three hundred of these, but told you to speak very low as the parlour-door was open, and his wife was a damned Aristocrat 
GIBBS 6329 You are positive to those particular words, that he said his wife was a damned Aristocrat
GIBBS 6331 What did you laugh at
GIBBS 6333 I think you told me you were at the dinner on ie 2d of May, at the Crown and Anchor? —165. 
GIBBS 6334 How many people might there be there
GIBBS 6336 You went there in the same character, I suppose 
GIBBS 6338 You say there was some piece of news brought, a newspaper brought in 
GIBBS 6340 You do not know whether there was any newspaper brought in
GIBBS 6342 Then at this meeting that you are speaking of, there were a number of very respectable gentlemen 
GIBBS 6344 How did you get there
GIBBS 6346 What number did this meeting consist of
GIBBS 6348 You are not sure, I think you say, who was in the chair 
GIBBS 6350 You must not presume to think 
GIBBS 6352 Whichever it was, I suppose he sat at the head of the table
GIBBS 6354 Then I think you say Mr. Tooke madea speech, in which he reflected upon the House of Commons 
GIBBS 6356 You say he called the House of Commons a sink of corruption 
GIBBS 6358 He spoke of there being a junction between the two parties 
GIBBS 6360 I do not want you to repeat any offensive expressions that he used against individuals, but I think in speaking against the hereditary nobility, he spoke generally of a particular person 
GIBBS 6362 I believe he spoke highly of the hereditary nobility of the country 
GIBBS 6364 He spoke highly of the hereditary nobility of the country as contra-distinguished from adventurers
GIBBS 6366 I believe he observed, likewise, that this hereditary nobility, of whom he spoke so high, had lost their influence in the state, by the introduction of adventurers
GIBBS 6368 By the introduction of those then who were not the hereditary nobility? —The new nobility. 
GIBBS 6369 He had before been declaiming against the House of Commons, certainly, using an imProper expression, however, calling them a sink of corruption 
GIBBS 6371 Did he not say, likewise, that those new nobility were introduced into the House of Lords by means of those people whose conduct he was finding fault with in the House of Commons 
GIBBS 6373 Did he not also speak highly of the office of the King in the Constitution 
GIBBS 6375 Did he not mention it as matter of complaint, that the king had lost his due weight In the constitution, by means of this corruption that he had been complaining of before 
GIBBS 6377 Did he hold out any thing as matter of complaint in the now existing constitution, except that there was a sort of people introduced into the House of Commons whom he disapproved of; and by their means likewise asort of persons introduced into the House of Peers, whom he disapproved of; and that they, acting together, restrained the due power of the crown 
GIBBS 6379 Mr. John Gurnell called again. 
GIBBS 6380 Where did you find that paper

GIBBS 6994 Let us understand that you have no memorandum of this 
GIBBS 7041 Have not you some notes you have gone through 
GIBBS 7043 I desire to look at them? 
GIBBS 7044 The Witness delivers them to Mr. Gibbs, saying,—I presume you will give them me again. 
GIBBS 7045 What reason have you, sir, to suppose that I will not give them to you apes Te you mix them, it may be impossible for me to arrange them again. 
GIBBS 7046 You have given me these papers, mark them 1, 2, 3, 4. 
GIBBS 7131 this was a meeting, not composed wholly of the members of the Corresponding Society. 
GIBBS 7133 But he is speaking of conversation that passed from people there, whom jhe cannot name. 
GIBBS 7275 I think he said before that, “ I consulted with a friend who recommended it to me. 
GIBBS 7289 I submit to your lordships whether this is not the distinction: That where an informer in the Exchequer proceeds upon an information of facts—communicated by another person, that he should not be called upon to disclose the person giving him the information: But it is perfectly new to me, I confess. I have no doubt it is my ignorance, I mean blameable ignorance, because I ought to be better informed in my profession; bat I never have met with an inStance in which it has been objected to asking a witness, upon cross-examination, who the person was to whom he communicated a fact that he states, because it happens that the person to whom he did communicate that fact, did advise him to communicate it farther to a magistrate. I know it is established in the court, in which your lordship long presided, that where an informer has communicated facts to a person, and that person has acted upon the communication of those facts, they cannot ask who brought those facts to his kyowledge ; but ;" you ask a witness whether he has communicated it to any other rson, and he tells you he has, whose name e does not mention, because he says that person advised him to communicate it toa 
GIBBS 7290 Magistrate. I think it never has been held, in a court of justice, that that was an objection to the question. 
GIBBS 7891 I submit to your lordship that that is improper. That sort of interlarding a a question is not permitted to us even in crossexamination. 
GIBBS 7972 I submit to your lordship that that is improper. That sort of interlarding a a question is not permitted to us even in crossexamination. 
GIBBS 7988 The convention never had petitioned parliament. 
GIBBS 7990  Mr. Garrow states that the object was to petition again that parliament which the convention had before petitioned without effect—Now I am not aware that the convention had petitioned parliament. 
GIBBS 8287 With respect to that expedient T have no douht to say, that it is utterly impossible for Mr. Erskine and myself, in the situation in which we are, respecting uurselves, respecting the Court, and respecting the public, pe the jury, it is utterly impossible for us to think of that, because if any thing adverse should happen when we have taken such a line, the imputation will lie upon us. 
GIBBS 8291 We conceive your lordships will permit Mr. Erskine to open the case of Mr. any: then our witnesses will be examined, and then I shall be heard after ous witnesses, 
GIBBS 8299 Your lordship secs that the evidence offered is that these papers, after the apprehension of Mr. Hardy, were found in the possession of Mr. Martin and Mr. Thelwall, merely that they. were in their possession, not that they were ever used by them, it does not appear but that they might have got into their possession again, but simply that they were in their custody as a newspaper is in my hand this morning, and may pass inte other hands. 
GIBBS 8301 I understand the rule generally to go to any paper that was in the hands of any one daa I understand that to be the principle. 
GIBBS 8307 Look at that paper
GIBBS 8309 When did you find it
GIBBS 8317 Did you ever see Mr. Martin write
GIBBS 8319 You did live in the Adelphi, I believe 
GIBBS 8345 How do you know that
GIBBS 8355  What are you
GIBBS 8357  Were you in the King’s-bench prison for debt 
GIBBS 8359 For two years I think you say 
GIBBS 8361 Had you any difference with Mr. Martin there
GIBBS 8363 I do not want to know the reason of your difference, you had a violent quarrel 
GIBBS 8365 You never uttered any expressions of resentment or threats against him, did you
GIBBS 8394 Your lordskips see this is not evidence against Mr. Hardy; in fact, it is not the more evidence for Hardy's name being mentioned, than if it was not mentioned. 5 
GIBBS 8396  What resolutions were those that Mr. Martin spoke of
GIBBS 8400 Can you swear that these are the very papers that you saw in Mr. Martin's hand 
GIBBS 8402 Were they ever put into your hand to read
GIBBS 8404 Since 
GIBBS 8406 You have frequently read them 
GIBBS 8408 You amused yourself with looking into Mr. Martin's papers when he was not there
GIBBS 8410 When you speak of the copies that Pearce said had been give among the Coach-makers, do you mean to say that they were copies of these papers
GIBBS 8412 But you do not mean that they were copies of those which are now put into court? 
GIBBS 8414 I know it is not, but I thought that mistake might arise. 
GIBBS 8470 Does your lordship think that without producing the paper itself, which was handed round, they can give in evidence a paper similar to it? 
GIBBS 8484 Does your lotdship think that this, which was all after the apprehension of the prisoner, is evidence? 
GIBBS 8490  It seems to me that upon the principle your lordships have laid down, that nothing which happened after the apprehension of the prisoner can be evidence against him; this evidence ought to be excluded: whether the evidence they have iven, previous to the apprehension, answers e purpose they wish, ts another thing; but some pikes having been ordered by Orrock, or Watt, before the apprehension of Mr. Hardy, does not make the finding of these pikes, after the apprehension df Hardy, evidence, any more than if no order whatever had been given for them previously: if the former evidence is not complete for the purpose for which they want it, [cannot conceive upon what principle the pikes being found in the possession of this man, after Mr. Hardy’s apprehension, is rendered evidence, by a circumstance which happened before it ; itwould not have been evidence supposing that communication had not taken place. 
GIBBS 8492 Your lordship sees, in arguin, this, that do not mean to admit that the order was Mr. Hardy’s, or any thing like it. 
GIBBS 8839  You were a member, I belicve, of the London Corresponding Society 
GIBBS 8841 Were you of the same division with the prisoner, Mr. Hardy 
GIBBS 8843 Did you attend the divisions much 
GIBBS 8845 Is it two years that you have ceased to belong to it
GIBBS 8847 You saw Mr. Hardy frequently
GIBBS 8849 Were youacquainted with him 
GIBBS 8851 What was his character—a man of a peaceable disposition, or at all inclined to riot or tumult
GIBBS 8853 Was he a friend to order 
GIBBS 8855 Then he was a great friend to peace and order 
GIBBS 8857 What were the objects of your society 
GIBBS 8859 In what House of parliament did you wish that reform to take place 
GIBBS 8862 I understand so. 
GIBBS 8864 We think that every witness that we shall call, will submit to'any crose-examination the crown may choose. 
GIBBS 8866 You will understand, that it will not be an excuse to you, with respect to any question that the attorney general may ask, that an answer will accuse yourself
GIBBS 8869 Youhave said, that the only object of your society was a reform in the House of Commons 
GIBBS 8871 Was it any part of your views to make any alteration in the House of Lords 
GIBBS 8873 Had you ever any design to make any attack, or to trench at all upon the authority of the crown 
GIBBS 8875 You had not 
GIBBS 8879 I understand, and I take the rule from the Court, that a counsel must not putea answer into the mouth of a witness, ie ay laa him to the subject. a asked if they any views loa changein House of Lords. 
GIBBS 8881 I will putit so. You said you did wish that there should be a reform in the House of Commons; what were the views of the society with respect to the House of Lords
GIBBS 8883 What were the views of the society with respect to the authority of the Crown 
GIBBS 8885 You told me you were intimately acquainted with Mr. Hardy, did he converse with you often upon political subjects 
GIBBS 8887 If he had had any views different from a do you think you should have known 
GIBBS 8889 Had you any reason, from any conversation that you ever had with him, to think that his views were different from yours; that be had any views either upon the House of Lords er the King 
GIBBS 8902 I believe I had better go on with the examination. You tell me you never collected, from Mr. Hardy, that he had any different views from those that you had 
GIBBS 8904 Did Mr. Hardy ever produce, at the division meeting of your society, any letter, that he received from Sheffield, about pikes
GIBBS 8906 Did he ever communicate it to you
GIBBS 8913 I asked, in the examination in chief, whether the letter, relating to pikes, had been read; I putin those terms; I do aver, upon my veracity, that did; and I will not have that contradicted. 
GIBBS 8917 Because there was a direct contradiction to the fact.

GIBBS 9105 Had you any idea of opposing the government by force 
GIBBS 9107 Had you any intention of doing that? — 
GIBBS 9108 “None.

GIBBS 9295 Then your intention was only to work a reformation in the House of Commons 
GIBBS 9297 Had you any reason to think that any other members of the society intended any thing else
GIBBS 9299 Was it the intention of any member of the society to bring this about by force
GIBBS 9301 Would you have continued in the society, if you had found they had any such intentions

GIBBS 9439 Was he represented to you as an object in distress 
GIBBS 9441 And for that man so imprisoned, and so in distress, did you subscribe any money 
GIBBS 9443 What was your reason for saying, just now, that you perhaps subscribed a guinea, or two guineas, or five guineas

GIBBS 9724 I ask this in order to sift the mind of the prisoner; the crime imputed to the prisoner is an act of the mind; this case is an anomalous one—the compassingin his own mind the king’s death ; I am asking as to the conversations he has had upon the subject, in order to find what were his intentions, what the state of his mind was upon that subject.

GIBBS 10024 From the year 1780, to the present time, what character has he borne
GIBBS 10026 Has that been his general character
GIBBS 10028 And from what you have heard of him
GIBBS 11279 I submit to your ar og that this evidence is admissible. My leame friend has exhausted all the law that an out of the ‘case, and therefore it will not be necessary for me to trouble your lordsbups upon that part of the case; but it seems to me upon a plain principle in a case of sort, the declaration of the prisoner explaizing the overt-act, the tendency of which over act is the point for the jury to determine toust be admissible evidence. 
GIBBS 11280 Your lordships will find it is laid down 0 lord Hale—I believe it is laid down io muy cases, that an overt-act, indifferent is 4 nature, may yet be explained to be an ovettact committed, tending to the purpose cor ceived by the prisoner of destroying the king; for instance, theact ch upon Crobagal, the coming into England was in itself a0 different act, which became an overt-act compassing the king's death, because te intent of bis coming into England was & plained by words spoken elsewhere; ands many other cases I take it that words spoken by a man, not only at the time of the overt act, but before that time, are admissible, for tere is no limitation of time within which words spoken by a prisoner may not be given in eidence to explain the nature of an overt act, charged to be an overt act in the prosecution of his design of compassing the king's death 
GIBBS 11281 Now if the crown may give evidence of the whole of a man's life, for the purpse of explaining an indifferent act, and giving it a crimial complexion, surely it follows, upon the principle of administering equal justice, that whatever he has said upon the same subject, tending to prove a differnt intention, an innocent intention, it should be copetent to him to give in evidence. I take the distinction to be this: if that which is charged upon a man to be an act, if it be a thing done, you cannot in any case give in evidence that the prisoner has denied that he did the thing. The crown in that case may give evidence, that the prisoner did at any time admit that he committed the act, that he did the thing, the prisoner cannot answer that, by showing that at another time he said he had not done it, though you may ask whether he had not held some other conversation which explained 
GIBBS 11282 ; the tendency of that. We have it not in question now, whether he did commit the overt-act stated in theindictment, but whether 
GIBBS 11283 In committing the act, he had, or not, the original design 
GIBBS 11285 The design is a part of the overt-act in this way—the overt-act of comthe calling together a convention for the purpose of deposing the king; it states first the treason ; the treason laid is that he compassed the king’s death, and then the overt-act is laid thus—that he, with others, for the purpose of accomplishing the treason, did conspire with others to call this convention, in order that this convention might depose the king. 
GIBBS 11286 The distinction that I was taking is this— I know that we have before the jury both the fact and the design as to deposing the king; namely, the fact of consenting to hold a convention, and the design with which it was consented to be held; but we are now about to show what the design was, to exculpate the prisoner trom any criminal intention. I admit we could not go into evidence of what the prisoner had said at any time of his life, for the purpose of showing he had not consented to hoid this convention, because that is a fact ; butIsubmit with great deference to your lordship, that in order to show that that convention was consented to be held, not with the design which the crown imputes, but with an mrocent design, we may go into evidence of what the prisoner has at other times declared, inasmuch as the crown has gone into ull that which the prisoner at apy part of his life has declared touching this fact; and not only that, butinto evidence of what any member in the London Corresponding Society, any member of the Constitutional Society, or an member of any societies corresponding with those societies have said. As the crown is permitted to go into evidence of what any one of those people have said, in order to prove that the ultimate design was to depose the king, we only ask in answer to that, that we may be permitted to go into declarations of the prisoner of that which can be only found in his own mind; not that he did not do the act imputed to him, but that the design with which he did that act, was different from that which the crown imputes. I was going to put a case which I had forgot in the course of the argument, which appears to me not unlike this, and which was suggested by your lordship’s saying that the design of deposing the king is a part of the overt act—the case of murder; suppose it plainly proved that the prisoner did kill the deceased, and the question is whether it is murder or manslaughter, that will turn upon the intent. I take it in that case it is the constant, uniform practice to receive evidence ef the declarations of the prisoner of his -will and friendship to the deceased. —Now, why are these declarations received ; Iam sure I have heard, in innumerable instances, evidence given of declarations of prisoners of good-will to the deceased, when they have admitted they gave the fatal blow, and when the question is, what is the quality of the act committed, whether murder or manslaughter ; and the rule, I take it, is not confined to declarations immediately upon committing the act, but to declarations at former times. Why are these declarations received; the act of giving the blow is admitted. So here the calling a convention is admitted, the declarations are received for this purpose, to show what the mind of the man was, what his intent must have been, whether he gave the blow with a view to produce death or not. Then with what view do we offer this evidence? to show his design, whether it was the design the attorney general imputes, or an innocent one. We offer this evidence in order to show that the object of this convention was different from that which the attorney general states, in the same way as the evidence of good-will to the deceased is admitted, in a case where the question is, whether the crime is murder or manslaughter. 
GIBBS 11380 We offer this as evidence of the fact, that there did exist meetings m Scotland which had the name of a convention of delegates, at the time Mr. Erskine has stated. 
GIBBS 11385  Where do you live 
GIBBS 11387 Are you a member of the society there
GIBBS 11389 What are the objects of that society 
GIBBS 11391 Had you any view with respect to the other branches of the legislature, either to the King, or the Lords 
GIBBS 11393 Had you, or had any of the members of your society, to your knowledge, any intent to bring about that reform by force 
GIBBS 11558 May it please your Lordships; Gentlemen of the jury; I need not state tot you the anxiety that I must necessarily feeltreason; and you are bound to inquire of upon this occasion, oppressed by the weightnothing that is not there charged. ofa cause under which the mighty abilities ofmy learned friend could hardly support him. 1 But, gentlemen, if Ican, I will do my duty to that miserable man at the bars if my strength 1! enables me to go through the defence which 1 I bave undertaken, I will defend him; it is 1 not a wish to spare my own strength, it is nota wish to spare my own health which hasoverpowered me, but it is because I have felt this cause too great for me; I have felt myself incapable of comprehending, in my mind, the vast mass of evidence which the crown has ; produced against this man. No time which the indulgence of the Court has allowed me, 1 Do industry of my own (in which, I assure you, I have not failed) has enabled me so to conceive, in my mind, this vast cause, as to State it intelligibly to you; for so, and so only does the interest of the prisoner, and public Justice, require that it should be stated. Gentlemen, you will remember that, in the outset, it took the attorney gencral nine hours Merely to open this case; a length of speech unheard of; the annals of this kingdom do Rot afford an instance of a prosecution founded en so many complicated facts, drawn out of such a tangled web, that less than a speech of nine hours could not render it intelligible to the jury, nor explain to them by what mode of reasoning it was meant to bring the imputed charge home to the prisoner. 
GIBBS 11559 To suppose that the attorney general has stated his case at greater length, or burthened it with more evidence than in his judgment was necessary, would be casting an unworthy reflection on him. His known character renders it impossible. ‘The prosecution itself must be thought to have required for its support this mass of evidence, which it is our duty, as counsel for the prisoner, to observe upon, but impossible, in the time allowed us, to understand. ‘This it is that weighs us down. —Remember the situation in which my jearned friend, Mr. Erskine was; you saw how even he was oppressed by it; it was not possible for human ability, and I feel it so, because it was not possible for his standing up to repel a charge drawn by such subtle reasoning, out of such a complication of facts ; it was not possible for the ability of man so to coraprehend and embrace, in his mind, those facts, as to enable him to lay before you a fair defence for the prisoner. 
GIBBS 11560 Gentlemen, in order to make what I have to address to you upon this subject intelligible, it is necessary that I should first state to you what I conceive the law of the subject to be, and what questions that law submits to your consideration in the present case. This is to be looked for—First, m the indictment; next, in the statute upon Which the indictment is founded. 1 say it is to be looked for in the indictment, because it is necessary that the indictment should charge the prisoner with some fact or facts, which, in law, amount to 
GIBBS 11561 The charge against the prisoner is, that he has compassed the king’s death, and that, for the purpose of carrying that design, entertained against the king’s life, into execution, he has done certain acts stated in the indictment. 
GIBBS 11562 The treason charged is, that he compassed the king’s death; the means by which he is stated to have endeavoured to effect this purpose, are, 
GIBBS 11563 First, hat he, with others, met, and conspired to. procure a convention and meeting, with intent, and in order that the persons to be assembled at such convention and Meeting, should and might, wickedly and traitorously, without, and in defiance of the authority, and against the will of the parliament of this kingdom, subvert and alter, and cause to be subverted and altered, the legislature, rule, and government, now duly and happily established in this kingdom, and depose, and cause to be deposed, our said lord the king
GIBBS 11565 This indictment is founded upon the statute of Edward the third, upon which my learned friend argued very ably and elaborately. You observe that, before this statute, different opinions had been entertained as to what was, and what was not treason; and men had been drawn into the penalties of treason, without suspecting that they had incur them. 
GIBBS 11566 The statute recites, ‘ that divers opinions had been entertained in what case treasqn shall be said, and in what not; and therefore the king, at the request of the Lurds, and of the Commons, makes a declaration of what shall be treason; that is to say, when a man doth compass or imagine the death of our lord the king, or our lady his queen, or of their eldest son and heir, and thereof be provably attainted of open deed by the people at of their condition, it is to be understood t in that case it ought to be judged treason, that is, high treason. 
GIBBS 11567 Then the statute goes on with a declaration that nothing but that, which is precisely expressed and specified in the statute, shall be treason : “ And because that many other like cases of treason may happen in time to come, which a man cannot think nor declare at this present time, it is accorded, that if any other case, supposed treason, which is not above specified, doth happen before any justices, the justices shall tarry, without any going to judgment of the treason, till the cause be shuwed and declared before the king and his parliament, whether it ought to be judged treason or other felony. 
GIBBS 11568 You have then the indictment stating these points, which yuu are to consider, whether ! the prisoner compassed the king’s death, and ! whether he committed these acts with an intent immediately to depose the king, ie ne main charge is, that he compassed the king’s death. ‘Ihis is the only treason, presented by the indictment, to your inquiry; and this isthe ila have been legally stated in the indictment, since the statute of the 25th of Edward Srd; if this indictment hadvaried from the statute in charging any thing dues not make so, it would be erroneous: if former indictments, from the time of passing the statute to the present, had varied from it, without being noticed, that would not alter the law ultimately to accomplish his death. 
GIBBS 11569 only form in which it cou as treason which the statute upon the subject, because in cases arisin; upon a statute, no established form of legal proceedings can control the statute, but must e corrected by it. 
GIBBS 11570 In this case, however, the form of the indictment and the statute go hand in hand; it appears frum each that nothing shall be treason (nothing, at least, necessary to be considered upon the present occasion), except the compassing the king’s death. You will observe the statute says likewise, that the party must be “ provably attainted of open deed by the people of his condition. Now, upon this statute, lord Coke, who was one of the most learned lawycrs that has ever lived, has commented, and I shall take the liberty shortly of stating his comment, at least that particular part of it, because that will point out to you how careful the law is, and how careful all writers upon the law are, to guard judges and juries against ever extending this statute; it points out the method you ought to use in investigating the charge brought against the prisoner, and therefore I trust it will not be thought useless if I state it to you. 
GIBBS 11571 The treason charged is, you see, a compassin the king’s death; there must be in the min king’s death, but that must be proved to a jury by his acts, and on that part of the su tute in which the legislature says, “ that thr parly shall be provably attainted of ojeo deed by the people of their conditiun, lod Coke has thus commented. gentlemen, where your recollection goes to the argumett of Mr. Erskine, which passed some time ago. Tam sure you will regret that I should repat it, but I will only endeavour to bring bac those things which may have escaped you. Lord Coke says, (3 inst. 12.) “ In ths branch four things are to be observed. Fir, this word provably, that is, upon direct, mnifest proof, not upon conjectural presump tions, or inferences, or strains of wit, tut upon good and sufficient proof; and heria the adverb (provablement) provably hth: great force, and significth a direct and pho proof, which word the King, the Lords ai Commons in parliament did use, for that the offence was so heinous, and was so hesviy and so severely punished, as none other tte like, and therefore the offender must praca be attainted, which. words are as forcibieas upon direct and manifest proof. Note, the word is not probably, for then commune crgvmentum might have served, but the word is procably be attainted. ; This you see, gentlemen, is an exhortation to you who are to find whether the prisuner or is not guilty; that you do not find bin guilty, without plain, direct, and manic! proof—this is the proof which the legislate requires for the purpose of fixing this noe upon the prisoner; this is the proof which a course you, who are the jury to try his quit innocence, must be satisfied has been zea in the cause, before you can find him gulls. Gentlemen, I will trouble you tarther. merely with a statement of the way in whica judges who have had to try causes upva ths statute, have laid down the law to the Juv. I shall then have stated to you the indictuert —the statute upon which it is founded, the construction of one of the most learned lsyers who ever lived upon that statute, andtie acting of one of the most learned judges a has ever adorned the bench (I speak of chief justice Pemberton) when he sat on bt trial of lord Russell, who was charged with aa offence of the same sort as that with whi! 
GIBBS 11572 alluded to in court, and not from the ba, bet from the bench. I have heard the sm rible treason and traitorous compassings, imaginations, and purposes aforesaid, he, the said William Russell, together with other false traitors, maliciously, traitorously, and advi-sedly between themselves, and with divers other traitors to the jurors unknown, did meet tovether, consult, agree, and conclude insurrection and rebellion against our sovereign lord the king within this kingdom of England, to move and stir up, and the guards fur the preservation of the person of our said Lord the king to seize and destroy, against the duty of his allegiance. So you see the charge in that indictment was, that lord Russell had compassed the king’s death, and to effect that treason, had conspired to raise insurrection and rebellion against the king, and to seize the ds appointed for the preservation of the king’s person. The evidence given in that case went certainly to show, if it went to show any thing, that lord Russell had conspired to raise insurrection and rebellion in the kingdom, and to seize the king’s guards, and yet lord chief justice Pemberton in summing up (Istate this to show what is the matter for you to inquire into in this case) does not tell the jury that the point for them to consider is, whether the prisoner had conspired to raise insurrection and rebellion against the person of the king ; and if they found that, they must find the prisoner guilty; but he tells them this— “now the question before you will be, whether upon this whole matter you do believe —not that lord Russell had raised insurrection and rebellion against the king, but “ whether you do believe my lord Russell had any design upon the king’s life, to destroy the king, or take away his life ;"—that is the charge which my lord chief justice Pemberton gives to the jury who tried lord Russell, and no man ever complained that the trial of lord Russell was not sufficiently severe— that (he says) is the material part here, itis used and given you by the king’s counsel as an evidence of this, that he did conspire to raise an insurrection, and to cause a rising of the people to make as it were, a rebellion within the nation, and to surprise the king's guards, which, say they, can have no other end but to seize and destroy the king. So that lord chief justice Pemberton puts it to the jury, that though they believed these facts, yet from these facts they were to collect whether the prisoner had, or had not, a design upon the king's life, for if he had not, they could not find him guilty; if that had not been his opinion of the law upon this subject, he would not have put it to them to say whether lord Russell by this means meant to accomplish the king's death, but would have put it—do you believe he conspired to raise an insurrection and rebellion against the person of the king? if you believe that, you believe enough ; he does not say that—says they put this to vou as an evidence that he meant to seize and destroy the kin; and he goes on to say—“ it is a great evidence 
GIBBS 11574 Gentlemen, I should tell you that either on that same morning, or the day before, some other prisoners had been tried for being accomplices in the Rye-house plot, and a part of that plot was not only to raise an insurrection against the king, but to seize his person, and murder him; therefore lord chief justice Pemberton says—“ you have not evidence in this case, as there was in the other matter that was tried in the morning: or yesterday, against the conspirators to kill the king at the Rye. There was a direct evidence of a consult to kill the king; that is not given you in this case; this 1s an act of contriving a rebellion, and an insurrection within the kingdom, to seize his guards, which is urged as an evidence, and surely is in itself an evidence to seize and destroy the king. So that lord chief justice Pemberton puts it to the jury that these facts are strong evidence of that which they are to inquire into, namely, a compassing the king’s death, but he puts it to them as the evidence, and distinguishes the case from the cases in the morning, where the design was, to seize and destroy the king. Where is the need of that distinction, if con as is now contended by the counsel for the crown, conclusively and directly treason in itself? He goes on to say, “ upon this whole matter this is left to you; if you believe the prisoner at the bar to have conspired the death of the king, and in order to that to have had those consults that those witnesses speak of, then you must find him guilty of this treason that is laid to his charge,—that is, if you find that he conspired the death of the king ; but unless you draw that conclusion from the other evidence in the cause, you cannot find him guilty; this is lord chief justice Pemberton’s summing up to the jury; and yet he is complained of by the friends of lord Russell, as having dealt too hardly with him ; therefore I think it cannot be imputed to him that he did this in any favour to the prisoner—he states the point for the jury to be, whether they think that the prisuner conspired to put the king to death. J admit that under many circumstances, a jury ought to draw that con they will draw that conclusion, or not. I think upon much consideration of the question, not only that the existence of the overt-act is for the jury, but that it is also for them to find whether the overt-act was committed in the prosecution of that design upon the king’s life, which must be stated in the indictment; not only does this appear to be the opinion of lord chief justice Pemberton, but of sir George Treby, who was then recorder of London, and who afterwards was lord chief justice of the Common Pleas. Lord Russell was found guilty—the jury did find from the facts laid before them, from his conspiring to raise an insurrection against theperson ef the king, and more than that from is design to scize those very guards that are appointed for the protection of the king’s erson, that he did conspire the death of the ing, and I cannot say it was an unreasonable conclusion. You shall hear whether this is an inaccurate expression of lord chief justice Pemberton’s, or whether it was generally considered then as the law. Lord Russell afterwards, when he was brought up for judgment, desires to have the indictment read to him, When he hears the charge against him of compassing and conspiring the king’s death he starts—he says, “ hold, I thought I had not been charged in the indictment of compassing and conspiring the death of the king. The attorney general says, “ yes, my lord, you are. Then he says to the recorder— ‘T appeal to you and the Court, even if all the witnesses have sworn be true, whether I am guilty within the statute of Edward 3d, there aving been an evidence of a conspiracy to levy war, but no evidence of an intention to kill the king; and therefore I think truly jndgment ought not to pass upon me for conspiring the death of the king, of which there was no proof by any one witness. That is only lord Russell’s argument—how is he answered by sir George Treby ? he does not say, what you state to have been sworn to by some of the witnesses is treason, but he says— that was an exception proper (and as I think you did make it) before the verdict, whether the evidence does amount to prove the charge; that is proper to be observed to the jury ;’—Sir George Treby then agrees with the chief justice, that it was for the jury to determine whether the evidence of conspiring to raise an insurrection and rebellion in the kingdom, and to seize the king's guard, does or does not prove a compassing of the king’s death; he admits that it is not treason in law, but it may be evidence of compassing the king's death, if the jury think proper to drawthat conclusion. He goes on—“ for if the evidence comes short of the indictment, they cannot find it to bea true charge, but when the jury has found it, their verdict does pass for the truth, we are bound by the verdict as well as your lordship. We are to go by what the jury have found, not by the eidence that was laid before them. 
GIBBS 11575 So, you see, itis plain, in this case fror the direction given by lord chief justice Peaberton, in summing up; and from the tex pitulation of that summing up, if I may soa! It, by sir George Treby, when lord Ruse: was brought up for judgment, that the po: for the jury is, whether the overt act, lad & the subsequent part of the indictment, prove the treason laid in the furmer part of their dictment, namely, the compassing the king: death. I never will stand up to contend t: there are not many acts of this sort stated in my lord Russeil’s case, from which an hoes!jury ought always to find that the prisdid compass the king’s death. I think theewas in that case, supposing the fact tok proved that he meant to raise insurrection ad rebellion in the state inst the king. axthat he meant to seize t ards of the king, I think that was strong evidence to go to jury, that his attempt aimed at the kgs life, and I cannot blame thesa fer finding t verdict that they did; yet still it was wb them. 
GIBBS 11576 Gentlemen, having stated what I comer to be the law upon this subject, and ansfrom that what the points are for your con deration, I will state to you now the cha which has been attempted in evidence, 10 brought against the prisoner ; 1 have stated it before, but in order to render myself inte ligible, I will shortly repeat it—it is, “ tha he conspired to procure a convention, wld convention, when met, was to overtum tte government, to depose the king, and to pal him to death. To a certain point we st agreed—we agree that he did hold consult j tions for the purpose of calling a conve tion—the point upon which we differ ispurpose for which that convention was tobe called ; and it is for my learned friends lo are of counsel for the crown, before they abring this charge home upon the prisoneraprove one or other of these two things, eliethat a convention cannot be called for wy other but treasonable purposes, or to prt. in fact, that this convention was called & the purpose of procuring the deposition of Ueking, and thereby his death : they must pro one or other of these two things. Now trfirst it is impossible to prove—to assert thats convention, or meeting of delegates from dt ferent sets of people, cannot be called ther but for treasonable purposes, would absurd, and ne such thing can pass from tt mouth of either of my friends. You ae heard of many, many conventions that bvbeen called; there were two conventionScotland, they were not proved indeed, witnesses did speak of them, and thet ad when the jury has found it, their verdict doesity was never puesto pass for the truth—we are bound by the ver
GIBBS 11578 I allude to them merely as showing that conventions may be called for lawful purposes. 
GIBBS 11579 Then the next thing to be considered is, whether the attorney general has proved that this convention was called for that specific unlawful purpose which he has stated, namely, to depose the king (for that is the gist of the cause) and thereby to compass his death— they undertake to prove this; we, on the other hand, say, that the convention was meant to be called for lawful purposes; we say that the prisoner at the bar, and those with whom he acted, believed that corruption had found its way into the state, and was making large strides in it; that he believed this corruption was occasioned, encreased, and continued by the long duration of parliaments, and by the unequal representation of the people in the House of Commons; that if these defects could be reformed, all would be well ; he knew, and they knew, thata petition to parliament would not produce the end which they wished to procure, because matty of their petitions had been, I may almost say contumeliously, rejected ; they thought, therefore, that it lay upon them, as g citizens, to find some other means by which they might effect what they conceived to bea lawful purpose; and they believed that if the general opinion of the people was for this reform, and if that general opinion could be made known to parliament, that parliament, though it had rejected the separate petitions of individuals, would yet attend to the general opinion properly conveyed to them; they saw no other way of conveying this opinion to parliament, but by calling together a convention of delegates sent from different parts of the country, by the voice of which delegates they might first collect whether this was, or was not, the general wish of the people, and if it was so, that they might by the same voice communicate this general wish to parliament. This they professed, and there can be no doubt that this the language of their resolutions imports. 
GIBBS 11580 On the other hand, the gentlemen who are of counsel for the crown say that all this was mere pretext—you did not think that there was corruption in the state; you did not think that that corruption arose from the unequal representation of the people in the House of Commons, and the long duration of parliament; you did not think that this reform, which you speak of, would produce a remedy—you had other views, and we take upon ourselves to prove that you had them. Certainly it does lie upon them to prove these other purposes ; and as the language of our resolutions imports that our intentions were innocent, unless they can show from positive and direct proof, from that plain, direct, and manifest evidence which lord Coke says is necessary in all cases of treason, that the prisoner, and those with whom he was concerned, did endeavour to bring about a revolution in by means of this convention, it is impossible that you can find him guilty of the charge that is now brought against him. 
GIBBS 11581 Gentlemen, there are two parts of the proposition which, in point of fact, the counsel for the crown feel it necessary to make out. In the first place, they say we will prove there was a general plot in the kingdom for effecting this purpose, that is for effecting the deposition of the king. In the next place, we will prove that the prisoner, with others, was an actor in this plot, and is implicated in the crime in which they are all implicated. Now you will recollect that for the sake of making out that first part of their proposition, which brings no guilt to the mind of the prisoner— which shows no intention of his to bring about that which is imputed to the others ; they have not only called many members of all these societies, but have proved every thing that ever was done or declared by any member either of the Constitutional Society, the Corresponding Society, or any members of any other society that ever corresponded with either of these societies ; that they say is for the purpore of proving the general plot. This would not be evidence as against the prisoner individually, but this it is necessary for them to go through, in order to make out the first part of their proposition, that there did really exist a general plot in the kingdom, for the purpose of deposing the king, and afterwards they endeavour to show you that the prisoner was concerned in that plot; this you see does not touch the prisoner, without proot thathe was concerned in what they call the general plot. 
GIBBS 11582 Now, gentlemen, this certainly does lay us under considerable hardships. I told you before, and I am sure you will afterwards hear from his lordship that nothing of this species of evidence, which is not brought home personally to the prisoner, ought to affect him personally; that it goes only to prove the existence of a plot, and yet how difficult is it for us who stand as counsel for the prisoner ; how difficult for you who are the arbiters of his fate; how difficult for the Court, who yet will do it better than either of us can, to distingnish the separate parts of this evidence, to say what tends only to prove the general plot, and what to affect the prisoner personally ! 
GIBBS 11583 The difficulty upon us is insuperable, not from the nature of the thing, but from the extentof the evidence into which we were carried ; for I declare that, with all the diligence which I have been able to use, and with all the time which the indulgence of the Court has granted me, I feel it utterly impossible, in my own mind, to separate them, and, therefore, it is impossible for me to state where the line of distinction lies. If my learned friends, who conducted the prosecution, had first finished their gencral evidence, and had then gone to that which was to bring it home to the prisoner, we might to 3 certain degree have been able to distinguish the state, and hurl the king from his throneit, but as the case is they have jumbled alt and opinion of many people wiser than he (I would not have used these expressions if the noble duke had not left the courty—it does, I say, appear to me folly, but then when these opinions are thus promulgated, that which is folly may reasonably be supposed to find its way into the mind of a shoe-maker. 
GIBBS 11584 Another topic which was urged upon the prisoner strongly, in the opening, was, that French terms were continually used in the resolutions; and therefore it was supposed that Mr. Hardy and those with whom he acted, wished to introduce into this country, all that anarchy which had been produced in France, by those who use the same terms
GIBBS 11587 My argument upon that subject was couched in a word, I said, we offer this evidence to show that a convention kid held in Scotland, before the time we heldthis. 
GIBBS 11589 No; that is my reasoning upoe the subject. 
GIBBS 11591 We meant to show, that the term “ Convention, which they insist to be of French origin, is not so. gentlemen, I submit to you, that my argument upon this subject is a fair one, and a conclusive one; either the use of French terms is or is not material in this case, and is, or is not to be argued upon
GIBBS 11593 If we are to consider these papers, let us take them all; let that which makes for the prisoner be taken, as well as that which Makes against him; the counsel for the crown say that the prisoner had no intention to bring about annual parliaments and universal suffrage, that it is alla pretence. 
GIBBS 11594 Gentlemen, look at the papers which will be summed up by my lord, when the solicitor general has gone through his reply, and you will find them full of these declarations ; you will find the complaint is of the corruption of the present House of Commons; you will find that the cause of that complaint is always stated to be the partial representation of the people in that House ; you will find that the objects sought by the prisoner, and those with whom he acted, were annual parliaments and universal suffrage, folly I think, and I dare sey you think so,—but yet it is the expression 
GIBBS 11595  a i a ad because the effect of these two decisions would be this, that the counsel for the prosecution may argue against the prisoner, from certain facts, which the prisoner, though he knows them to be false, shall not be permitted to controvert. This cannot, surely be supported, and therefore all arguments arising from the use of French terms, must, as it appears to me be excluded from the cause. Another thing imputed to us is, that we approve the French Revolution
GIBBS 11597 You find, in many instances, they speak of the king, and the herelitars nobility of this country, as entitled to reverence and respect. —Was it so in France? Were the king and nobility of that country entitled to the reverence and respect of the subjects of France, as the king and nobility of this country are entitled to the reverence and respect of the people here
GIBBS 11599 But more than that, wishes of union with France had been expressed
GIBBS 11601 The remarks which have been made on the Address to the National Convention are open to the same answer. 
GIBBS 11602 Then the insertion of Roland and Barrere’s speeches is attempted to be fixed upon Mr. Hardy ; and mark how wide he stands from it; there is a resolution, at a meeting of the society, that certain speeches in the French language, from a French newspaper, should be inserted in their books, and they never are inserted. 
GIBBS 11603 Do you think, that that shoemaker understands French? Do you think, that that shoemaker ever read the Moniteur? Can you believe that, at the time when that passed, he could have any idea of what were the contents of these speeches? — Not that I admit, by any means, that, if the fact were proved upon him; if he were the person who made that motion, that it proves any thing in this cause. What does it amount to? That he wished to have communicated to the members of this society, what the reasons were upon which those who were desirous of bringing about that calamitous event in France, acted; if he thought those reasons were convincing; if he thought they ought to be followed up by an execution of the design; though I should differ from him most unquestionably, yet I am far from thinking and i am sure you will be far from thinking, that it is to be inferred from thence, that he compassed the death of his own king. What has the state of France to do with England? What were the grounds of accusation against the king of France? A constitution had been received in the country, of which the king was a part; the accusation against the king was, that he had violated that constitution; perhaps he was in the same situation there, in which James the second was here. 
GIBBS 11604 I do not say that the prisoner might not be misguided; I do not say that those by whom he was advised, or with whom he acted, might Not have misled him ; but even if he had read the speeches himself, if he had himself entered the resolutions on the book in English, 1 do insist that it does not furnish a presumption that he compassed the death of the king of England. The circumstances of that nation and this are widely different—Thank God ! the king of England lives in the hearts of his subjects; there is nv accusation against him that he has violated the constitution of this country; he has by his public and private virtues deserved and acquived the affections of his subjects; so I think, so you all think, and so the prisoner thinks. And it would be Monstrous cruelty to impute to him a design against the life of the king of England, hecause, under certain circumstances, he wished to have published to a society of people, the reasons upon which certain persons in France thought it right to bring their king to a calamitous end. 
GIBBS 11605 Itis said, that the prisoner, and those with whom he acted, must have intended by assembling this convention to act with force against the government, because, forsooth, they had resolved that they would no longer Petition parliament. Now, it seems to me, that that resolution naturally preceded the calling together such a convention as I have stated the prisoncr intended to call, and as I insist he might legally call. If the petitions of individuals had obtained from parliament that which it was their object to obtain by calling this convention, then the calling the convention would be unnecessary; but it was because the petitions of separate individuals had been rejected, and because the prisoner, and those with whom he acted, thought that the voice of the people might be raised louder than by petitions of individuals, and that then it would be heard : it was for that reason that he meant to call this convention ; the object of the convention was, to petition parliament in a different form, and in a voice that was more likely to be heard by them, in a voice which, he supposed, would be that of the Majority of the people of England. 
GIBBS 11606 entlemen, you heard read to you that which I shall have occasion to state more at large hereafter: the protest of that great coo stitutional lawyer, lord Camden, together with thirty-two other peers, against the nega tive put upon a motion for a committee to quire into the expenditure of the pubic money
GIBBS 11608 Why then, gentlemen, alter private petr tions have been received and rejected, It & lawful for the people to associate tor ep pose of obtaining that which parliament alone can give to them; and such associations are, (I am using the language of lord Camden, as great a constitutional lawyer as ever lived) such associations are legal and constitutional; and this is a legal and constitutional method of collecting the voice of the people, and of carrying it to the ear of parliament. 
GIBBS 11609 The next general topic of argument that was insisted upon by the attorney general, and the head of evidence that he went into was, I think, the proceedings of Mr. Hardy, and those with whom he was concerned 0 the Scotch Convention. He began with the instructions that were given to the delegates, whom they sent to that convention, and tbe article which he relies on as showing that the prisoner is guilty of the charge brought against him, was the seventh, in which it is stated “ That it is the duty of the people to resist any act of parliament repugnant to the original principles of the constitution, as would be every attempt to prohibit associa tions for the purpose of reform. 
GIBBS 11610 T certainly disagree with him in tbat; I certainly think that that was an improper resolution, but it is not an act of high treasoa; 
GIBBS 11611 suppose a particular act of parliament, o noxious to the public, is resisted ; suppose men tise in bodies to resist it; suppose they mise an insurrection in the country to resist it; that is high treason ; but conspiriag to rise an insurrection for the purpose of resisting such an actis not high treason
GIBBS 11613 Why then, gentlemen, if conspiring to raise an insurrection against an existing law, and to resist the operation and execution of that law, be not high treason, a fortiori, a resolution, to Oppose, if it shall be passed, a law which at present has no existence, cannot be high treason. «The prisoner, Mr. Hardy, is a member of the London Corresponding Society; he and those who acted with him are only affected by the Scotch Convention, as far as that convention acted under their authority, or with their approbation; as faras thev acted under their authprity—they are not attected by any thing but this resolution. When the convention met they came to some resolutions which I do not find myself interested upon this occasion to detend any farther than this, that they certainly are not overt acts of high treason; to them the same answer applies as applies to this resolution; they do not amount to any conspiracy for the purpose of raising or levying a war against the king’s person; nothin likeit; and, therefore, though they are sack asa quiet and reasonable man would disapprove, yet they are not such as amount to the Crime of high treason. I beg you always, gentlemen, to hold it in your minds that the question you have to try is, whether the prisoner, and those persons, with whom he was concerned, meant to call this convention for the purpose of overturning the government, and thereby deposing and destroying the king. Now you will not find throughout the whole course of these proceedings any evidence testifying that intent; you will find strong language used in letters that are written, very strong, perhaps—strong resolutions, but none of them amount to a proof of the crime with which he is charged; nor does it appear to me, however criminal they were, that he ought to be charged with any of the acts of that convention; none of them were high treason undoubtedly. 
GIBBS 11614 But how do they endeavour to fix them upon Mr. Hardy and those with whom he acted? merely by showing that when irritated at the fate of their delegates, whom they had sent there, and at that which they were told, trom high authority, was a horrid and unjustifiable judgment against them, they passed some violent, 1 will say, indecent resolutions upon the subject. , 
GIBBS 11615 Something is due to the human mind in that state; you will not be extreme to mark what is amiss in a case of this sort; you will look to the intention, and see if any thing is proved against this prisoner, which can brin; home to his mind the criminal act charge: upon this indictment, and unless you find some one act which furnishes plain direct and manifest proof, in the words of lord Coke, of a conspiring to overturn the government and depose the king, you will cast out of your mind such expressions as I am alluding to, and you will find, however you may disapprove of his conduct in some respects, that he 1s not guilty of that high crime which is now imputed to him. 
GIBBS 11616 It is said (I think it is uot supportable in law) that these delegates who met in convention in Scotland were guilty of high treason, and that therefore Mr. Hardy, who was one of a suciety who sent delegates, and who might approve the proceedings that passed there, that he also is guilty of high treason. I cannot bring myself to believe that it was really thought that the proceedings of the convention in Scotland brought the crime of high treason home to those who assented to them here; because I cannot understand how the conspiring here to do that can be high treason which was not high treason in those who did the thing in Scotland. You know very well, gentlemen, that the delegates, who sat in that convention, were prosecuted ; but they were not prosecuted for high treason, but for a misdemeanor. ‘The lord justice Clerk had the’same evidence befure him on that subject that you have now; ifit had been hightreason heywould have done that which it was his duty to do; he would not have tried the prisoners for a misdemeanor—he would have told the jury, on the first trial, that they must find the prisoner not guilty of the misdemeanor, because his offence was of a greater magnitude ; and a person. must not be brought to trial for a misdemeanor when the facts amount to proof of a higher crime. WhatI say upon this subject is law, his lordship will tell you so, that if a man be indicted for a crime of a lower description, and upon the trial the evidence goes to prove that he was guilty of one of a higher description, he cannot in law be convicted of that crime of a lower description ; and therefore I have the authority of the court of justiciary in Scotland ; the authority of those who instituted and conducted those prosecutions for misdemeanor only, to say that the meeting of the Scotch Convention, the acts of the delegates (1 am not speaking of Downie and Watt, they were not connected with them) were not high treason, and, therefore, the conspiring here to bring about these acts could not be so. ‘ 
GIBBS 11617 Gentlemen, these appear to me to be the general observations arising out of the mass of evidence, with which we are loaded in this cause, and from which the counsel for the crown would persuade you to believe, that the risoner, and those with whom he acted, have een guilty of high treason. I come now to the parol evidence, and I beg again and again to bring to your recollection that the question upon this part of the case is, whether the prisoner in conspiring to call together this convention meant to depose the king : I come now to that parol evidence by which the crown has endeavoured to su port this position, that the direct object of all these societies was, to drive the king from his throne, and thereby to compass his death. 
GIBBS 11618 The first two witnesses whom they called upon this subject were, two men from Sheffield, Camage and Broomhead; they are witnesses for the crown, and therefore their evidence is unimpeachable as far as it makes for us most certainly. They are called to prove that preparations were made to support measures of violence by which this convention was to carry its projects into execution; for you know, gentlemen, to suppose that a convention was to be called that were to act with force against the whole body of the government, and to depose the king, and notto show that that convention was furnished with something like adequate means to effect that intention, would be absurd and nonsensical. 
GIBBS 11619 They found it incumbent upon them, therefore, to lay before you pat that the prisoner, and those with whom he acted, had prepared means for supporting this convention by force against the whole armed body of the government. For this purpose they call Camage and Broomhead, and certainly they both do prove some of the facts, at least, which the crown called them to prove; they proved that some pikes were prepared at Sheffield : I admit it—but how does the fact come eut upon their cross-examination? What was the purpose for which these pikes were prepared? Watch the account that the witnesses for the crown who were called before you to tell you all the truth, and whose evidence you TMust attend to, as far as it makes for the prisoner, as well as against him, and must give equal credit to it,—see the reason they give for making these pikes ; they say they were made by aparty to whom they, the witnesses, belong, because they had ground, just and reasonable ground to apprehend that they should themselves be attacked by the opposite party. Broomhead had been beset in his house; inflammatory hand-bills had been sent abroad; a gun had been fired under the door of one of their houses, and that gun had been fired by a member of an armed body, who were of political sentiments opposite to the society. Then what becomes of the line of evidence which is directed by the crown to this object; namely, to show that the prisoner, and those who acted with him, had been conspiring with the people at Sheffield to procure pikes for the purpose of supporting this convention, when it should te called against the whole power of the ment of this country? They had prepared ikes, but their own witnesses tell you why they prepared them; they had prepared themte cause their persons their houses, and their ives were not safe; they had actually been attacked, their houses assailed, and inflammatory han bills had been circulated round the town, 2 viting people to attack them by force, and ther thought they might legally do that which they will never be toldthey may not legally do, tht when attacked they may repel force by force, and may make preparation for such resistance, if they have reason to expect an attack. 
GIBBS 11620 The late history of this country shows hew necessary this measure was, and some inst ces which I shall state, show to how purposes such force may be applied. We bare not forgotten the calamities of doctorPriestiey, at Birmingham; we know that there a mb, because they happened to differ from him ad some friends of fs in political opinions, beet his house, and rased it to the id; woold it not have been lawful for doctor Priestky upon that occasion, to have opposed that fore, and to have prepared for it, if he had forewea it? Then was it not lawful for these peopk, when they had notice from the opposite party that they should be attacked; when they bad actually in some instances been attacked; when inflammatory hand-bills had bea sent round the town for the purpose of aciting people to attack them, was it tha unlawful in them to prepare the means of de fence against such an attack? and how is the preparation made by them of these arms fr their defence to be construed into an act of high treason in Mr. Hardy, because, truly, Mr. Hardy laine member of the Comes ponding Society here, has corresponded wih a ieabe of the Sheffield Society, of whrh society these men who had so provided for the defence of their persons and houses, wet members. This is coming at treason, not by plain, direct, and manifest proofs ; not evenby that by which lord Coke says it oughtnot tote come at, by inferences, butcoming at itby fake and unfounded reasoning; it isassigning too cause what the evidence ascribes to another; it is attributing to these people a design whit they certainly had not, and which the w nesses who proved the fact of their having the pikes state they had not, thereby to implicate ina supposed lesign, which was never enletained by these men, the prisoner, who hid no sort of connexion with them. 
GIBBS 11621 Not only doctor Priestley was attacked Birmingham, but Mr. Walkerand other pe sons were attacked in the same manne t Manchester. We know also that Mr. Dent son, at Nottingham was so attacked, buthiring notice of it before-hand, he did pnvie himself with arms to defend himself sist that attack ; he used those arms, be was he the place, and two of the rioters who attacked his house fell, and the inquest upon that death found it justifiable homicide. What would have been the fate of Mr. Dennison, if he had not prepared himself with those means of defence 
GIBBS 11623 These instances show not only the neccssity, but the legality of providing arms against such attacks, when we are furnished with means of foreseeing them. But, gentlemen, not only do they take off all effect from that fact which was proved on the part of the crown, that pikes had been provided at Sheffield, but they prove something more. You observe that all the members of the Constitutional and London Corresponding Societies, and the Societies at Sheftield are endeavoured to be implicated in a general plot to calla convention for the purpose of deposing the king, and upon that ground the declarations and acts of all those people are received in evidence against us; we have a right then to ask them, when any of them are called here, what their views were ; if their views were to calla convention for the purpose of deposing the king, so far the plot is proved. Then what do the witnesses say? Camage and Broomhead are called by the crown, they say they had no idea of attacking the King, or the House of Lords; they had no idea of any thing but calling a convention which might make known to the House of Commons what was the pois opinion of the people; they had no idea of effecting the views of the convention by force, but only by the progress of reason; they meant to collect what was the general opinion of the people of the country, and if it should turn out to be the general opinion that this reform of parliament ought to be effected, then they believed, and I believe too, that the House of Commons would listen to that opinion so signified to them. 
GIBBS 11624 Another witness whom they called is Widdison. He comes from the same place, and you will recollect here that there had been given in evidence a letter from one Davison of Sheflield, to Mr. Hardy, stating what was true, that the patriots at Sheffield had provided themselves with pikes for their defence ; it is insisted that this defence was alla pretext, but when you come to hear the witnesses for the crown you see that it was not a pretext, that there was real danger of an attack. This Davison writes to Mr. Hardy, informing him that the patriotshad provided themselves with pikes for their defence, and telling him where their friends in London might supply themselves with pikes, if they thought proper, for the same purpose. It is imputed to Mr. Hardy the receiving this letter shows that he meant to provide this convention, or those who vere Ae act ame the opaxenten, with arms for the purpose of supporti! ir pretensions by force. It tent out that this letter contains another letter, to Norwich, which Mr. Hardy was desired to forward; both the letter to Mr. Hardy, and the letter for Norwich, remained in Mr. Hardy’s ssion from April 26th to the 12th of May, when they were seized ; he does not send that letter to Norwich, and he never mentions to his division that he had received such a letter; he never proposes to any of them to furnish themselves with arms. What then isthe fair conclusion to be drawn from these facts? You were in danger at Sheffield, and you provided yourselves with pikes there, and you did right In doing so; but we do not yet feel there is the same danger in London; we do not believe that we shall be attacked ; therefore Mr. Hardy takes no notice of this communication; he does not send the letter to Norwich, Nor state it to his division, or to any of his friends in London, except in the instance I shall mention presently. I say he took no step upon it, because he is desired to address any answer to one Moody at Sheffield, who is afterwards called asa witness by the crown, and who swore positively that no letter from Mr. Hardy, or any of the society, ever came to his hands; a conclusive proof that nothing was done by Mr. Hardy, or any of his society, at least with his knowledge, upon that letter, and it is, therefore, conclusive proof that he did not mean, upon a concert between him and Davison, to use these arms which were rovided at Sheffield for the protection and lefence of that society, he did not mean to use them against the government of the country. 
GIBBS 11625 Widdison, who is called also to this fact of the pikes, is cross-examined by us as to the purposes of their institution; he and they all Join in telling you their object was only parliamentary reform, that they wished to obtain it by peaceable means; that they meant to call this convention, not in order that they might oppose the government forcibly, not in order that they might take upon themselves the functions of parliament, not that they might enforce their opinions by dint of arms, but merely that they might represent to the House of Commons, what was the opinion of the majority of the people. 
GIBBS 11626 Hill, another witness, also states the same things ; he proves they had the pikes, but he proves that they were provided for the same purpose. Then great reliance is placed upon the evidence of Edwards; it is said that Mr. Hardy did communicate this letter to Edwards, and furnished him with the means of getting these pikes. Now how did he communicate it to him
GIBBS 11628 Hardy and asks him if he could give him the direction to a person who made the pikes at Sheffield; Hardy having this letter in his pocket, never having communicated it to a single soul (for, if be had, the prosecutors would have knownit, for they have had spies upon him for these three years), being asked by Edwards for a direction to a man at Sheffield, he does give him that direction, and that is the only use Hardy ever makes of the letter he received from Shetteld, and he makes no use whatever of the inclosure to Norwich; Hardy did not want any of these pikes— how came Edwards to ask for them? Not from any communication he had with Hardy; he is the crown’s witness, and what he says on one side must be believed, as well as what he says on the other; he had it, he says, for the purpose of defending himself, if illegally stat ba, He says great insults had been offered him, and it was for that purpose only that he desired a direction to this man. He made one for himself. Is Mr. Hardy answerable for all his acts? And if he were, what does this amount to? Entertaining, perhaps, a fulse idea of a danger that threatens him, he chose to provide himself with a pike, and to advise two or three other persons to do the same thing. Is this evidence that can convince any reasonable mind, or can go a Step towards convincing a man of common Teason that these pikes were procured by Mr. Hardy, and those he acted with, for the puspose of supporting this convention which was to be called, for the purpose of resisting by force the whole united military of this kingdom, and all the armed associations whic have been raised in the country 
GIBBS 11630 If these people had the will, they had me means; and you are to try whether ther ind the will; you are to try whether it was tle intention of these people to call this conve tion, and then to act themselves, through iis convention, by force of arms; now if yuu ind them making no preparation for this, if re find them not prepared to attack a sinzk company of guards, if it resisted them ; it becomes incredible that they should enternm any such project. In most cases of projected insurrection that we know from history, collect from the State Trials, there is either party in the country in arms to which the m surgents can immediately attach themselves, or else there are preparations for the levvze troops, which troops are to be collected, ead to be formed into a body at the time that th conspirators themselves are to rise ; but here there is a convention to meet immediatels, and yet no proof of that, without which thy indictment cannot stand fora moment, no prot of any levies on fcot, nor any preparations i raising that force with which it is pretemied the convention was to act. 
GIBBS 11631 Gentlemen, another witness whom the called is Samuel Williams, and he is to prove not only that Mr. Hardy had provided himet with pikes to enforce thedecrees of this cov vention, but also that he had embodied a fe of musketeers to serve under it. Now wht does that evidence amount to? 
GIBBS 11632 Mr. Samuel Williams, whois a gun engrave, and by that means connected with gun-smiths ordered a pair of shoes of Mr. Hardy at the end of the year 1793; he wished him to tek a gun(this doesnot move from Hardy original's. but he asked Hardy to take a gun of his’ Mr. Hardy is supposed to be a man who bad at this time in his minds plan for overturo7g the government by force, and for arming exber this convention itself, or arming an army act under this convention; they were not thee provided with arms; if Mr. Hardy had a tome in buying this gun, but he re such intention as this in his mind he would have caught at the proposal immediately ; this is a fair opportunity, as far as it goes, there can be no pretence to impute any thing uses to percha it; it remains with him a fortnight fore he can find a chap fur it: at the end of that fortnight the man coming again, and the purpose of supportin ordering a pair of boots, he has then got him a-customer. Now is that the conduct of a maa who had such a design in his mind as this indictment imputes to the prisoner? for he must have had it in his mind at this time, if at all, because they say that the conspiracy commenced before the delegates were sent to the Scotch Convention; yet if Mr. Hardy had in his mind the arming a troop for this convention, sarely he would have caught at the opportu. 
GIBBS 11633 way, but he does not. 
GIBBS 11634 nity of providing himself with arms in this A fortnight passes before he could get rid of this gun, and after wards upon the importunity of this man, who was become his customer, he gets off two or more. Then Mr. Hardy is to be affected with the business of Mr. Franklow’s Lambeth Associalion, and Williams says that Mr. Hardy recom

Why itis notorious that Frank!ow had an association, he made no secret of it himself; those who belonged to his corps wore uniforms, he himself appeared publicly in this uniform at the dinner at the T know not whether the asso
GIBBS 11636 ; certainly it was an open and avowed association—probably Franklow, seeing the country full of armed associations, chose to have one ofhis own. Whether he had a right to do it, or not, I do not say, but it certainly is not an act of high treason. Seeing that other people, whom he thought no better affected than himself, had raised men, armed, and drilled them, it-was not unnatural that he should be desirous of doing the same, especially as he had been in the army before; a sort of esprit du corps 
GIBBS 11637 ‘that might belong to my learned friend. I 
GIBBS 11638 remember myself being in arms, and acting asa lieutenant under him (Mr. Erskine] at the time of the riots in the year 1780, and very proud we were of our arms, regimentals 
GIBBS 11639 ‘we had not, but very proud we were of: our muskets. I remember no orders from government to do this, no commission from the lord lieutenant; but as other people associated for the same purpose round us, we did it also; and Mr. Franklow instituted his association in the same way; it was a known public thing, there were printed orders and regulations, and he went publicly about in his uniform, To say that because that unfortunate man at the bar recommended Williams to furnish Franklow’s association with two or three guns, therefore he must be presumed, without farther proof, to have assisted m raising an armed body for the purpose of supporting this convention by force against’ the established government of the country, is the most alarming proposition I ever heard ina court of justice
GIBBS 11641 Gentlemen, the next witness whom they call is Gosling, and Mr. Gosling is one of that infamous set of men (for so surely I may call them) who, having no means of supporting themselves, endeavour to procure a Tivelihood by insinuating themselves into the secrets of others, and discovering them to the government; I do not say that men are not to be charged with acts of theirs discovered by spies, but I say that a man of this description, who gives evidence against persons into whose confidence he has endeavoured to insinuate himself, is to be heard and attended to with very great caution and reserve; his, value rises according to the importance of his testimony, he is a more or less valuable witness according as the acts which he communicates to his employers are more or less criminal; he is interested therefore to enhance them, and to that motive it is that I attribute a great deal of the testimony of Gosling. If a man of this description goes through his evidence fairly, without any objection arising upon the manner in which he gives his testimony ; if he relates to you a plain, regular, conekitent series of facts, I admit thatyou ought to attend to him. But recollect, gentlemen, how this man demeaned himself upon his cross-examination. In his examination in chief he was fluent, he was easy ;, he had all his facts ready, and he stated them all precisely ; but he sunk under my learned friend when he came to the cross-examina- , tion, he was confounded and abashed. I shall not pretend to go through the whole of his evidence, the day would not admit of it; but I remember he stated that one of those persons, whom they would have implicated in the guilt of the prisoncr, said he had been going about the country, to corrupt the soldiers, that he bad corrupted a considerable number of them, but he had found many who stood out againsthim. Now, if thathad been true, you would have had here all those soldiers who resisted him, as witnesses; there could be no difficulty in calling them, it was an easy thing for government to have collected who the men were whom this person had unsuccessfully attempted to tamper with, and their not being able to discover any of those men whom he had so unsuccessfully attempted to corrupt; there not heing called a single witness of that description to support the evidence given by Gosling upon that subject, is a plain proof to me that his evidence in that respect was not true; add to that observation upon his evidence, the manner in which he deported himself upon his cross-examination, the difficulty my learned friend had to get from him any answers to the plainest questions that he put, and I think you will have no doubt to say that what he swears unsupported by any other witnesses, speaking directly to the same facts, is not deserving of any credit in a cause Tike this. 
GIBBS 11642 Gentlemen, another witness of this description is Lynam, his evidence lasted five or six hours; itis utterly impossible for me to ge through it literally, but you recollect that he spoke from notes he had taken, in which he entered short memorandums; he had mistaken a great number of naines which he had entered in these notes, Curtis for Carter, &c. as far as they went they were full of mistakes, and there was hardly a single fact that hie spoke of which fixed any degree of criminality upon Mr. Hardy, or those with whom he was connected, that was found in his notes, but he related those facts from his memory ; if the notes of what he wrote down are so incorrect as to confound one name with another, what credit can you give to his recollection? He tells you that he did not attend to the particular persons who held the conversations of which he speaks, but that this, and that general conversation, passed at these meetlogs. gentlemen, I will tell you why he said this; it might have been dangerous to be more particular ; he might have been contradicted ; and any thing that had been said, by any of those people, he knew was ruled to be evidence of the general plot; consequently what he stated to have been said in general conversation, among them there was evidence.—Who told you this
GIBBS 11644 Did not he think it material, at the time when he attended, to collect the names of those who suid this or that particular thing
GIBBS 11646 There is another witness of the Lambeth Association brought forward to prove ths detestable plot, and that is Mr. Coates, Franklow’s apprentice. The account he gives of this Lambeth Association is, that it was public, that Franklow had a cartouch ber is true, but that cartouch box lay open, with others, upon the work board; he rez mentals, but we heard in evidence befure, that he appeared in them, publicly, at the Globe-tavern. 
GIBBS 11647 They come next, gentlemen, to the evidance of a Mr. Groves, aud I beg your partcular attention to him
GIBBS 11649 Now, in the first place, let us see how Groves, in his examination in chief, relates these facts. With respect to the knives, he tells you, that he was at Chalk Farm; that he was in a shed with about ten people; that five or six of them pulled out a little instrument, all exactly alike, which were French knives, and that Pearce was one of them; that somebody said, they were bread and cheese knives, and then a smile went round; that he asked, where they might be got; they said, at Green’s, in Orange-street, who was & perfumer and hair-dresser; he says, a week after he went to buy one; and then his ob:et is to show you, that Green had sold a great number of these kuives, for the purpose of arming this convention, or their army; aod that he had sold them in such a way as show, that he was sensible of the impzopnety of what he was about; he says, Greea uid him he had sold two or three hundred; be says, 4:¢ told me to speak very low, for the parlour door’ was open, and his wife wasa damn’d aristocrat. It is evident he meant, that it should be inferred from hence, that Green, who was one of this society, had plotted with Mr. Hardy, for arming this multitude that were to support this convention ; that he had contrived to procure these knives from Sheffield, for the purpose of arming them, and had alrcady collected a body of two or threc hundred, thus armed. 
GIBBS 11650 “ Another object that he had, was, to collect the sense of the society, from what passed at the meeting, on the 2nd of May, at the Crown and Anchor; and he tells you, that Mr. Horne Tooke was there, and it is out of his mouth that he collects this
GIBBS 11652 Now see how this comes out in the course of the cross-examination. First, with respect to Mr. Tooke; you remember, that the question here is, whether the prisoner has conspired to call this Convention, for the purpose of deposing the king, and that this witness was examined for the purpose of proving, that language had been held indicative of an intention to overturn the government, and to depose the king; and that this Groves, in his examination in chief, stated to you, that Mr. Tooke had so spoken of the House of Commons, and of the House of Lords
GIBBS 11654 Then what does this evidence amount to P —See what is the question between us
GIBBS 11656 Consider, gentlemen, how very strong this evidence is for us, when it comes out of the mouth of the prosecutor's witness. — We admit, that the object was to induce the Honse of Commons, hearing the general sense of the people, to reform the representation. This is the opinion of Mr. Tooke; this is the language which he held, and which he held in the presence of that spy. 
GIBBS 11657 These observations go completely, not only to put this evidence of Mr. Groves out of the case, as bearing upon this cause, but they go farther, in two respects. First, they go to show (and I am entitled to the full strength of that application of them) that the object, and the only object of these people, was a reform in the House of Commons; that a man, charged to be connected with them in this conspiracy, did, in their face, absolutely negative any design upon the king, or the House of Lords; that he confined his complaints to the House of Commons; that he spoke with respect of the person and of the office of the king, and yet this witness is called to prove, that they wished to drive the king out of his place in the constitution; he proves the direct contrary; he proves, that the object of all the people there assembled, spoken by the voice of Mr. Tooke (I say, that was the object of them all, because none contradicted him) was, to maintain the dignity of the House of Lords, and to maintain the person and dignity of the king. 
GIBBS 11658 Gentlemen, that is not the only use of the evidence of this man; it furnishes us with a fearful example, how much mischief may be done by the evidence of spies; we have no means of correcting their evidence; we know not what will be the course of it; we have no clue ta cross-examine them; and it was mere accident, that his testimony did not leave upon your minds the impression, that Mr. Tooke, in this large assembly, had declared himself against both the House of Commons, and the House of Lords; for he expressly said, at first, that he complimented the House of Lords in the same way that be did the House of Commons, and so we should have been fixed with this imputation, that, sitting at diuner with Mr. Tooke, and five hundred people, all of whom are attempted tobe connected in this plot, we countenanced a doctrine which was publicly broached in that assembly, that all the Lords and Commons were a sink of corruption, and, consequently, that an attack was levelled at them all ; what a situation then would my client have been in, from our not knowing how to examine the witness; from our not knowing how to lead him to the truth, which he kept back, and which he knew to be material, and which he ought, upon his oath, to have told upon his examination in chief; from our not having the clue to his cross-examination, that man at the bar might have been condemned to the extreme punishment of high treason, None but a spy so demeans himself 3 None but a dishonest man; none but a miscreant, like him, seeps back, in his examination in chief, all that he thinks will make for a prisoner, and delivers all that is against him. I am entitled to say he did so; and from thence entitled to caution you, how you credit the testimony of such witnesses, unless you find their evidence confirmed by other witNesses, speaking to the same fact. 
GIBBS 11659 Gentlemen, I have not done with Groves yet; he has beem guilty not only of a supPression of the truth, but he has been guilty of direct perjury; a perjury, committed by him, for the putpose of enhancing his own value with those by whom he is employed, at the price of that man’s life; a crime which, I am sorry to say, is not in law murder; that, however, was his object, and I will shew you it was his object. I observed, that another part of his evidence went to show, that Greea was a conspirator with the rest in this plet; that he had conspired to assist this convestion by force, and, in the prosecution of that conspiracy, had already sold two or three hundred knives, for the purpose of arming the conspirators. 
GIBBS 11660 Groves says, he went to Green's, for the purpose of purchasing one of those knives; that all was secrecy; Green told him “to spesk low, for the parlour door was open, and his wife was a damn’d aristocrat. Now the anly object that he could have in so representsg the thing was, to make you believe, tht Green sold these knives in private. Greenis afterwards called, as a witness for the crowa, and what is the account that he gives of this? Ile tells you, that, in the fair and ordingry course of trade, he had three dozen of these knives, and he had sold, I think, thirteeper fourteen, each to a different person; he hed them sent to him in packages, of six or seven in a package ; he says, he sent one yackagen Mr. Hardy, but that part does not apply to Groves’s evidence. 
GIBBS 11661 This evidence is, you see, inconsistent with the account that Groves gives ; this, however, may not affect Groves with perjury ; because, though this is the truth, Green may have given a different account to Groves. Withs view to ascertain that, he is asked, did you ever tell Groves you had sold two or thre hundred 
GIBBS 11663 I have done with so much of Green’s evidence as relates to the contradiction to Groves. But there is another thing which Green, a witness for the crown, swears to, and which falls in with the rest of our evidence. He is asked, whether he, being a member of this society, and acting with them upon many occasions, whether he had any idea that this society, or any deputation from them, or any convention to which they sent delegates, was either to attack the person of the king, or to effectuate any of their opinions by force of arms? He tells you, in express terms, no, not aman of us, had any such object; our object was parliamentary reform; the means by which we were to effect that parliamentary reform, not being able to effect it by petitions, was, by a convention, to act peaceably. It was first to collect the opinion of the public, and then to represent it to parliament
GIBBS 11665 Then, gentlemen, after these witnesses, who go to the proof of what had passed in England, they endeavour to implicate us in the guilt of Watt, who has been lately executed for high treason, at Edinburgh, and for that purpose they call Mr. McEwan. There is no way by which at at all connect Hardy with Watt, except, I think, thata letter was sent by Hardy to Skirving, who was a member of a society to which Watt belonged; and in a conversation between Watt and Stock, at Eaiabiare, it appeared, that Watt was deSirous of sending a letter to Hardy, and communicated with Stock, how he might send that letter, without saying what it was about; but no such letter appears ever to have been sent; what the subject was upon which he Meant to correspond with him, does not appear; and yet it is in evidence to you, that the letters that were sent to Mr. Hardy, I cannot say, positively, that it appears in evidence that all were, but there is every reason to suppose, that all the letters which were sent to Mr. Hardy, upon this subject, were seized by the crown 3 so that, I think, you that he personally knew that any such man as Watt existed, and yet it is endeavoured to affect him, by what Watt did in Edinburgh, though none of the delegates who sat with Watt there, are attempted to be affected by it. 
GIBBS 11666 Who is this Mr. Watt? Why Watt was a spy, employed by government, up to a certain extent; he was discharged by them from that employment, I believe, because he over-valued his services; so it appeared, I understand, upon his own trial; being discharged by government, he continues to associate with the Scotch Convention, and he makes a violent proposal there, which all who were present reject; I do not mean that, in the convention, he made the proposal; but among some of the members, he made a proposal, which all who were present instantly rejected. 
GIBBS 11667 Now I will tell you what I firmly believe to have been the case. Watt had been a spy ; he had carried communications to government; he pretended, perhaps, to know more than he did; he over-valued the communications he did carry, and therefore was discarded ; he still fixed himself upon these men, who did not know that he bad been a spy, and kept company with him; and I do verily, in my conscience, believe, that he made this pespossl to them with a view to carry the information of it afterwards to government, and then to hang these men, if he could get them to agree with him. I believe that to be the case ; I believe him to have been a determined miscreant, and I am not sorry that he was hanged, if that were the case, because he justly deserved it; but having, as a spy, carried information to government; having required a higher price for his services than vernment thought he deserved, he had n discarded; he afterwards goes back, and makes this proposal, which was rejected withabhorrence by them, and I do verily believe he made this proposal for the sole purpose of implicating them in the guilt of such a project, that he might carry the information to vernment, and thereby show he was worthy of his hire; that he might show he was worth the price he asked, Now take it cither way; that te really meant to accomplish this roject, or that, not meaning to accomplish it, Es wished to draw other people into it, fur the sake of sending them to the gallows, he has met the fate he richly deserved. 
GIBBS 11668 But observe another thing. Watt is to be connected with Mr. Hardy. How? Through the Scotch Convention; because Mr. Hardy corresponded with the Scotch Convention, and because Watt was a member of that con. vention. Good God! have they attempted to fix this guilt upon any of the delegutes to the Scotch Convention, except those two individuals, Watt and Downie 
GIBBS 11670 bit treason
GIBBS 11672 Another observation arises upon this evidence of Mr. McEwan; he is a Scotchman, and he was a member of the Scotch Convention, and you have heard from him what he thinks of the Scotch Convention, and I think You have reason to believe from the manner in which he gave his evidence that you receive from him his real sentiments upon all the subjects upon which he is questioned, and a true relation of all the facts to which he was examined; was there any difficulty in getting from him this account of Watt? Did not he immediately, upon being asked, communicate the whole story? Did not he express his own abhorrence of it? I believe he came voluntarily to give this account; I am sure the contrary does not appear in the cause, and Iam entitled, as counsel for the prisoner, to insist that no fact exists which is not proved. The witness came forward in the ordinary course, and therefore I am entitled to suppose, that coming forward in the ordinary course, he did it voluntarily, in order to state facts to “you, upon which you will have to reason when you come to consider what verdict you will give. When I say that no compulsory means were used to bring this witness to the bar, it is not because it is material to me whether it le so or not, yet still I am entitled to make that assumpticn. Now what is the account he gives of the whole of this business? and here I am answering that part of their case which endeavours to implicate us in the guilt of those persons at Edinburgh. He states that there was no idea of trenching on the authority of the King, or Lords; that there was no idea of assuming the functions of parliament; that nothing was to be done by force, and the very night on which they were dispersed, it appears, they had considered upon petitioning either the parliament, or the king: then, if that were the case, what becomes of the charge against the prisoner? If in all this vast field ot evidence, which they have taken, they cannot prove any design, hy means of this convention in Scotland, to depose the king by force, what becomes of the charge against Mr. Hardy, who was not directly implicated eva in what that convention really did? The charge against him is, that he conspired, wit: others, to call a convention, which convetion was to act by force of arms against tk povennitent of the country, and to depose the ing. Surely the proceedings at Edinbas furnish no proof of this sort against him. 
GIBBS 11673 I observe, and I dare say the fact will relied upon, by the solicitor general in reply, that all the witnesses who have been que tioned to these circumstances (their witnesses as well as ours) were asked by the atlomegeneral, whether they thought certain res tions that were shown to them were peacute and orderly? Some had seen them, sae had not. Now I have nothing to dowd their opinion upon the point, whether the resolutions were peaceable or orderly. Th question, in this cause, is not whether thez people had come to peaceable and orderly m solutions; but the question is whether ther have committed an overt act the direct obet of which was to depose the king, and te ultimate object of which was to bring abon his death; that is the question for your dete mination. And it is very hard upon the pr soner if dust is to be thrown inte the eyes the jury, by endeavouring to fix their attentka upon facts which do not amount to an art«l high treason (for if one act does not, all taken together cannot) for the sake of preventing them from looking directly to that which 3 alone the object of their inquiry, name, whether this prisoner did conspire, will others, to destroy the king, when they to call a convention? And it matters ot whether this report of the secret commiliee be full of obnoxious and offensive resolutions; it matters not whether they are guilty of the other crimes in the catalogue of crimizal law: the sole question is, whether they hie been guilty of high treason? whethet Hef meant to call this convention for the purpot of deposing the king? And when you every one of the witnesses for the whether they had any such intention; i they tell you in plain direct words that Uey had uo such intention; that their views peaceable, and that they meant only top duce a parliamentary reform, by calling convention ; you are not to be led away by9 accumulation of all these acts (offensive, Pe haps, but not one of them amounting overt act of treason) to find the prt guilty of so high a crime, because you 4 prove of his politics, or because you dist}Pt of some of his conduct. ‘Thank God! i not the way in which a prisoner is to be in this country !—You are to keep your the fact with which he is charged, 0 inquire whether he is guilty of ten thos misdemeanors; whether he is obnoxios. this or that set of men; whether his int are such as you or I should approves whether he has been guilty of the crime iE which he stands charged, namely, when his project of a convention was directed immediately to the deposition of the king, and ; to be guilty of High treason, and ultimately to bis death, and if you do not find that, you cannot find the prisoner eet Gentlemen, I have already observed upon the miserable case that is made on the subject of arms, muskets, and pikes, and I am perfectly persuaded that that part of this case -would never have been laid before you, if 2 those who conduct this prosecution had not entertained a firm and certain opinion that without it they could do nothing ; such evi. dence weakens a strong case ; it is of a nature to add nothing to the strength of a case that could stand by itself; but we know very well that in a certain stage of a cause, when it is found that’ there is not sufficient to fix that charge upon the prisoner, without fixing which there must be a verdict of acquittal, any thing is attempted. Hence, arose the attempt to fix Mr. Hardy with the acts of Watt; one’s Mind revolts at it, and I am sure it would ; Rever have been attempted, if it had not been thought necessary to the support of this cause, Gentlemen, I told you before I had the ; best authority for saying that the delegates in Scotland, none at least of them but Watt and Downie, had been guilty of high treason. I have the best authority for saying that, because Lhave the authority of diisae who prosecuted them for a misdemeanor, and of the judges before whom they were convicted of a misde; Meanor. If they were known to be guilty of high treason, and yet were prosecuted for misdemeanors, it was not humanity so to Prosecute them ; true humanity is to be shown tothe innocent, and not to the guilty; the guilty should be punished up to the extent of their crimes, but if these men were known to be guilty of high treason, and yet were prosecuted only for misdemeanors, that prosecution becomes a snare to others; it holds out to them that acts of this sort are not high treason, it waits for their going on perhaps till they have accomplished the act, and then the net is thrown over them; they are told, this was a trap laid for you, we knew that those others had been uty of high treason, but we thought if we punished them as traitors, you would not gu on ; you have gone on, and now you must take the consequence; it is nothing to you how we proceed against other men; we will proceed against you as the law is—we will proceed against you for high treason, although we proceeded against them only for misdemeanors. I say that is not true humanity ; those persons who had been guilty of high treason should have been punished as traitors, and a trap should not have been laid for those who at that time were innocent of it; humanity should have been shown to those who had not been then guilty of crimes, and not to those who had. Ido not say that this was the conduct either of the prosecutors of these delegates, or of the judges who tried them; but I ain entitled from their conduct to assert this, that they did not believe them that they prosecuted them only for misdemeanors, because they knew them to be guilty only of misdemeanors. 
GIBBS 11674 Gentlemen, I have stated to you the ground upon which this prosecution is founded ; it is compassing the king’s death. I have stated to you that which I beg you always to hold in your minds, that the foundation of this prosecution is, that the prisoner called this convention for the purpose of deposing the king. I have stated to you that none of those acts which are contained in the volume of written evidence that has been laid before you, amount to proof of that fact. I should have stated before, it was an omission that I did not, but: I will now state to you what I apprehend to be the overt act charged in the indictment, and relied upon in proof as fixing this crime upon the prisoner; it consists in the resolution for calling a convention; the crime imputed is, that he resolved to call it for the purpose of deposing the king. 
GIBBS 11675 Now I beg you to hear the language of that resolution, as it was ultimately agreed to— “ That it appears to this committee very desirable thata general meeting, or Convention of the Friends of Liberty should be called, for the purpose of taking into consideration the proper methods of obtaining a full and fair representation of the people, that is the overt act with which the prisoneris charged. Wh, then, gentlemen, ihe professed and avow object of this convention by those who resolved that it should be called, was, not that it should take arms into its hands, not that it should entertain others who had arms in their hands, but merely that it should take into its consideration the proper methods of obtaining a full and fair representation of the people. This is the language which they hold throughout all their resolutions, and I insist that there is no direct evidence on the part of the crown which shows that this is a mere pretext. I shall come presently to that part of the case, and to the grounds there are for saying this was not a pretext; at present I am only considering how the evidence for the crown have made out their case; upon this part of the case you must believe, before you convict the prisoner, not only that there was force prepared, but that it was his intention that this convention should use that force. 
GIBBS 11676 Now a very remarkable observation that arises in the case is, that there is nota sin; le tittle of evidence from the beginning to the end which unites the project of the convention with any thing of arms, that connects or brings them together at all; they had spies upon all their proceedings—all their meetings were watched over—every member of the society had, when in the society, and robably at many other times, a man at his elbow who: would give an account of every thing that assed, and yet there is not a single word that has tallen fromany of the witnesses ; nota single expression, I believe, to be found in all: the written evidence, that connects the calling of the convention with the preparation of any force ; unless you connect the two together, you cannot find the prisoner guilty upon this charge in the indictment; there is no proo' which can be stated to you, none that can be left to your consideration without the parol evidence that these men intended that the convention should act by force; throughout the written evidence they expressly disavow it. 
GIBBS 11677 You must believe men’s words, unless the direct contrary is proved; but when the crown has given in evidence this business of arms, they tell you, and I am entitled to assume it, that this is the force which those members of the convention meant to use; if there was any other they would show it, and’ the conclusion follows, that if they did not mean to use this force, they meant to use’ 
GIBBS 11678 none. The crown knew all they had done; the question is, whether the convention meant to use force; if the crown cannot prove they Meant to use this force, they do not prove they meant to use any; the case would have been more strong, perhaps, upon that part of it, if they had not called their witnesses, because then you would have been told that a great deal was to be left to fair presumption and inference : that though they had not proved it, yet you were to presume it from the other facts proved ; but they have taken upon themselves to show you what that force was which this convention was to use, and they put it upon the pikes, the muskets, and the knives. Thee we have pretty well disposed of them 
GIBBS 11679 But supposing there was any thing serious in this proof of the pikes, the muskets, and the knives, there is no evidence connecting it with the convention; and if it had been the project of these people, if it had ever entered into the minds of any of them that this force should be used by that convention which they intended to call, it is impossible that the crown should not have been able to have laid evidence of it before you. You see they have spies every where; you see when we call a witness, they know him better than we do; they have had a man in every society in London. They can ask when Mr. Stevens was called, whether it was Mr. Stevens of Rathbone- place, or Mr. Stevens of the Minories. They know them all, they have watched at their elbows, they have been vigilant, and they are to be commended for it; ie still it fortifies my observation, that they know all that is in this case; that nothing is left to presumption, to inference ; that all that exists as been brought forward by them, and that you have nothing to form your judgment: upen, except that which they have laid before you; they have laid before you, therefore, all which exists of arms; they have laid nothing before you to show-that these arms were connected in- any way with the convention: ‘Therefore, I bave-a right to assume that the lise fact does not exist, that it ever wae nik contemplation of these men that thee am: should be so used; because if that had bese their contemplation, these men who tk of what they mean, would hy enough f talked of this, and it would have le: 
GIBBS 11680 known to the officers of the crown. Hor ublic has every thing been done whit iss been done? There is hardly a single x: of theirs imputed to them as a crime; one out of that number and variety of tte acts which are all woven up in this isinar web that is now spread before you; not which the prisoner, and those with when acted, have not publiely avowed in the fe of day. It may be said that if the acts illegal, this adds to their illegality ; that te: are not only illegal, but they are impute but that does not make them high tres: and it shows that what. these men profes were really their objects ; it shows that the acted bond fide; it shows that they thot they were about that which they hed nst todo, and that is the way in which usetk argument ; it shows that though they mitt be wrong, that though they might be eos; illegally, they thought they were ectiog k. gally, or they never would have submitted the investigation of courts: of justice, thet acts which are now complained of as consti ting the crime of high treason. Gentlemen, hitherto I have only remattd upon the evidence that has been produce the part of the crown; you observe it app from the language of our resolutions eer they have produced against us, that our ject was parliamentary reform; that langnt they say may have been a mere pretest, i may have covered a different desiz0. ee have it upon oath that this and nothing was the object of those people with wi they say we are connected, for every witit whom they have called, and who keer objects of those people, has sworn pares objects were peaceable. This is the e on the part of the crown. th Now, gentlemen, we have confirm ss evidence of the crown by evidence of our we have added to the number of wiuew whom the crown have called, others wirgia an account of what were the motives of iy societies, what was their end, 3 what means by which they meant to - ue end; every one of those witnesses, a we after another, has agreed in saying ths end was: a parliamentary reform, 29 call th to accomplish that end they meant (0 convention, yet it itever entered into minds to conceive that this conventt na to act by force; on the contrary, that tte to act by all peaceable means, to wetel voice of the country, and whe a os means of that convention, it was to eth by the same organ to the House of who it was supposed would listen 0"it Gentlemen, it would be idle 2 pat would be cruel towards you, td go cularly into the evidence than is necessary. 1 think I have stated what is the general effect of the evidence of every witness we have called; but I think there are two who were called last—I mean Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Francis, who spoke more particularly to this fact, 
GIBBS 11681 ‘ and whose evidence will deserve more of your consideration, because they show most decidedly that the objects the prisoner has always professed, were his real objects. Gentlemen, you recollect the time when there was an alarm in the kingdom, when the militia was suddenly embodied, and parlia Tent was assembled. Parliament was assembled, indeed, for the purpose of embodying the militia, because without it the militia 
GIBBS 11682  could not be embodied in a legal way; the ground alleged for calling ther was, that there were disturbances and insurrections in the kingdom; there were some gentlemen who thought that there did not at that time exist those disturbances and insurrections which were stated, and accordingly an inquiry was instituted into the real existence of them; upon that occasion Mr. Hardy attended Mr. Sheridan, and Mr. Sheristates to you in terms that Mr. Hardy arliament togewished a committee to be appointed; he wished an inquiry to be made, and he was 
GIBBS 11683 Yeady, and was to have laid before Mr. Sheri" dan, nay he was to have been called before the House of Commons, and to give an account there of all he knew relative to that business; be state! that their societies did meet at public-houses; that publicans, bably thinking their licences would be taken away, would not permit them to meet in their houses any more; that they had accordingly met at private houses; that he (Mr. Hardy) had communicated a list of these houses, and hadl given Mr. Sheridan all the information in his power ; that he wished an inquiry might be instituted, in order to show to the iament and the public what their real’ iee was: that he was ready to lay before them all the papers, all the documents relative to the prveress of this society. This seems te me to furnish extremely strong proof that Mr. Hardy acted bund fide; that he had then no criminal intent in his mind, nor had any of those acting with him, because if they had, he would have withdrawn from such an inquiry ; instead of that he comes forward publicly, deSires that an inquiry into their conduct may be institued, and he gave every assistance in his power for that purpose. Eappeass from Mr. Francis’s evidence, that what Mr. Hardy says has always been his object, always was so; he and some other members of this society attended Mr. Francis, wishing him to pace a petition to parliament, for annual parliaments and universal suffrage. Mr. Francis says, Mr. Hardy struck him, particularly from his deies, as areasonable, quiet man. Mr. heridan likewise gave that testimony to his tex: he says he remarked him for his peaceable and decent deportment ; thet come ing to him to desire him to present this peti tion, he conversed with them upon the subject; and they said then, what they now sayy notwithstanding this sent prosecution against them, that they learned their principles from the duke of Richmond’s letter that they were convinced by his arguments ; and I am afraid that they still hold the same opinions. I hope it is no reflexion upon any. man, not to entertain these vpinions; for I do not myself; yet still it is surely am excuse to such a man as Mr. Hardy, that he, holds opinions such as the duke of Rich mond entertains, and not only entertains, but has given to the ae as his opinions, and acted upon himself. They adhered to their object, Mr. Francis says, of poiversak suffrage; he stated to them, that that wag net the usual form of a petition, and they had better leave it to the House, what sort of reform should be adopted. They still, Mr. Francis says, adhered to their object; but they were ready, if, according to the forms of the House, it was more respectful, to leave the whole to the wisdum of tha House of Commons, what means they should adopt; they were ready to pregent their Petition in the general form; but still they adhered to their principle, that what they wished for was universal suffrage. Surely this must show, beyond doubt, that these men really thought it would be good thing to obtain universal suffrage, and that this was the object, and the only object which they i , and bone fide pursued. 
GIBBS 11684 But, gentlemen, those who conduct this prosecution wish to persuade you that there’ 18 more in it tham lies upon the surface; that these men have not acted honestly; that they have not acted bond fide; that this which they have held out as their object, and this which they have held out as their means of obtaining that object, are a mere pretext, and that there is no colour for insisting thet they are their real opinions
GIBBS 11686 Now, let'us examine it’ in its parts.—The first proposition is, that the House of Comfons is corrupt—I do not mean to say that the House of Commons is corrupt; but I am examining whether Mr. Hardy, who has inned his faith upon the duke of Richraond, as not ground for saying so, and that that eorruption proceeds from the want ofa proper representation of the people in the House of Commons. What does the duke of Richmond say upon that subject 
GIBBS 11688 he remedy, then, that is to be applied to this, is, in the opinion of Mr. Hardy and his friends, annual parliaments and universal suffrage. Why, what does the duke of Richmond say upon that subject Hle says, 
GIBBS 11689 “From every day’s experience to the present hour, I am more and more convinced, that the restoring the right of voting universally to every man not incapacitated by nature for want of reason, or by law by the commission of crimes, together with annual elections, is the only retorm that can be effectual and permanent: I am further convinced that it is the only reform that is practicable. 
GIBBS 11690 “ All other plans that are of a palliative nature, have: been found insufficient to interest and animate the body of the people, from whose earnestness alone any reform can be expected
GIBBS 11692 Now it is objected to Mr. Hardy, that ths idea of the corruption of the House of Com Mons; corruption proceeding from sn mproper representation there—that this idea of referming parliament by annual election, 's all pretext. What foundation is there fr that, when you have heard from twenty wit nesses im the cause, that Mr. Hardy has over and over again said, he forms himself upor the: duke of Richmond’s plan, which be wishes to be carried into execution ; that tht is his only object; and when this, which ke pretences in all his letters, which appears in fact the object he is pursuing, 3s, it terms, the reform which the duke ef Richmond by a publication recommends to tte people to ban ? hen, gentlemen, we have got this length 
GIBBS 11693 —that the corruption of parliament is pots thought of Mr. Hardy’s—that the cause of that corruption is net a thought of Mr. Hady’s—that the means by which that comuption might be remedied is not a thought of Mr. Hardy's; they are all the thoughts of the duke of Richmond, supported by these ret sons which you heard read while his gree was in court.—I have stated to you what the immediate means were—annual parliaments, and universal suffrage—The next thing be considered is, how that reform was tobe effected.—Mr. Hardy thinks—but that is ss to be pretext—that it may be effected, and he meant to effect it, by a convention of the peo le, and by collecting the sense of the peope rom that convention.—What does the dake of Richmond say upon that subject
GIBBS 11695  ne that it is fromthe people at large only that he expects it will be obtained, how is this man at the bar to understand the duke of Richmond
GIBBS 11697 ; at large the duke of Richmond ex hopes aM a at ts this reform—he does not expect it from the parliament—he knows the parliament will not t it? but he expects it from the people
GIBBS 11699 hen the people must have some lawful means of promoting it
GIBBS 11701 ‘ mond could never mean that ; but he expected this refurm from the people at large, because he hoped that they would declare publicly what their wishes were, and that those wishes being communicated to the House of Commons, would produce the reform which he wished to see effected. 
GIBBS 11702 Gentlemen, I think this ie fair reasoning ; I think this must be the construction which 
GIBBS 11703 ‘ou will put upon the duke of Richmond's tter: It cannot be said that a man possessing so enlightened a mind, and holding sucha rank in the state, as the noble duke, meant by this letter to colonel Sharman, to incite the people to take up arms against their government, and to enforce that which would otherwise be denied to them. He must be understood, therefore, to have -expected that the people at large, by-their opinions being collected, and those opinions being communicated to the legislature, would produce that reform for which be was so zealous au ad
GIBBS 11704 ‘vocate, 
GIBBS 11705 What, then, has deen the conduct of the prisoner, as testified by every part of the evidence in this cause
GIBBS 11707 Gentlemen, it is a principle, I. think, in the English law, that, when the act-of a man is indifferent or doubtful, it should rather be attributed to an innocent than a guilty motive, —And I hope that we have not lost sight of another principle by which English juries have always been governed ; namely, that if the act of a man be in itself indifferent, and there be evidence, some having a tendency to show it criminal, and some innocent, if the former does not most clearly overweigh the latter, humanity will turn the scale in favour of innocence, 
GIBBS 11708 With respect to this act of calling a convention, it being in its nature an innocent act, you heard read a protest of several learncd, peers upon a motion that was made in the House of Lords during the pressure of the American waz, when the burthens which that war produced were felt heavily by the subject. Lord Shelburne made a motion in the [louse of Lords, the ultimate object of which was to decrease those burthens; the immediate object was, that a committee should be called, consisting neither of placemen nor of pensioners, to inquire what unnecessary expenses arose in the public expenditure—what unnecessary places existed — what unnecessary ensions had been granted —and to inquire ow that expenditure might be lessened. 
GIBBS 11709 After a long debate, the motion was negatived ; but those who were in the minority, if they were weighed not by their number but by their merits, would be called a majority: There was at their head the venerable and learned earl Camden, as great a constitutional lawyer as this country has ever seen, and as firm a supporter of its constitution
GIBBS 11711 “ We are further impelled to press this motion, because the object of it has been secunded and called for by a considerable majority of the people, who are associating for is purpose, and seem determined to pursue 
GIBBS 11712 4 by every legal and constitutional method that can be devised for its success
GIBBS 11714 Then this learned and noble lord asserts the collecting the sense of the people at large to be the object of the associations of the people; that the object of those associations is, to communicate te the whole body of the representatives what are the opinions of the whole body of their constituents
GIBBS 11716 Gentlemen, is that illegal to which lord Camden, so great a lawyer, gives such an effect, when he states, that petitions offered by the general associations of the people, ought to be attended toby the House of Commons, and that it is inconsistent with their wisdom to reject them? Does not he, by this protest, hold out to the public, that, when separate petitions are rejected, the object of which is thought conducive to the public good, it is the right of the people to associate for that public good, and, being associated, to present such petitions as lord Camden tells them are not likely to be rejected? 
GIBBS 11717 “It is admitted that the House of Con. mons have a power to vote as they think f, but it is not possible to conceive that so wae an assembly will ever be rash enough tore ject such petitions, and by that means cane this dangerous question to be broached ad agitated whether they have not broke they trust? The voice of the people will certainly be complied with; ministers may, as they seen to have done in a recent instance, departany man of what he holds, at their pleasur, for presuming to exercise his undoubted ngt! of thinking for himself on these and o public subjects, but it will not be wis a them to treat these associations with ce. tempt, or call them by the invidious name a faction, a name by which the minority of both Houses of Parliament have been so iruently and s0 falsely calumniated, becas: the name sd applied, will recoil back ups themselves, when acting against the gener! sense of the nation, nor will they be able represent these numbers, so respectable a rank and property, as they did but too succesfully the discontented Americans, as a mb of indigent and seditious incendiaries, becaxe the people to whom this is addressed, are the very people that are abused, and every ma bears within himself the testimony of i falsehood. .. 
GIBBS 11718 Gentlemen, my reason for bringing forward this protest to you is, that you may seeit has been the opinion of great and enlighened men in this country, that associations of the people for the purpose of obtaining that which they conceive to be a redress of 3 national grievance, are not only lawful bit commendable ; for if they were only strictly lawful, and were not commendable, we s! not see the names ef such men as we doaat the bottom of this protest, publicly decar ing, that, because this appeared to be the voice of the people collected in their assoc tions, therefore it was incensistent with tbe wisdom of the House of Commons to rejed the prayer of these petitions. a 
GIBBS 11719 Now, gentlemen, if this be so—if this man at the bar has always acted upon the dake of Richmond’s plan—if the duke of Richmol has conianily pointed out to him ip all bs publications (it is not necessary for me Into more than that which I have stated) tha there exists this corruption in the state, may be remedied by these means—that th people have a right to act for themselves a the way I have stated ; if it be the opin men so eminent as those, whose nsmes Yo haye heard are at the bottom of this proiesy that associations of this sort ought to be tended to, how is the prisoner implicated ia any guilt charged upon him in this ment? Recollect the principle whieh I bere stated, and which cannot, I am sure, F that if you can attribute his actions to 2 BS Motive, you ought not to ascribe to a criminal one—I defy any man SY: that. there is direct proof, pesoom that the prepared any force for pad ya this convention ; and then if you find he ries constant} 
GIBBS 11720 declared that he followed plans of a dif3 ferent nature, if you find that general associations for such a purpose are lawful, how can you say, that he who projected only the calling a convention, for the purpose of parkamentary reform—who states, that it was for the purpose of takin: 
GIBBS 11721 into consideration the proper modes for obtaining a full and fair representation of the people
GIBBS 11723 —against the doctrine laid down in this protest, that associations for this purpose are legal and constitutional? How can you presume against all this, that his conduct was 
GIBBS 11724 Not legal and constitutional, though he always professed to follow the examples of men who acted legally and constitutionally ; though he professes in his resolutions to follow them only by legal and constitutional means? How can you presume that he had that illegal intent which the indictment charges him with, namely, that he called this convention for the purpose, by force of arms, of deposing the king, and putting him to death; that would not be a charitable conclusion — it would not be a conclusion to which Englishmen have ever upon such evidence arrived, and I am sure therefore that it will not be yours. 
GIBBS 11725 Let me suppose for a moment, that that noble person who has given his evidence in this cause, could descend from his high station, and become the advocate of this prisoner. What would he have had to say in his defence? would he not say, “ Look to the ay of this; it was my plan, he is my disaple, he has followed my doctrine, he has pend my principles by the means which pointed out to him; I told the public that annual parliaments and universal suffrage, was the only reform to be introduced into the House of Commons, which would remove the grievances under which we labour —J told the public, that they had a right to assemble, and to make their voice heard in the House of Commons; I not only told the public this at the time when I brought forward my motion, but I left with the public the reasons which induced me to form this Opinion, and these reasons have since been Operating upon the mind of this man at the bar—his sins, if he has sinned, are upon my head; if he has been misled, he has been misled by me, he has pursued the same object, by the same means; but (it is said) he’ 
GIBBS 11726 has used harsh language, he has entered into Improvident resolutions. Why he may; he 18 an ignorant man; his resolutions may have been improvident; may have been rash; may have been illegal; his language may have been so—but when I have af him to this; when I gave him the principle; when his end is the same as mine; when the means he uses are the same: namely, by the intervention of the Peon 3 a little indiscretion ; a little violence of language, and even a little illegality, is to be excused in a man in his situation. 
GIBBS 11727 “ I have high rank in the state; I have the advantages of great abilities ; t industry ; education; experience; knowledge; and an enlightened mind to direct me; I used them all, endeavouring to lead my judgment to a true conclusion, upon what was really salutary to the public upon this subject; they led me to conclude, that annual parliaments and universal suffrage, were the only means by which the public could be saved ; and led me also to conclude, that the people had a right to annual parliaments and universal suffrage ; and that if the House of Commons did net grant them upon private petitions, that to the people was the proper appeal, and the people would then make their own voice heard the House of Commons; this I told the poor man ; he learned it from me; he has not my advan ; with all these advantages I entertained the opinion which this man, who has none of them, following me entertains; he has on his side nothing but i ces it is not wonderful that he should have beenconvinced by the reasons whieh I published, and which induced me to entertain this opinion of a convention of the people, nothin on the other side ‘having been published, which could come into his hand: therefore surely it is reasonable to expect that you will presume he has acted bone fide. 
GIBBS 11728 “ But he has gone greater lengths than I have; well, that ma excused in him; he is an ignorant man, he has not the advantages Thave; he has not had the advice I might have to follow; he has met, too, with greater prsroctions than I ever met with; J had a rge train of followers in the House of Lords; the propositions which I brought forward, were never rejected with disdain end contumely; I had never the provocation that this man has had from the treatment that he has received ; I will not inquire whether the. provocation be well or ill founded, but it is still provocation which a eommon mind was likely to be moved by. 
GIBBS 11729 Gentlemen, these are the lope which the duke of Richmond himself, if he could be placed in my situation, and argue the case of the prisoner, would urge to you; but if he felt for a moment that this man’s life was in danger, his blood would eurdle in his veins; he would shudder at the mischiefs produced by his publication, and wish in vain to recall it; he would implore you upon his knees, not to find any guilt in Mr. Hardy, that you would not be ready to find in him; he would tell yor that the prisoner has done neing which is not imputable to him, nothing whic! he would not have done himself; his principles are the same, his objects the same ; that the means of attaining these objects avowed by him, and proved in this cause, are, tention you will pay te his lordship, when te the same; nota single expression has been| comes to sum up, for distinguishing bow proved upon Mr. Hardy, tending a different way, and surely, gentlemen, it is a great excuse for a man in the situation oflife in which the prisoner stands, to urge that he followed the same object which the duke of Richmond points out by the same means: I say by the same means, because it is not proved by that plain direct and manifest proof which the statute calls for, and which lord Coke says is tequired, that he has used any other; then penn me to add that the circumstance of his ing always avowed an adherence to the plan of the duke of Richmond, ought to lead you to a conclusion that in this case he mean Rot to go beyond it1. 
GIBBS 11730 Gentlemen, what I have troubled you with hitherto, is chiefly upon the general evidence of the plan that has been laid before you. 
GIBBS 11731 Gentlemen, you collected from an argument which we had in the early part of this cause, that none of the evidence admitted in it, which is not brought personally home to Mr. Hardy, ought at all to affect him, otherwise than as it it may prove (which was the object of it) a general conspiracy in the coun‘try to call together a convention, which was to be supported by force against the government; with that view nine-tenths of the evidence that has been read was admitted, and with that view only; and it was stated by the Court, that Mr. Hardy was not to be affected by any of that evidence, any farther than he might be proved afterwards to be engaged in that plot, and to the extent only that he was proved to be engaged init; namely, in the plot of calling together a convention for the purpose of attaining their end against the government, by force of arms, re is proof enough to show that Mr. Hardy did mean that a convention should be called; he certainly did, and I do not dispute it, but the question for you will be, whether Mr. Hardy, the individual standing at your bar, did in his mind intend that that convention should act by force against the government. 
GIBBS 11732 Now, gentlemen, wish it-were within the compass of my ability to have separated the evidence, and to have laid distinctly before you, what evidence does apply to Mr. Hardy, upon this point.. I admit that his case refe it. Iadmit that his counsel ought to lo it; and I have but one excuse for not doing it, which is, that to the reach of my ability, the thing was impossible; though I have had the accidental leisure of a Sunday to look into the papers 5 yet from not having a copy of a third part of the letters that have been produced in evidence, except those which are in the report (and I do not mean to blame any one thatI have them not) though I endeavoured to do it. I wasted a considerable pore tion of my time, and I found it, at last, absolutely impracticable. I must, therefore, leave itto you. I trust to your recollection, to the notes which you have taken, and to the atmuch of this affects Mr. Hardy. In my4prehension, none of it goes to show, that m is mind, there existed a design of effecting s pert in the parliamentary representatioc, yy force. 
GIBBS 11733 You observe, gentlemen, that, in the forms part of my argument, I contended, that thee existed no such design; if there did, whet is another fae of my argument, there is 2 colour for fixing any thing, as it seems to me, ‘apon Mr. ly, the prisoner. gentlemen, it is in evidence to you, that Mr. Hardy bas never been without a spy at his elbow for the last two years, from the year 1792 tll the time that he was apprehended ; he bas never been at any meeting, he has never been with any assembly of friends at which there wa not present some person who has carried the ears of government every thing that wis said, by every person, at these meetings. Is it not singular then, that with the disposition which these men had to produce a reform (3 I admit they had) that not one single expr sion, upon any occasion, is proved to bare dropped from the mouth of Hardy, showing disrespect either to the King, oy to the Lords? But I would not rely much upon that : Isit not aleo singular, that not even an hasty epressions nut an accidental word, has ever fallen from him, to show, that it ever was if his contemplesis to use force for any pupose? And is it possible, that if he had conceived in his mind a design of carrying the project of that convention by force, walt as he has been, with spies constantly about him, some unguarded word should not at some time or other, have fallen from him, indicating, that be had entertained such an intention’ You will observe, that though it is 8 pat of bid evi enes of the crown to show fe Sie lot, and, for that purpose, they have jor general avnletins, vas you have another uestion to try; you are to say, notonly whe ther there was any such plot; but, if ther was, whether Hardy was an actor in it, embraced, in his mind, all its criminal views? For you are trying his intentions in calling this convention, whether it was the object o! his mind, that, when called, it should act by force? No matter who meant it, if be not; if that was not the intention of Mr. Hardy, you cannot find him guilty ; andi it was his intention, I do think it utterly impo sible, that going into the history of his lie for two years, going into every aet of it, tending him at every meeting that be ee attended, with spies whose ears were one upon all occasions, it is utterly impossible ad think, that some expression, some gus! word, should not have fallen from him sm ing that this was his intention. No such is proved to have fallen from him; 00 ression from which it can be presumed, be entertained such an idea. Is this en ding to the cofumon course of human «io 
GIBBS 11734 Does the hisfory 6f human life furnish you with a single instance of a man, having a certain plan in his mind, for two years together, meeting persons, with whom he is supposed to have been associated for the purpose of carrying that plan into execution, conversing with them upon the subject which would naturally lead to it, with the utmost freedom,— Supposing himself not watched; supposing himself to be talking with men, in whom he might repose the most certain confidence; do you find any instance, in the history of human nature, that a man the most artful and wily, through the course of two whole years, has never in confidence dropt an expression, showing he entertained that design which was lurking in his heart? Does the history ef human nature furnish you with such an instance? And, if it docs not, surely your humanity, your good nature will lead you to say, that it bas not existed, for the first time, in this unfortunate man at the bar. Gentlemen, you are trying an act of his mind; you are trying whether it was Ais intention to compass this end by force; if it were not, whether such was the intention of any other person is immaterial. Then, if he has never suffered to escape from him an expression, feom which that can be collected; if all that has fallen from his lips, for the last two years, ‘bas been communicated to those who accuse him, being, as he supposed himself always to be, in company with friends andconfidents, when he was in company with spies, surely it is too hard to say, that he entertained in his mind, during all this time, a project, fconcerning which he never uttered a syllable, even to those with whom it is pretended that he conspired ; that is too much for human credulity to give faith to. , If Mr. Hardy were a man of profligate man‘Bers and dissipated life; if he were a man likely, from the tenor of his conduct, to rush into a plan of this sort; if I could presume, from his general habits, that he was disposed to entertainand to pursue violent objects, by Violent means, there might be something in this case. But you have heard the character that has been given of him; I think I never heard so universal and complete a character iven by 90 many persons, of an individual in is situation, in my life. All sorts of persons have been called to you ; his neighbours ; his friends; those with whom he fived in intiMacy; those of the same business with himself; some his countrymen ; some not; all of them, concur in saying, that he isa man of the most amiable disposition, and respectable character; that he is a man of the most peaceable mind; that he is the last man in the world whom they should ever think capable of entertaining such a project as is now imputed to him.‘The minister whom he attends has been called; he not only says, that his conduct in life has been exemplary, his manners amiable 
GIBBS 11735 4nd peaceable, but he tells you, that conversing with him upon political subject, he enSeatourel to draw fear him what his object was, and the means by which he meant to attain that object; that he always told him, it was parliamentary reform, upon the duke of Richmond’s plan, and that the means by which he meant to obtain that object were peaceable. You observe, that these witnesses whom we called to his character, were not all eople of his way of thinking, but that some fad differed with him in politics. I believe that is in evidence. I know, however, the fact tobe so. They all concurred in saying, that, during all the time they have known him, some for twenty years, his masters whom he served, all concurred in saying, a better character never belonged to man. 
GIBBS 11736 Gentlemen, this is a case in which, of all others, a Pane character ought to weigh; because this is a case in which you are trying the act of the prisoner’s mind; in which you are trying, whether he had conspired with others to pull down this government by torce? Whether he was ready to take arms in his own hand, and attack the established powers of the country? That is the question you are to try; and, if you find any thing short of that; if youdo not find that it was the design of Mr. Hardy to attack the government by force, through the means of a convention, it is impossible you should find him guilty. 
GIBBS 11737 Then, gentlemen, surely this character ought to weigh; surely a man of such peaceable manners as belong to him, ought not lightly to be presumed capable of such an act; and when you add, too, that his conduct has been most diligently scrutinized, for two years, ina manner which no man could be aware of; when you find, that they are acquainted with every thought of his mind, that has found expression by his tongue, and that no word has ever fallen from him indicating a criminal intention, it is not too much to expect you to say, that, whatever other men may have intended upon this subject, he had not those views which are imputed to him, and therefore ought to have your verdict in his favour. 
GIBBS 11738 Gentlemen, let me remind you again of what the point is which you have to try; it is, whether Mr. Hardy, at the time he cont curred in the resolution for calling this cone vention, did himself personally mean, that the convention, being called, should act by force of arms against the government? That is the joint which you have to try
