GREEN 7619 Yes; I have one in my pocket—Here it is producing it.] 
GREEN 7621 Yes; I have had one of the kind seven years, and used it in my business. 
GREEN 7623 Yes, and cheese, or any thing. 
GREEN 7625 Never. 
GREEN 7627 I have twenty left out of three dozen. 
GREEN 7629 Yes,. 
GREEN 7631 Very few that are any thing of a cutler’s shop. 
GREEN 7633 They are no new discovery ; I have used them seven years. 
GREEN 7635 Yes. 
GREEN 7637 Yes. 
GREEN 7639 I do, 
GREEN 7641 He came to me to purchase 3 knite at my shop, among other things; he purchased several other articles at the same time; he remarked the utility of the knife; he said it was a very useful knife. ‘ 
GREEN 7643 No. 
GREEN 7645 I did not mention any particular number; I remember he madea remark in this kind of way, whether I had sold a number of these knives, whether it was a saleable article or no?—I said, yes.—No man in business would tell a person that it was not a saleable article; they would not purchase it, if he did. 
GREEN 7647 I will make oath that I did not make use of such an expression as that. 
GREEN 7649 I do not know exactly what, but not such a one as that; no man has ever heard me swear an oath in that kind of way these seven years; I might make use of an expression in this kind of way, when he asked me if it wasa saleable article, and if I sold a uantity of them, I might say yes, it is a saleable article, or to that purpose, but I did not say that I had sold any particular number. 
GREEN 7651 No. 
GREEN 7653 Not at 
GREEN 7655 I do. 
GREEN 7657 I swear I said ho such thing; these knives all lay open in my shop, so far from hiding them from my wife, or from any man in the parish, thatthey lay openly in the show-glass, and in the window for sale. 
GREEN 7659 Not if I knew it was intended to be made use of for that purpose. 
GREEN 7661 In the ordinary course of my trade. 
GREEN 7664 What he has sworn I do not know, ‘but that Idid not make use of such an expression, I swear positively. 
GREEN 7666 I do not recollect that I said a word of the kind, or throw out any such hint. 
GREEN 7668 I do not recollect, to the best of my knowledge, that I mentioned any thing about my wife. “Did you mention any t ing about aristocrat?—No, I do not know t at I said any thing about aristocrat, or my wife. 
GREEN 7670 No. 
GREEN 7672 I beg leave, with submission to the Court, to know, whether I am bound to aoswer that question ? 
GREEN 7675 I fo not ask you whether you did print it or not.—I had. 
GREEN 7677 A person of the name of FPiodgson. 
GREEN 7679 I never was in his hhouse—I was informed he lived at Westminster. 
GREEN 7681 I presume it must be about the month of March last. 
GREEN 7684 A manuscript. 
GREEN 7686 Yes. 
GREEN 7691 I presume about the month of March. 
GREEN 7695 A member of the London Corresponding Society. 
GREEN 7697 I presume I was a member about three months—then I ceased to be a member. 
GREEN 7699 Immediately upon the report that the society had improper objects in view. 
GREEN 7701 About the month of April, on the first apprehension, I believe, of the prisoner and Mr. Adams; I never went to the society afterwards. 
GREEN 7703 Never. 
GREEN 7705 Never. 
GREEN 7707 In the Commons House of Parliament. 
GREEN 7709 Far from it. 
GREEN 7711 Far from it; I never heard any thing of the kind started directly nor indirectly. Had you any reason to suspect that they meant to displace the Lords from any authority they possess in the state ?—None at all ; I am sure I should not have continued with them a moment longer if I had. 
GREEN 7713 Intirely from Hardy and Adams being taken ups and the reports in circulation, that, under the pretence of a reform, they were pursuing other objects. 
GREEN 7715 No; I did not by any means, for my business would not admit of it, and a part of the three months that I was a member I was indisposed and confined to my room. 
GREEN 7717 Exactly. 
GREEN 7719 At the time 1 was in the society, I always understood when they were talking of aconvention, as a thing by no means determined on; that they wished to take the sense of different societies in the country, whether such a measure was adviseable, the assembling a convention. 
GREEN 7721 Oh—by no means, there was not the least shadow to form such an opinion from. 
GREEN 7723 Never in my life. 
GREEN 7725 No. 
GREEN 7727 No; I had not. 
GREEN 7729 I believe in the month of March or April; I am not accurate as to the time; it must be about that time, for I did not become a member of the society till the month of February, I believe.
