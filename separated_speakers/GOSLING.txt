GOSLING 5313 Edward. 
GOSLING 5315 Yes. 
GOSLING 5317 Yes. 
GOSLING 5319 At present I am employed by Mr. Wickham. 
GOSLING 5322 Both in Fis private business and on his public business. 
GOSLING 5324 No, a magistrate in Worship-street. 
GOSLING 5326 About September last, but that was only occasionally. 
GOSLING 5328 Before that I kept a broker’s shop. 
GOSLING 5330 I never in my life, upon my oath, to my knowledge, bought a store that ever was the property of his majesty, if that is what you mean. 
GOSLING 5332 I know the reason for which it was put; and it is a question which if I was notconscious of my innocence, I has noright to answer, butasI knew I could safely do it, I thought it proper to answer. 
GOSLING 5334 I did say the direct contrary; I was asked by Mr. Worship, when I went to buy a print what I was? and what my address was? as I conceived he would not 
GOSLING 5337 Never to my knowledge; 
GOSLING 5340 Never upon my oath. 
GOSLING 5342 I have not; and as means were yesterday used to deter me from giving evidence, I am willing to explain them, and am willing to explain why I went by another name ; as I find every advantage is wished to be taken of me, I trust the mercy of the Court will not suffer any improper question to be put to me. 
GOSLING 5345 I did 
GOSLING 5347 I believe as much as ten years since. 
GOSLING 5350 I would wish to relate the circumstances under which I took that name. 
GOSLING 5353 In Westminster. Where in Westmirister ?—In Petty France, 
GOSLING 5356 It is about ten years since; I do not know that I could state exactly the time ; I believe, it must be about the year 1784. 
GOSLING 5359 That was the reason that struck me at that time, and I had no thought of continuing under that name. 
GOSLING 5361 I continued near seven years in that name, and it was from this circumstance. 
GOSLING 5363 I do, I did not recollect him, but I wish to state some circumstance. 
GOSLING 5365 I do. 
GOSLING 5367 Mr. Lincoln I understand to be something to Mr. Macnamara; be collects rents for him, I believe. 
GOSLING 5369 I did, and will state the circumstances if you please. 
GOSLING 5371 I am Upon my oath, I do not know the particular gum, nor cannot state the particular time; -I believe it is four or five years ago. 
GOSLING 5373 Ten pound, or guieas, I do not know which. 
GOSLING 5375 Yes, in the name of George Douglas, part of which 1 
GOSLING 5378 I cannot state the time. 
GOSLING 5381 I was, m Mr. Macnamara’s conduct to me, so confused, that I hardly knew what I said. 
GOSLING 5383 I declare, I did not recollect Mr. Lincoln’s person, having never seen him but once or twice in my life. 
GOSLING 5385 I certainly did say 50, 
GOSLING 5387 He did not. When he came up, he asked me first what my name was? I said, Edward Gosling; said he, did you never go by any other name? did not you rent a house of me? my name is Macnamara ; J said, this is not a place proper for explanation; he said, I came out of bumanity to you, know you gavea note to Mr. Lincoln, some part of which is not paid, and I only came out of humanity to you to inform you, that when you appear in evidence this will be brought forward. 
GOSLING 5389 This note would be produced. I told him I had not the money. I offered Mr. Lincoln the money afterwards. 
GOSLING 5391 I knew where he lived at the time I borrowed it; I do not know whether Mr. Lincola had moved or not. 
GOSLING 5393 I paida part of the money, and my wife paid another partofit. It was to be paid by instalments. 
GOSLING 5395 Because I thought that would preclude all inquiry; because I did not choose to give him my address; because thought if he found I was with Mr. Wickham, he would refuse then to let me have what I wanted. 
GOSLING 5397 Yes; I saw he suspected I was not friendly to their cause. 
GOSLING 5399 A secretary of a division of the Corresponding Society. 
GOSLING 5401 Never in my life. 
GOSLING 5403 Never, 
GOSLING 5405 The only thing I ever did, I will state: that, on the Tuesday, after the apprehension of Hardy, I mentioned what had passed at the division, in Comptonstrect, relative to the committee of emergency, and to know whether it was their intention to do the same. 
GOSLING 5407 I never wished, and do not to my knowledge know, thatever used any one expression of the kind; in some respects I may have appeared to have approved of their proceedings with the view which was my sole design. I did not wishto lead Baxteron, nordid I find fault with him, from this circumstance, ‘that as I had reason to believe, thatarms were secreted, and it was my wish to discover where they were, that they might be found, and the mischief prevented. 
GOSLING 5409 I never did. 
GOSLING 5411 Yes. 
GOSLING 5413 No. 
GOSLING 5415 ] never made use of such an expression ever. 
GOSLING 5417 No, never to my knowledge, I never used any inflammatory expression, or any means to excite them to disturbance, or any means whatever. 
GOSLING 5419 I do not. 
GOSLING 5421 I donot know a Mrs. Coleman now. 
GOSLING 5423 T did. 
GOSLING 5425 Certainly, she rented a shop of me. 
GOSLING 5428 She died at my house, and I buried her. 
GOSLING 5430 Yes. 
GOSLING 5432 Her property was partly left to one Burroughs, and ay to one James Leech. 
GOSLING 5434 I wrote it. Do you know Mrs. Biffin ?—I do not. 
GOSLING 5437 How ill used? 
GOSLING 5439 None at all, I was-in no trouble about it. 
GOSLING 5441 There was no just cause of comint. 
GOSLING 5443 I cannot say I recollect the particular circumstances that might pass, there was a brother by a former husband who came up out of the country. 
GOSLING 5445 I do not know that there was any complaint. 
GOSLING 5447 TI canna tell what complaints may have been made. 
GOSLING 5449 Never, that I know of. 
GOSLING 5451 I will swear I never heard any such thing. 
GOSLING 5453 A man who was formerly an apprentice, and kept a shcp nearly opposite, who set up in opposition to 
GOSLING 5455 In the same business of a hair-dresser. 
GOSLING 5457 I did not say she left her property to him. ‘ 
GOSLING 5459 I told pn to be divided equally between s person of the name of Burroughs, at Edmonton, and a James Leech. 
GOSLING 5461 No. 
GOSLING 5463 A son of my wife's 
GOSLING 5465 A cousin of her’s or some such tine. 
GOSLING 5467 I had no connexion, any farther than ren dering her every service in my power, during a long illness, in which I was at considerable expense. 
GOSLING 5469 I cannot tell exactly. 
GOSLING 5471 I cannot tell. 
GOSLING 5473 I do not know the time. on ittwo months ?—It was longer than at. 
GOSLING 5475 Longer than that. 
GOSLING 5477 I cannot state to a month. 
GOSLING 5479 It vas not. 
GOSLING 5481 Yes. 
GOSLING 5483 I swear, that to the best of my knowledge or recollectivn, I never heard such a thing. ‘ 
GOSLING 5485 I do not recollect that ever I was. 
GOSLING 5487 I do not know that I ever was. 
GOSLING 5489 I can swear no farther than, that tothe best of my knowledge, it never was. 
GOSLING 5491 it may be a fact within his knowledge, or it may not. 
GOSLING 5493 Never, to my knowlodge. 
GOSLING 5495 I do not recollect that any person ever did. 
GOSLING 5497 I can only speak to the best of my recollection and knowledge. 
GOSLING 5501 I never recollect that any person ever did. 
GOSLING 5504 I canne exactly state how long I have dealt with im. 
GOSLING 5506 In cheesemongery and butter, and things of that kind, and some hams. 
GOSLING 5508 Yes ; and to sell. 
GOSLING 5510 My wife kept a shop of that sort, and I dressed hair. 
GOSLING 5512 No. 
GOSLING 5514 I do not remember any thing else; if you name any co charge, if1t comes within my knowedge, I will own it. 
GOSLING 5517 I purchased hams of him, and in some there were great holes filled up with mortar and stones. 
GOSLING 5519 Some of them were. 
GOSLING 5521 Certainly ; he did not use me well when I was ignorant in the business. 
GOSLING 5529 W hat kind of stores? 
GOSLING 5531 I have purchased old cordage, bad sacking, and such Pind of things; but those I do not consider to come under the denomination of naval stores. 
GOSLING 5533 What is commonly called hand stufting, used for making of paper. 
GOSLING 5535 I never said that, I will relate to you one circumstance upon which that is taken : I wished to get information respecting them, and Mr. Colquhoun would give me credit for that; it was upon that very business I was taken into his employment to give intelligence respecting that, f understood from iliier that he had a relation who was a quarter-master there, and I wished, through his means, to obtain information for the service of government. 
GOSLING 5537 I told him I was a dealer in naval stores. 
GOSLING 5539 No, I did not tell him that. 
GOSLING 5541  Never. 
GOSLING 5546 I never had, to my knowledge, any charge brought against me for dishonesty for it, I obtained every infurmation I could to prevent children and other persons, that might be tempted to purloin things, the information was not given against any person, but merely hints to prevent piltering, no person was accused upon that pepmationy, nor did I receive any reward for it. 
GOSLING 5548 I did not tell Hillier I had been in a constant, course of cheating the king; he mentioned to me his having a relation a quarter-master at the yards, and to whom he talked of sending some of the resolutions; I thought that from him, as it is the quarter-master that puts up the stores, that I might obtain some information relative to those stores. 
GOSLING 5550 I did not tell him I had been in the course of cheating the king at all. 
GOSLING 5552 I only told him that I wasa dealer in naval stores, nothing farther. 
GOSLING 5554 Never, the manner in which it is conveyed out. 
GOSLING 5556 No; I have given information to Mr. Colquhoun. that copper has ‘been sent away, but that was not from the king’s stores ; but supposed to be copper fraudulently conveyed away. 
GOSLING 5559 I told him ‘a had heard such a seizure had been made, but I never saw the woman in my life; had heard of it, and merely related that I had heard that such a thing was the fact. 
GOSLING 5561 The 15th of April; upon the 14th, 
GOSLING 5564 I should not know his person again; I do not know that I did. 
GOSLING 5566 No, out in the grounds :in the crowd. 
GOSLING 5568 On the 15th of April. 
GOSLING 5570 At the Hope, in Northampton-street. 
GOSLING 5572 The Monday following, I believe. 
GOSLING 5574 I do not know that, I have not every paper with me. 
GOSLING 5576 On Monday following, I was at Morris's, in Brick-lane. 
GOSLING 5578 About twenty-five or twenty-six,Isuppose, 
GOSLING 5580 I knew the persons of some of them. 
GOSLING 5582 Bennet and Hillier; there were other persons, captain Williams, I believe, was there, an American. 
GOSLING 5584 On the Tuesday following, I was at the hope. 
GOSLING 5586 Hilher was there. 
GOSLING 5588 About seven or eight and twenty. 
GOSLING 5590 That night at Morris’s I did not hear any thing about arming. 
GOSLING 5592 The 22nd was the night when the delegate Wright made that observation, and the answer was given by Gordon, the secretary. 
GOSLING 5594 On the 29th of April, there was a conversation about arming. 
GOSLING 5596 That was not at a division, that was at Hillier’s house. 
GOSLING 5598 That was the 25th of April. 
GOSLING 5600 A man whose name Ewas tok! was Hicksley (who introduced the subject by saying he had received a letter from Sheffield), Hillier, Bennett, another person, whose name I do not know, and anether man who appeared to be in liquor 
GOSLING 5602 I have they are true. 
GOSLING 5604 I do. 
GOSLING 5607 At the Hope. 
GOSLING 5609 There were two divisions met there that night, No. 11, and No. 6. 
GOSLING 5611 I suppose about forty or fifty persons together. 
GOSLING 5613 There was a print proposed by Worship the engraver, and recommended to the use of the society. 
GOSLING 5615 No expression of overturning the government ; but it was recommended to them to learn the use of arms. 
GOSLING 5617 I do not recollect, that there was any particular se stated. 
GOSLING 5619 I have, at different times, ofwhich I have not the dates, heard other people speaking of it, and approving of it. Do you mean members of the society a?—Yes. What member ?—Birks, the same I saw at Chalk farm. 
GOSLING 5621 I do not know. 
GOSLING 5623 I do not recollect the particular conversation, because I did not minute the words, therefore I will not attempt to swear to the conversation; I: likewise heard a man of the name of ‘Kelly, and likewise I heard Eaton talk of arming. 
GOSLING 5625 I heard Kelly say so, after the apprehension of Hardy. 
GOSLING 5627 I believe this to be one of them; this was brought es a proof it was to be published the next day; 
GOSLING 5630 He mentioned, that they were Sans Culottes; and the caps on their heads were te be coloured red. 
GOSLING 5632  Yes. 
GOSLING 5634 I did. 
GOSLING 5636  I did. 
GOSLING 5638 I cannot exactly state the time; about four or five years. 
GOSLING 5640 To Mr. Lincoln.’ 
GOSLING 5642 Ten pounds, or ten guineas. 
GOSLING 5644 I believe three guineas. 
GOSLING 5646 I never saw Mr. Macnamara in my life before yesterday, not to know him. 
GOSLING 5648  Never. 
GOSLING 5650 I did not see him myself; I heard Mr. Lincoln had called upon me. 
GOSLING 5652 Three or four years ago. 
GOSLING 5654 I was sitting at dinner; a person came, and said, some person came to speak tome; I found Mr. Macnamara alone. 
GOSLING 5656 He said, that he was 2 man of property, and bad a large estate in the country; that he was a friend to the king and constitution ; that he would see strict justice done; and he came out of humanity to me to let me know, that this would be produced against me in court. 
GOSLING 5658 He did not say what. 
GOSLING 5661 None. 
GOSLING 5663 None. 
GOSLING 5665 Not that I know of; the brother came to town, and apy peared perfectly satisfied. 
GOSLING 5667 It was.
