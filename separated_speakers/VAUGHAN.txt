VAUGHAN 8919 I presume, my lord, as I have been personally alluded to, may be permitted to speak. I assure the attorney general, and the whole court, upon my honour, that [had none of the intentions, nor would have been guilty of the fact which he imputes to me; and the only circumstance which induced me to make one single observation is thisâ€”that Mr. Erskine and Mr. Gibbs did me the honour to desire that I would sit next them, because some months ago I was consulted upon the subject of this trial ; that being the case, many circumstances might occur to my recollection with which they might not be acquainted. 
VAUGHAN 8921 I certainly would not, my lord. If the Attorney general desires, I will remove to any other part of the court.
