SANDERSON 4885 In Butcher-row Temle- bar. 
SANDERSON 4887 Yes. 
SANDERSON 4889 Yes. 
SANDERSON 4891 I must refer to the notes I have, the memorandum I made. [lefers to his memorandum.) It was the znd of April. 
SANDERSON 4893 It was to decide a bet. 
SANDERSON 4895 I did. 
SANDERSON 4897 They belonged to the armed society. 
SANDERSON 4899 At Shelmerdine’s in the borough. 
SANDERSON 4901 A hatter. 
SANDERSON 4903 The second of April in the evening. 
SANDERSON 4906 I did not take particular notice, there might be seven or eight stand of arms there. 
SANDERSON 4908 I suppose of twenty-four or twenty-five members. 
SANDERSON 4910 I suppose they were, because they objected to my being of the armed association because I was not a member of the London Corresponding Society. I was made a member of the armed society upon a promise that I would become a member of the London Corresponding Society. 
SANDERSON 4912 I did. 
SANDERSON 4914 I think when I first met them at Shelmerdine’s there might be twenty-four or twenty-five: they did not all meet at Shelmerdine’s; we adjourned to another place; it was supposed to be dangerous to meet at Shelmerdine’s; the adjournment had been agreed upon before I came there; the greater part of the arms had been removed. 
SANDERSON 4916 We did not exercise there. 
SANDERSON 4918 We did not exercise there, we only adjourned there for the purpose of fixing upon a prope place to exercise in. 
SANDERSON 4920 The house was in Worcester-street. 
SANDERSON 4922 The same—we went up stairs, they mentioned then that the private committee of the armed society had fixed upon another place for exercising. 
SANDERSON 4924 I hey sat with the rest. 
SANDERSON 4926 Yes. 
SANDERSON 4928 One was at Spence’s, the other was in Westminster, just by ‘othil-fields Bridewell, at a blacksmith’s shed. 
SANDERSON 4930 Yes, I pretty constantly attended them; I went to Spence’s first; we met once or twice a weck. 
SANDERSON 4932 I called several times when there were none there; it was the 14th of November, I think, I first of all went; no ; it was on the 11th of April, the first time I went to Spence’s to exetcise; I continued to ga occasionally to Spence’s till May the 1st. 
SANDERSON 4934 I did. 
SANDERSON 4936  Formerly Williams; and Orr, from the 11th of April till May; on the first of May I took away my gun. What was the greatest number of persons you met, at either of those places, during the period you have mentioned f—I do not thmk we ever met above six. 
SANDERSON 4938 Yes. 
SANDERSON 4940 I believe a taylor. I have heard 90. 
SANDERSON 4942 He mentioned frequently in conversation, that he had served against the allied armies. 
SANDERSON 4944 He was a member of the Corresponding Society; he had served in the French army, from his own account. 
SANDERSON 4946 I did. 
SANDERSON 4948 He was a hatter, and frequently changed his men; and some of them, they observed, might not be staunch to the cause, and therefore it might be hazardous. 
SANDERSON 4950 IfI might judge from the conversation, it was to obtain a parliamentary reform, at the point of the bayonet. 
SANDERSON 4952 Yes. 
SANDERSON 4954 I never saw them. 
SANDERSON 4956 Part of them were; that we were to pay so much upon admission; one half of which was to buy arms, the other to defray the incidental expenses of the society. 
SANDERSON 4958 I was admitted member the same night Mr. Nodder was, and received a similar ticket. 
SANDERSON 4960 Yes. 
SANDERSON 4962 Yes, I perfectly well recollect the circumstance; it was in the month of May; I do not recollect the night. 
SANDERSON 4964 One of the members got up, and said, citizen|1. 
SANDERSON 4966 I do not know. 
SANDERSON 4969 Yes, at this meeting none were adadmitted but members. 
SANDERSON 4971 Citizens, Mr. Pitt will go over—I forget which of the bridges, but he mentioned one of the bridges, at twelve o’clock at night. 
SANDERSON 4973 None ; there was a general clap upon the table, and some said it was very improper to make any comments upon it. 
SANDERSON 4975  They mentioned the particular bridge, and on what occasion-he would be detained tilltwelve o'clock at night; 1 think it was Putney bridge, but do not recollect the bridge to a certainty. 
SANDERSON 4977 Yes; there was some good news announced that very night, as they termed it. 
SANDERSON 4979 A defeat of part of the British army; I do not recollect what. 
SANDERSON 4981 It was genetally so understood by the society. es that, so described, so announced ?—Yes. 
SANDERSON 4983 I do. 
SANDERSON 4985 That he had the pleasure to inform the socicty, that he heard one of the king’s messengers had been killed in the couniry. 
SANDERSON 4987 I remember the name of ciuzcu Lilgginsy Lut I do not recollect his person, 
SANDERSON 4989 I do recollect some observations, but cannot recollect the exact words ; but I think he said, if it had been his own father, or his own son, he should be glad, if he met with the same fate. 
SANDERSON 4991 The messenger. 
SANDERSON 4993 I do not know. 
SANDERSON 4995 I do not know; L do not know Higgins personally. 
SANDERSON 4997 It was frequently hinted to the members to be cautious, for fear of spies; to be careful what they said; for, in all divisions of the society, spies from the treasury would creep in. 
SANDERSON 4999 Yes; it was a proposal, that, as they might be prevented meeting in public houses, on account that their licences might be taken away, that they should be divided into tithings, that they might meet at the House of every tenth man. 
SANDERSON 5002 It was deferred for further consideration. 
SANDERSON 5004 Not in particular that I recollect; there was some one alluded to, but I did not understand who it was. 
SANDERSON 5006 One member observed, he should not regard blowing any spy’s brains out, if he discovered him. 
SANDERSON 5008 Yes. 
SANDERSON 5010 From Williams. 
SANDERSON 5012 No, I have not. 
SANDERSON 5014 Yes. 
SANDERSON 5016 I was., 
SANDERSON 5018 I was, 
SANDERSON 5020 Merely a memorandum of dates. 
SANDERSON 5022 I will be bound by it, upor my oath, as near as a man can be bound toa paper of dates. 
SANDERSON 5024 I think it was the 21st. 
SANDERSON 5027 I do not think, upon such an occasion, being a spy is any disgrace. 
SANDERSON 5034 When first I was introduced into the 13th division, was on the 21st of April, on a Monday. ‘ 
SANDERSON 5036 That was mentioned at the armed society. 
SANDERSON 5038 Yes; I never was there but once, therefore I could noe make an error in that; it was April the 2nd. 
SANDERSON 5040 At Day’s. 
SANDERSON 5042 In the Borough, near the Grove; I believe it is called Worcesterstreet. 
SANDERSON 5044 Some were going up stairs, and some going away; to the best of my recollection there might be twenty-two, twenty-three, or twenty-four; I did not count them, as I never expected to be called. 
SANDERSON 5046 I had every reason to suppose I should not be called. 
SANDERSON 5048 It seemed to be the opinion of the whole company, that a parliamentary reform could not be obtained, but at the point of the bayonet. 
SANDERSON 5050 Yes; from their general conversation. 
SANDERSON 5052 Yes. 
SANDERSON 5054 The reason of my going there was to decide a bet ; that was the way I first came to go there. 
SANDERSON 5056 I did. 
SANDERSON 5058 I did. 
SANDERSON 5060 I did. 
SANDERSON 5062 When I once discovered, that an armed society of this sort existed, which I thought of such dangerous tendency, I immediately gave notice to the secretary of state. 
SANDERSON 5064 Between two and three days; but I mentioned it before that bet was decided, that, if I lost my bet,. should certainly acquaint the se-cretary of state. 
SANDERSON 5066 I should, of two or three of them. 
SANDERSON 5068 I do not think I should; I know the person in the chair, Orr. 
SANDERSON 5070 He was. 
SANDERSON 5072 I think Williams was there; but I did nut, expect to see sucha thing; I was very much flurried and confused. 
SANDERSON 5074 I became a member on the 5th of April, 
SANDERSON 5076 April, 1794. 
SANDERSON 5078 I had not been directed to become a member, in consequence of the recommendation of any magistrate ; I had been unexpectedly proposed by Whittam, and a magistrate had told me, if another person had proposed me. I should become a member, : 
SANDERSON 5080 Not respecting the Corresponding Society. 
SANDERSON 5082 John Hillier. 
SANDERSON 5084 I first went to Hillier, to make some inquiries respecting a person who was a member of that society. 
SANDERSON 5086 From seeing publications of that nature, and I was informed that the person respecting whom I was directed to make the inquiry was a member of the Corresponding Society. 
SANDERSON 5088 From seeing publications in Hillier’s shop window, which appeared to me to be of a seditious nature. 
SANDERSON 5090 He sold pamphlets. 
SANDERSON 5092 Yes. 
SANDERSON 5094 I believe towards the end of March, or the beginning of April. 
SANDERSON 5096 On the 14th of April when I first became a member, I was unexpectedly proposed, on the day following T informed Mr. Wickham that I had done so. 
SANDERSON 5098 To discover whether they had any serious intentions of arming. 
SANDERSON 5100  Yes. 
SANDERSON 5102 It was. 
SANDERSON 5104 I did. 
SANDERSON 5106 I did. 
SANDERSON 5108 On the 15th of April 1794. 
SANDERSON 5110 Division No. 11. 
SANDERSON 5112 Northamptonstreet, Clerkenwell; I do not recollect the sign tightly, but the man’s name was Holt. 
SANDERSON 5114 Yes. 
SANDERSON 5116 I cannot exactly tell, there might be about thirty. 
SANDERSON 5118 There was some conversation about the proceedings at Chalk Farm. 
SANDERSON 5120 This was the day after the meeting ad been atChalk Farm. ee 
SANDERSON 5122 The conversation turned that night principally upon that, and some were talking hat it was necessary to arm to protect the convention, in the same manner as they had in France ; I heard some present talking in consequence of & convention having been talked of at Chalk Farm ihat it would be necessary to arm to defend that convention the same as they had done to protect the Convention in France ; I think it is proper to say that their minds appeared at that time to be very much heated from what had passed at Chalk Farm, and therefore from that circumstance I did not think so much of their being serious. 
SANDERSON 5124 No, not with liquor. hat was described to have passed at Chalk Farm that should so have heated their spirits ?—There were a number of resolutions passed, 
SANDERSON 5126 Yes,Iremember one resolution, I can remember some circumstances which occurred at Chalk Farm. 
SANDERSON 5128 I was at Chalk Farm. 
SANDERSON 5130 Yes. 
SANDERSON 5132 There were a number of resolutions read which I cannot repeat; but one of them cgncluded with the words, brought the head of Charles the First to the block, and sent James the Second from the throne; then a man, whose name I understood was Birks, shouted. I remember a person, whose name I was told Was Richter, mentioned that he had, received a letter from Sheffield, I think, but am not positive to the place, that a great number of persons had met there, and that they were determined to petition parliament no more for a reform; that a convention was intended to be called, and that, I think, he said it was to take place in about six weeks, or a shorter time, 1 cannot recollect the positive words. 
SANDERSON 5134 Some persons said that they thought bolding up their hands was sufficient; this man called out, that he wished to be heard at St. James's. 
SANDERSON 5136 There was a person there whose name I was told was Thelwall, whom I never saw before nor since. 
SANDERSON 5138 Yes, he spoke several times. 
SANDERSON 5141 I believe it related to same persons that were tried. 
SANDERSON 5143 That infamous and ever to be detested Court of Justiciary in Scotland. 
SANDERSON 5145 I cannot say I have a positive recollection ; I made no minutes at the time. 
SANDERSON 5148 I think the number that was ordered to be printed was two hundred thousand.—I cannot say, whether one or two hundred thousand copies of the resolutions, if they should be wanted. a 
SANDERSON 5150 On the Monday following 1 was at the meeting of another division, 
SANDERSON 5152 At the house of one Morris, a jack-maker, in Brick-lane. 
SANDERSON 5154 I believe they call it sixteen and twenty-five. 
SANDERSON 5156 I do not recollect any thing particular, any farther than doctor Hodson was recommended by the committee to be relieved. 
SANDERSON 5159 I did. 
SANDERSON 5161 To Newgate. Whom were yoy introduced to there ?—To doctor Hodson. 
SANDERSON 5163 Yes. 
SANDERSON 5165 Yes, one Lloyd, Roussel a Frenchman, and a captain Williams, an Ameican, 
SANDERSON 5167  Yes. 
SANDERSON 5169 I he principa) conversation that 1 bad was with doctor Hodson. 
SANDERSON 5171 He was there; all those persons were present; the most material conversation that passed then was from. doctot Hodson; he asked me if I 
SANDERSON 5175 I did; he informed me that those divisions were to be called tithings; and that the purpose of was likewise to keep spies from getting among them, and betraying their intention; he likewise stated, that their numbers were Increasing, and that they would soon. be too formidable to be resisted. I made an observation, that I did not think, from what I had seen in the society, that they appeared to be men of property, to have money to effect any thing, upon which a Frenchman, who was there, got up and said, when the society was ized, money should not be wanting. 
SANDERSON 5178 There were some toasts given, one of which was given by Lloyd; the toast was, he World a Republic or a Desert : doctor Hodson said, he hoped soon to see a revoluUonary tribunal established in this country, for he despised all others, 
SANDERSON 5180 Yes. 
SANDERSON 5182 Yes. 
SANDERSON 5184 Roussel said he was going from there to Thelwall’s, and he should set off the nextday. Lloyd asked him, for the continent, he answered, oui. Hillier asked to France, he answered, yes. 
SANDERSON 5186 The persecuted patriots. 
SANDERSON 5188 I do not know; Lioyd was part of the time writing; I heard he wasa prisoner, but for what I do not know. 
SANDERSON 5190 I think it was the same evening I was. at the division to which I belonged. 
SANDERSON 5192 TLhe eleventh. 
SANDERSON 5194 One Wright a delegate, and Gordon. who was secretary, and about thirty-six other persons, I believe. 
SANDERSON 5196 Yes. 
SANDERSON 5198 His natme was Wright. 
SANDERSON 5200 After the society had broke up we were coming away; Wright asked me if. I had got any arms, I told him no; he said he had got his musket, and that it was necessary that we should all have arms, as we might very soon be compelled to use them. 
SANDERSON 5202 Yes; the secretary stated, that he was very sorry to leave the society just as they were going to act as well as think, and to regenerate their country. 
SANDERSON 5204 IHis name was Gordon, he was going to America; he said he should take some copies of their spirited resolutions to the popular societics there. 
SANDERSON 5206 Hillier said, he had not got a musket, but he had got a pike. 
SANDERSON 5208 On the 25th of April I was at Hillier’s; there were present a person whose name I afterwards was told was Wicksly. 
SANDERSON 5211 Yes, that was Bennett. 
SANDERSON 5215 To be fixed against the end of poles, and to be used against the military. 
SANDERSON 5217 For cutting the reins. 
SANDERSON 5219 I do not recollect whether he particularly explained that. 
SANDERSON 5221 Yes. 
SANDERSON 5223 It was stated in terms ; it was farther said, the principal dependance of the socicty was in securing the royal family, and both Houses of parliament. 
SANDERSON 5225 On the 25th of April ; he farther said, if they could resist the first shock, there would be no danger to be apprehended afterwards. 
SANDERSON 5227 I considered it to be the members of the different societies ; if they could resist the first shock from the army, that there would be no fear afterwards. 
SANDERSON 5229  They said the royal family being secured, the army would have no head to Took up to, and would be glad to accept the additional pay that would be offered them. 
SANDERSON 5231 I understood by the societies. 
SANDERSON 5233 There was something said, I believe it was cighteen-pence ; thatthe men would not fight for sixpence a-day if they could have eighteen pence, I think it was, but I am not positive to the sum. 
SANDERSON 5235 None: but I think it is proper to state that one person was very much in liquor, and took no part in that conversation. 
SANDERSON 5237 No. 
SANDERSON 5239 Perfectly sober. Did any one make any observation that had a tendency to repress this conversation ?—One 
SANDERSON 5242 I do. 
SANDERSON 5244 I have seen him at divisions. 
SANDERSON 5247 Baxter, this Bennet, Hillier, a man whose name I was told was Hill, and some other persons, whose names I do not know, were present during a part of this conversation ; Baxter stated, that he had been with Mr. Joyce, who was secretary to earl Stanhope: Mr. Joyce told him there was no danper to be apprehended from Stone, that Stone had too much firmness to let them get any thing out of him by intimidation. 
SANDERSON 5249 A person I understood who was confined in Newgate. 
SANDERSON 5251 I understood that he was committed upon a charge of high treason; we had some conversation about Hamilton Rowan’s escape ; he said, earl Stanhope’s speech was to be printed, with an addition, which was to be very cautiously put in ; he said, the committee of correspondence and co-operation were preparing an address to the army, with some strong resolutions ; he said, that prudent and determined men were wanted to propagate the opinions contained in those resolutions. 
SANDERSON 5253 He stated, that one Moore had been particularly active and successful in getting over the army. 
SANDERSON 5255 He said, they had most to fear from theyoung recruits; they had succeeded best with the old soldiers in Westminster; he said, if one-third of the army was got over, the other two-thirds would not act with spirit against them; he then asked me if I knew any person who would buy a ike. Whom are you speaking of now?—Baxter. 
SANDERSON 5257 Baxter. 
SANDERSON 5259 Yes, he said that the officers had made use of an expression not fitto be repeated, and asked him why he did not blow them all up together; he said the officer had been lately presented to the queen upon his promotion. 
SANDERSON 5261 It is as applied to such a person as him ; he said, that the officer had asked Baxter why they did not blow up the whole family together ; he then asked me if I knew any friends who would purchase a pike; I said I should have no objection to purchase one, but that it would be of no use unless I knew how to use it; hesaid, if I went either the Thursday or the Friday inllewing and made use of his name at the sign of the Parrot, in Green-Arbour-court in the Old-Bailey; I was to ask for one Edwards, that he would be called out to me, and I was then to tell him that Baxter had sent me, and then I was to have a pike, andI should be introduced to others, who would learn the use of them with me, and that Edwards was very clever at the use of it, and would assist us in learning; he stated, that pikes were much cheaper than muskets, and that it would be impossible for the number to procure muskets on account of the expense. There is another cicumstance, he stated, that Persons with muskets might do a great deal of mischief if tNey did notknow properly the use of them : I made an observation, that I thought we might have a reform in parliament without coming to blows; he said, is there one man in the society who believes a parliamentary reform is all we want—no, not one; he said, that many menof property had hitherto kept back on account of the sanguinary conduct of the French, but that they were Now willing to come forward, as they were convinced that a revolution might be effected in a few hours ; he said, for his own part, he did not wish the king, or any of his family, to lose their lives, but ih thought they might go to Hanover ; he said, it must be expected that some blood must be shed: some particular persons had offered such insults to the people, that human nature could not overlook ; the conversation afterwards turned relative to Thelwall’s having been indicted, in which there was nothing very material. 
SANDERSON 5263 Yes. 
SANDERSON 5265 They might; but I did Not pay much attention to any thing that fell from him, from this circumstance—that Baxter was one of the committee of correspondenceand co-operation; I thought I should obtain most information from his conversation, therefore I attended more to him. 
SANDERSON 5267 Lle said, that many thousand were Mmakiu y at Sheftield, that the heads were only to come irom there, but that thcy were to be Stochud in wown, 
SANDERSON 5269 He .recommende that nothing of that should be mentioned at any of the division-meetin 3, Ull the new constitution should be adopted, 
SANDERSON 5271 Yes, of the society: 
SANDERSON 5273 Yes, he said, because there were spies in the society. 
SANDERSON 5275 It was stated by Baxter, that it would be adviseable to let those who were prisoners out, and, if the French emigrants attempted to resist, they should share the fate of spies at Paris. 
SANDERSON 5277 The French prisoners of war. 
SANDERSON 5279  He named several, I cannot recollect all; Mr. Pitt was one, Mr. Dundas another, and Mr. Reeves, 
SANDERSON 5281 Yes. 
SANDERSON 5283 I went part of the way home with Baxter. Did he, in the course of your going home, enlarge upon any of the subjects you had been conversing about ?—I understood that the purpose of their address to the army was, to excite a jealousy between our troops and the French emigrants, which were fearon into regiments ; he stated the means that Moore had used to get over some of the army ; that he had told them that by their oath they were to fight for their king and country, but when the king and country were at variance, they had a right to fight on which side they pleased. — 
SANDERSON 5286 I do not recollect that it was, 
SANDERSON 5288 It was produced after that, at another meeting, on the 16th of May. 
SANDERSON 5290 At Hillier’s. 
SANDERSON 5292 Yes. 
SANDERSON 5294 I believe Iam wrong in point of date; it was on the 17th of May. 
SANDERSON 5300 Ido. 
SANDERSON 5302 It was after. 
SANDERSON 5304 I do. 
SANDERSON 5307 It was after the apprehension of Mr. Hardy. 
SANDERSON 5309 I did. 
SANDERSON 5311 I did.
