ROSS 7754 In Edimgh. Were you a member of any society im Edinburgh at any time ?—I suppose you mean the Friends of the People. 
ROSS 7756 Yes. 
ROSS 7758 I believe it was some time about the end of the year 1793. 
ROSS 7760 Yes, I was. 
ROSS 7762 I do not recollect at what time the convention was held. 
ROSS 7764 Yes, I was. 
ROSS 7766 I made a mistake at first; it was at the end of the year 1792 that I was made a member, and at the end of 1793 the British Convention was held. 
ROSS 7768 Yes. 
ROSS 7770 I think it was at the end of November, or the beginning of December 1793. 
ROSS 7772 Several of them. 
ROSS 7774 There were. 
ROSS 7776 Yes, there were some from England. 
ROSS 7778 No. 
ROSS 7781 Yes, I think this is the letter that I sent into the country. 
ROSS 7783 I think about halfa dozen. 
ROSS 7785 From one Mr. Stock, in Edinburgh. 
ROSS 7787 Yes. 
ROSS 7789 One that met in Simmond'ssquare, Nicholson street, on the south-side of Edinburgh. 
ROSS 7791 I do not know what it was called; it was a sociel exactly of the same nature with that of w: 
ROSS 7794 There was no committee belo to that individual society that I particularly belonged to. 
ROSS 7796 I sent several of them into the country. — 
ROSS 7798 It was sent to a person of the name of Miller, at Perth. 
ROSS 7800 I sent one to Strathaven. 
ROSS 7802 I think I sent one to Paisley, and to some other towns in the country. 
ROSS 7804 I am not certain whether I did or not. 
ROSS 7806 I took some of the minutes of the meeting of the convention. 
ROSS 7808 Now and then; sometimes I did. 
ROSS 7810 I do not recollect particularly; I would know them to be parts of the minutes of the convention that I wrote myself, if I saw them. 
ROSS 7812 I recollect something of that kind having happened, but I do not face what it was. 
ROSS 7814 I am not very certain whether I was or not, but I recollect being questioned upon that very circumstance upon the trials at Edinburgh, but I cannot be positive at present upon the circumstances what it was. 
ROSS 7816 ] do not recollect it. 
ROSS 7818 I was not present at the frst dispersion ; I was in custody then. 
ROSS 7820 Yes. 
ROSS 7822 After the dispersion of the convention, I did not act in the societies myself, but I understood
ROSS 7824  Then I do not know. 
ROSS 7826 I cannot swear positively ; it became the common talk, but Twas not present at one, and was not privy to their proceedings. 
ROSS 7828 I understood there was a committee. 
ROSS 7830 I cannot be certain to that, but I understood there was a committee. 
ROSS 7834 Never in my life. 
ROSS 7836 No. 
ROSS 7838 No ; I had not. 
ROSS 7840 I believe in the month of March or April; I am not accurate as to the time; it must be about that time, for I did not become a member of the society till the month of February, I believe. 
ROSS 7943 No ideas of that at all. 
ROSS 7945 You are very right. 
ROSS 7947 Yes. 
ROSS 7949 Yes ; very right. 
ROSS 7951 I will answer for: myself; I had not. 
ROSS 7954 I am not certain whether ever that resolution was passed in the convention. 
ROSS 7956 I do not recollect that it was proposed. 
ROSS 7958 I cannot be certain, because the convention met for several weeks, I believe; andI cannot be certain whether I was present, if that was passed at it, or no. 
ROSS 7960 I cannot answer positively to the question, on account of the convention meeting for two or three weeks, and I could not get to attend it every day for all the time that the committee met, but I commonly attended two or three hours of every day. I cannot recollect all the difterent motions that were moved and passed in the convention, whether I was present at them or not. 
ROSS 7962 I dv recollect that from your reading it. 
ROSS 7964 I hat was not my answer to the question ; he asked me if there were not reputable tradesmen belonging to that society ?—I said, yes. 
ROSS 7966 Yes. 
ROSS 7968 No. 
ROSS 7970 He was. 
ROSS 7975 I think I was present at that meeting. 
ROSS 7977 Yes. 
ROSS 7979 To petition parNiament to get those grievances redressed. 
ROSS 7982 I would never have agreed tu the motion upon any other terms. 
ROSS 7984 I ad no other idea. 
ROSS 7986 I understood it to be that some people should be authorized to call a meeting whenever any of those circumstances should take place, and the in tention of the meeting would be that of petitioning parliament. 
ROSS 7993 I understood that the delegates, whenever they got information that a convention was necessary to be held, that they should immediately repair to a place appointed. 
ROSS 7995 That is what I mean. 
ROSS 7998 I never would have agreed to the meeting of any convention, if they meant to oppose parliament; and I understood that if there was a convention called again, that they certainly would petition parliament for redressing the supposed grievances which existed. 
ROSS 8000 I understood they would petition parliament, that although their petiton was rejected, they would still continue, they would not throw aside the notion of a parlismentary reform merely from the rejection of a petition or two, 
ROSS 8003 One of the Teasons for that was, it was noticed thata petition for parliamentary reform did not specify any particular reform, and that was one of the reasons for a convention as I understood if, to specify the particular reform in their petitions that they wanted, and likewise. 
ROSS 8005 I do not recollect what I was going to say. 
ROSS 8007 At the Water of Leith. Were you a delegate at the British Convention, which assembled at Edinburgh ?—Yes. 
ROSS 8009 Sometimes. 
ROSS 8011 I believe there were. 
ROSS 8013 No. 
ROSS 8015 Yes. 
ROSS 8017 I believe there were. 
ROSS 8019  As to that Ido not remember. 
ROSS 8021 Yes. 
ROSS 8023 Yes. 
ROSS 8025 There was a large coramittee assembled, as I saw by handbills, that went under the name of the Comsnittee of Union. 
ROSS 8027 I cannot mform you as to the names. 
ROSS 8029 Some of them were, I believe some were not, at least for aught I know. 
ROSS 8031 I cannot say that, becquse I was not formerly acquainted with them. 
ROSS 8033 There was another committce chosen out of the large one, which went under the name of a Subcommittee, and after that it was styled in a inted paper a Committee of Ways and 
ROSS 8036 Mr. Stock, Mr. Bourke, Mr. Aitcheson, Mr. Bonthron, Mr. Downie, Mr. Watt, and myselfi 
ROSS 8038 Yes, I do. 
ROSS 8040 Yes. 
ROSS 8042 The purport of what he read from the paper, as I think, can thus, that it was. 
ROSS 8045 Da you know for what purpose this sub-committee was chosen ?—The reason of choosing this sub-committee, as far as I cam understand it, was, to look into the circumstances of Mr. Skirving; for this reason, that a fortnight before there was a letter read that came from him by a man on that large committee, intimatiag that there was due to him, from the Friends of the People, twenty pounds, atid he wished they would make good that payment to support his wife and family when he had left the land; that was what I conceived the committee was appuinted for. 
ROSS 8047 If it was, it was not in my presence, I never saw it. 
ROSS 8049 Yes. 
ROSS 8052  If we sought only the extirpation of one set of nieces teil men frony the management of national affairs, that place might be given to another set, without affecting the vitals adverse to the system of reform.—It then states in general, that they must have the whole, and not a part—and then he desires that there might be a general union of the people themselves; he says—“ haste therefore, (addressing himself to the prisoner) “ to associate, at 
ROSS 8055 If then such a j broken state of things should take place, the civil broils that would necessarily ensue, would soon subside: before the united, irresistible voice of the whole.—Do not, I entreat you, hesistate, thinking such a work premature as yet, but a month, and then it may be -too late—A malignant party may be already formed, and only waiting for the halting of the present managers ; it will then be too late to seck to subject to deliberation, after a party has dared the act of rebellion. ‘If you go no farther than separate Meetings in different towns, we will not be able to confide in your confraternity, because, while in such a state, you. may be but the tools of a faction—We could have all confidence, and unite with all affection in one assembly of commissfencrs from all countries of the world, if we knew they were chosen by the unbiassed voice of the people, because they would come up with the same disinterested views and desires as ourselves, having all agreed to a common centre of union and interest ; but we could not confide in fellow-citizens who kept aloof from -such union, and would not previously affiliate an one great and indivisible family. Upon the 23d of November, 1793, a letter was written to Norwich, by the prisoner, in which he informs the society at Norwich, “ of the convention'called and now sitting in Edinburgh, for the purpose of obtaining a speedy and radical reform in the system of parliamentary representation, and you are also in possession of the circumstances of our having sent two delegates, Margarot and Gerrald, to represent our increasing society in that respectable assembly. The Society for Constitutional Information has also elected twu representatives, Yorke and Sinclair, the datter only of whom has gone to Scotland for the discharge of his important mission. Then he states to the Norwich Society, that the object of the present letter was to inform them of the important communications which their mission had produced; that it had diffused spirit and resolution through the different societies in Scotland; that there must be a complete union for the recovery of their rights, and the complete renovation of the liberties and happiness which they are entitled to as men, and expect as Britons; that an increase of affection, zeal, and confidence—a concert of peemanent union—a free communication and comparison of sentiments and intentions, mature deliberation and mutual reliance, arethe fruits of the measures adopted by the friends of liberty in Scotland, and seconded by those in Lendon and Ireland. Then he presses the Society at Norwich to rouse to immediate co-operation with those efforts in Scotland, for the general good—he is desirous to awaken them toa sense of the importance of the object they were to pursue, nn to persuade all the societies in England to have an immediate junction with this federation.—And then he desires them to send a delegate of their own, in ordef that they may, by a general union, so step forward an avow their sentiments, as to ensure a speedy termis nation of the war, and a: restoration of every right'to which Britons and freemen are entitled. 
ROSS 8059 Your lordshi will also find that there was that solemn resolution made, which has before been men tioned; and from the proceedings of the s0ciety, it is clear. that they had even laid the plans of future conventions, 
ROSS 8061 There is another letter of the 24th of December, 1793, of Skirving to Hardy, p which he says—“ The time is now arriv that we must show ourselves worthy of liberty, or deservedly lose it; the opposition of our adversaries, is demonstration of the propriety and efficacy of the means which we have employed to obtain it. 
ROSS 8063 That upon any motion in the House of Commons, to prevent the eople meeting in societies for Constitutional Faeiaetion, 1 e convention should be called immediately; andyour lordships will also recollect, that that motien was communicated from Scotland (after the magistrates had ins terfered) by a letter which has been read— written, I think, by Margarot or Skirving,— in which they state that that resolution was come to, leaving out, “ in case of invasion."— And they state that letters will not safely communicate all they have to say upon the subject. 
ROSS 8068 In the first place, the letter which the altorney general has sead from Skirving. 
ROSS 8074 I believe we left off at that part of Watt's plan, that had stated a design of kindling a fire at the Ex-. cise- office in the new town’—Yes; that a fire was-to be kindled at the Excise-office, and a arty of men to be stationed at the Luckenths, a party at the head of the Westbooth, and the fire was to draw the military from the rrison. 
ROSS 8076 Yes. When they came down past the booth, the men that were stationed upon the head of the booth, according as his plan ran, they were to come in behind them, and the men, stationed at the Luckenbooths, were to take them in the front, and so inclose them between two parties; as far as I could understand the paper read to us, there were different partics, as was mentioned, who were to seize the different banking-houses in Edinburgh, and commissioners were to be appointed for to go and demand the cash from the banks: that is, as far as I recollect, the purport of that paper, which he read at that time. 
ROSS 8078 I do not know; I know not a single individual. 
ROSS 8080 What I thought upon by his plan wag that he meant it to be done by the Friends of the People ; but at the same time I did not know a single individual that was to engage in such an affair. 
ROSS 8082 He did not. 
ROSS 8084 Yes; but I look upon it to be totally drawn up by himself; I never saw it till that night when he produced it. 
ROSS 8086 There were five, J think; a Mr. Stock, myself, Watt, Downie, and Bonthron. Of how many was the committee of Ways and Means composed ?—Of seven altogether. 
ROSS 8088 Yes. 
ROSS 8090 No farther passed upon it than that I objected to it, as soon as I understood he had done reading; I said I would by no means agree to any thing that was to disturb the peace, or that tended to shed the blood of my countrymen; Mr. Bonthron agreed along with me; he said, by no means; and, finding we made opposition to 
ROSS 8092 There was nothing passed made upon it Do you remember, at any other time, Mr. Watt producing either the same plan with any enlargement, or any new plan or scheme, for any thing to be put in execution at Edinburgh?—I remember his reading a aper: 
ROSS 8094 One of the last times that I was at that committee; the last, or last but one; I ami not positive which. 
ROSS 8096 I cannot recollect ; but it was on a night when the committee used to meet. 
ROSS 8098 The subcommittee. 
ROSS 8100 It was rather a copy of a proclamation, as I collected it, prohibiting all farmers, dealers in corn, meal,) 
ROSS 8103 Yes. 
ROSS 8105 I could not recollect; I 
ROSS 8108 I rather think it might he two weeks after that. ‘ Mr. Garrow.—This proclamation forbids all farmers, dealers in cern, meal, or hay, to Femove the same under pain of death? Yes; and also to all gentlemen residing in the eountry, not to leave their respective habitations for a greater distance than three miles, under the same penalty ; these, as far as I can recollect, were the contents of that Vs bag 
ROSS 8110 On the other side of the paper there was a copy of an address to his majesty. 
ROSS 8112 Ordering him to dismiss his present ministers, and to put an end 40 this bloody war, or he might expect bad consequences ; it either ran this way—that be might expect bad consequences, or he might abide by the consequences; I could not understand which. 
ROSS 8114 The paper mentioned, I think, that this copy of an address was to be sent to his majesty the morning after the attack. 
ROSS 8116 I could look upon it in no other light than that this was to strengthen that plan which he had read in the former committee. 
ROSS 8118  Nor with the magistrates?—He did‘ not enter into particulars, upon it, for when he had read. that paper, I said, Mp. Watt, these things do pag ad to the cause of reform, and. I would by no means agree to any such things. 
ROSS 8120 Yes. 
ROSS 8122 No; I was not. 
ROSS 8124 Yes. 
ROSS 8126 Yes; Mr. Watt called upon me one day, and wished me to take a walk to Robert Orrock’s ; when I went there, he told him that he wished him to make some pikes, and, as far as I can recollect, Orrock drew a 
ROSS 8129 A smith. 
ROSS 8131 Yes, within a mile. He sketched it out upona slate, or upon a board ; hesad he had four thousand to send-to Perth, besides what he had to distribute about Edinburg); ‘that was all that I remember. 
ROSS 8133 I only knew it since was in confinement. 
ROSS 8135 I never saw one of them. 
ROSS 8137 Yes. 
ROSS 8139 I remember fe did; he said, as far as I can recollect, that he was either going to London, or to Bristol. 
ROSS 8141 He said by desire of Mr. Watt that he would wait upon Mr. Hardy, Mr. Watt sending. a letter along with him t Mr. Hardy. 
ROSS 8143 As far as I could understand it, Mr. Stock said he would take a letter to Mr. Hardy, and that he would do every thing his power to-establish a correspondence between the two. What two-do you mean, Hardy and Watt?—Yes, as far as I' understood him. 
ROSS 8145 I : he took a sheet of paper, and divided rt; he marked upon one side, the aristocrats sre doing so and so, om the other; the democrats 90 and so; —. all I can recollect a act 
ROSS 8148 Watt said if he would call upon him next day, he should have the letter. 
ROSS 8150 I never say any thing more of him after that.
