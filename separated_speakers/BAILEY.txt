BAILEY 5681  John Coomber, an officer. 
BAILEY 5683 Mr. Wickham, a magistrate. 
BAILEY 5685 On the 19th of May. 
BAILEY 5699 I was. 
BAILEY 5701 It was. 
BAILEY 5703 No, not at that time. 
BAILEY 5705 Very early in the month of Fehaere. Did you make any observations of the proceedings which took place on the 30th of January, 1794?—Yes. 
BAILEY 5707 I was desired 9 to do. 
BAILEY 5709 I was d by a particular gentleman to go there for that purpose, whose name I will mention, if you choose it. i. 
BAILEY 5711 There was a very great assembly of people there, and I believe Mr. Martin wss called to the chair, who read ‘an’ address, and I believe a Mr. Richter afterwards readaover again. 
BAILEY 5713 I do not recollect any particular toast now, but a great number were read, and by the paper that was printed I should be able to refresh my memory. 
BAILEY 5715 I have none. 
BAILEY 5717 In general the language was universal suffrage and. annual parliaments; they were met for that purpose. 
BAILEY 5719 Not that day; I heard nothing that day about the means. 
BAILEY 5721 I always understood that they were to be obtained 
BAILEY 5724 By enlightening the minds of the lower orders of the people, to give them opportunities of instruction, that they might know what the natural freedom of all mankind was. 
BAILEY 5726 By the distribution of certain papers calculated for their understandings. 
BAILEY 5730 I cannot recollect any particular person; but I may venture to say It was the general voice of the society. Did you hear any thing publicly expressed iu the society about arms ‘—No, never. 
BAILEY 5732 I have two or three times been there, 
BAILEY 5734 That is a matter of opinion 1 believe, if I am allowed to give my opinion upon those lectures I will. 
BAILEY 5736 I was'a general abuse of administation altogether. 
BAILEY 5738 Certainly, in their respective capacities. 
BAILEY 5742 In terms of contempt. 
BAILEY 5744 I have heard him make use of the word Solomon. 
BAILEY 5746 I have. 
BAILEY 5748 He said that it was an aristocratic branch that swallowed up almost every other funce tion of the government. 
BAILEY 5750 A new modellation he recommended. 
BAILEY 5752 By the general sense of the country. ‘ 
BAILEY 5754 By annual parliaments and universal suffrage. 
BAILEY 5756 If I understood him right, his meaning was. 
BAILEY 5758 Yes, by calling together the whole body of the people. 
BAILEY 5760 He certainly did. 
BAILEY 5762 Yes. 
BAILEY 5764 I was, 
BAILEY 5766 If I recol lect right, the 14th of April. 
BAILEY 5768 There was a very large assembly of persons there. 
BAILEY 5770 I do now know, I was not ‘then sufficiently acquainted to describe them, but since I have 4 means of knowledge. 
BAILEY 5772 Yes. 
BAILEY 5774 He was. 
BAILEY 5776 I believe a man of the name of Lovett. 
BAILEY 5778 There was a letter read from a society called the Frieads of the People, which letter contained — 
BAILEY 5781 The proposal was, that there should be an address. 
BAILEY 5783 If I may be allowed to look at a paper J have in my pocket. 
BAILEY 5787 There were. 
BAILEY 5789 I have. 
BAILEY 5810 In the name, and by order, of the committee, (Signed) “ W. BRETTON, chairman. «To Mr. T. Hardy, Secretary to the London Corresponding Seciety. 
BAILEY 5812 It was. 
BAILEY 5814  Yes, there was some few fell a hissing. a 
BAILEY 5850 I went from a place in Store-street, Tottenham-court-road, a good part of the way with Mr. Thelwall. 
BAILEY 5852 I had reason at first to believe it would be held in Store-street. 
BAILEY 5854 Not till after I gotto Store-street. 
BAILEY 5857 If I recollect right, he told me the reason given out of its being to be held in Store-strect was, an imagination of the magistracy interfering to prevent the Meeting. 
BAILEY 5859 Yes, 8 written notice of it put upon the door, ; 
BAILEY 5861 I cannot say. 
BAILEY 5863 Mr. Lovett, Mr. Richter, Mr. Thelwall, Mr. Hodson. 
BAILEY 5865 Two or three. 
BAILEY 5867 There was a clamour went round that there were spies and informers there; Mr. Thelwall was for admitting all spies and informers there, because the number of the members of the London Corresponding Society, could be no agreeable news to the minister. 
BAILEY 5869 I think Mr. Richter. 
BAILEY 5871 I think there was. 
BAILEY 5873 I cannot tell. 
BAILEY 5875 As far as my belief goes, I can say, but no farther. 
BAILEY 5877 I only recollect Mr. Hardy speaking three words: Mr. Richter was sg ond in the midst of his reading he stopt shart to make some observations of his own; Mr. Hardy, who stood below, said, looking up to him, ‘ read, Sir, without comment’; Lhat was all he said, and that is the whole I recollect of Mr. Hardy's saying afy thing at all. 
BAILEY 5879 The paper that has been just read. ‘ 
BAILEY 5881 The address of the London Corresponding Society. 
BAILEY 5883 I mean the general address. 
BAILEY 5885 There was a talk of a meeting to be called again soon. 
BAILEY 5887 No. 
BAILEY 5889 I went to the division room in Compton-street. 
BAILEY 5891 I do not know, I never went to any but my own division. 
BAILEY 5893 Mr. Thelwall. 
BAILEY 5895 I heard something which very much astonished me. What was it?—Thelwall said, taking up 2 pot of porter in bis hand, which had been delivered him by some waiter or somebody, he blew off the head of the porter, and said this is the way I would have all kings served, or this is the way I would serve all kings, I know not which. 
BAILEY 5897 One or other 1 am certain of. von there any particular toast given ?—Yes. 
BAILEY 5899 The lantern, at the end of Parliament-street. 
BAILEY 5901 Yes, I beg pardon, the Jamp-iron, a! the end of Parliament-street. 
BAILEY 5903 He called upon somebody to cover it. 
BAILEY 5905 Somebody, whom I know not, in the further end of the room, cried out, the ‘Treasury-bench. 
BAILEY 5907 They were. 
BAILEY 5909 Yes, I should believe that no visitor was there that night. 
BAILEY 5911 Yes. 
BAILEY 5913 Yes, he was at that time. 
BAILEY 5915 That was not in the division ruom. 
BAILEY 5917 He once said to me that annual parliaments and universal suffrage were only ladders to obtain their ends, or words to that effect. 
BAILEY 5919 He was. 
BAILEY 5921 In a place called the coffee-room, before you go into the division room. 
BAILEY 5924 No. 3, in Compton-street, Soho. 
BAILEY 5927 Between us two, there were several other people in the place called the cofice-room. 
BAILEY 5929 I do not think any one was. 
BAILEY 5931 I must explain that by something which happened previous toit. Atthe meeting at Chalk Farr, there was a kind af shed in which we were all sitting previous to the commencement of the business, and there was a bit of bread and cheese and some porter brought: . J. waa. sitting with halfa dozen or ten in the same box, and I was surprised by five or six of them pulling out little instruments exactly corresponding with each other. 
BAILEY 5933 I mean a sort of thing called a couteau secret, a French knife. 
BAILEY 5935 I have nat. 
BAILEY 5937 Yes, there is a spring, so that when the blade is put out, unless you undo that spring it cannot close. 
BAILEY 5939 Exactly ; and unless the spring fails, the person cannot cut himself by its flying back. 
BAILEY 5941 I think five or six. 
BAILEY 5944 His name was Pearce. 
BAILEY 5946 It was in consequence of the conversalion I learned; when I saw five or six of them with knives of the same description, an observation was made by one of the company that they were bread and cheese Fates, and upon that observation there was a smile; I looked upon them as harmless instruments certainly. 
BAILEY 5948 I asked where they were to be bought, and I was told I might get them of Mr. Green ; I asked where Mr. Green lived, they told me in Orangestreet; there was a man from Sheffeld in the box whose name I do not recollect, his person I well know. 
BAILEY 5950 I did not, I asked where they were to be bought; one of the company said at Mr. Green’s ; I asked where be lived; they said he was a perfumer andhair-dresser in Orange-street, Leicestetfields. 
BAILEY 5952 In about a week after I did. 
BAILEY 5954 I think he said two or three hundred; Mr. Green told me to speak very low, for the parlour-door was open which was adjoining the shop, and he and said, for my wife is a damned aristocrat. 
BAILEY 5956 I cannot recallect exactly the day, but I believe I attended regularly. 
BAILEY 5959 At the meeting at Chalk-farm he did. What did he say about the convenience of these knives?—He said, if you strike with them they will not fly back, or words to that purpose. 
BAILEY 5961 Iam very sure of that; there was a man from Shefheld, who found fault very much with the construction of these knives. 
BAILEY 5963 That they were made in a bungling manner, that they were not equal to those made at Sheffield. 
BAILEY 5965 He did. 
BAILEY 5967 No. 
BAILEY 5969 Yes. 
BAILEY 5971 In the division. 
BAILEY 5973 I do not recollect the date of that. 
BAILEY 5975 There was. 
BAILEY 5977 That I cannot say, I think to the contrary ; I think they said he had been relieved : I am bound to speak the truth, and therefore must certainly add this to it, that the application for relief was rejected on the und of the violence of that person's conduct, and I think there was another reason if my memory is right; he was not considered asa member of the London Corresponding Society. 
BAILEY 5979 I was. 
BAILEY 5981 Yes. 
BAILEY 5983 I do not think I have. 
BAILEY 5985 In. the month of February. 
BAILEY 5987 No. 
BAILEY 5989  Number 2. 
BAILEY 5991 Number three was the number of the house, No. 2, the number of the division. 
BAILEY 6001 I mean on the lowering, as well as the rising side of the medium. But, with regard to lund-rent, its variations have always heen progressive ; and to find a single instance to the contrary, would be almost, if not altogether, impossible ! t requires but little sagacity to see, that the Game Laws, Riot-act, Laws against Vagrants and Felons, &c. &c. are made chiefly for the sccurity of the rich against the depredations of the poor. But what security have the poor against the oppression and extortion of the rich? Certainly none at all. As every comfort of life is derived from land, and as the rich are the proprietors thereof, it may in some sense be said, that they hold the issues of life and death; and, whilst they can, uninterruptedly, raise their rents without Fimitation or restraint, they have an alarming and unbounded power over, not only the happiness, but even the lives of the great mass of the people—the poor “If, then, statesmen have a right to advance their lands in times of prosperity, the poor ought to have a parliament of their own choosing, invested with power to reduce them in days of adversity. pers between the rick and the poor, would productive of a thousand times more consolation to this nation, than the chimerical ftionsense of court jugglers, ‘the balance of power in Europe. Nor can I imagine that any judicious person would call such a power in parliament unjust or irrational, which, when exercised, could ruin none, but bless tnillions! If it would be cruel to make a statesman of twenty thousand pounds per annum, live a year or two upon ten thousand; how much more remorseless is it, to make the Spitalfield and Norwich weavers, as well as some hundred thousands more, live upon nothing—or, what is little better, upon charity!!! Besides, it is a curious truth, that the very article which ruins hundreds of the voluptuous great, would render happy the innumerable unhappy part of mankind ! Great Gop! What spectacle so affecting to a reflecting mind as Great Britain in her present state! On the one hand, we see the impudent nobles advertising their “ Grand Dinners, in the very face of the hun; poor, whom they have ruined!! On the other hand, widows, orphans, and others are weeping, and often dying for want of bread ! 
BAILEY 6013 I was, if that was the day the dinner was had. 
BAILEY 6015 I was. 
BAILEY 6017 The preceding evening, between the hours of nine and ten, Mr. Hardy came to my house, and brought me a ticket; I think 7s. 6d. marked enit. I put my hand in my pocket thinking I was to pay, he said no, there is nothing to pay for this ticket. 
BAILEY 6019 I had no conversation with him upon that subject at all. 
BAILEY 6021 Between the hours of nine and ten o'clock. 
BAILEY 6023 In Crown-court, Covent-garden. 
BAILEY 6025 I understood it to be a meeting of the Constitutional Society with a certain number of the London Corresponding Society, who were invited to that dinner, and Mr. Hardy brought me a ticket unknown and unexpected. 
BAILEY 6027 I did. 
BAILEY 6029 I think, if. I may presume to 
BAILEY 6031 I think I may say twenty. 
BAILEY 6033 There was some news of some public event. 
BAILEY 6035 I understood it to be very bad news. 
BAILEY 6037 There seemed universal satisfaction, and it was carried about the room seemingly with great eagerness. 
BAILEY 6039 It was delivered to me before dinner in a room adjoining the dinner-room, by a person who deliv them round to all the people there, as far as they could go, I believe. 
BAILEY 6041 I recollect now there was a paper on the plates. 
BAILEY 6043 I cannot say. 
BAILEY 6045 I have not. 
BAILEY 6047 I cannot. 
BAILEY 6049 I anderstood Mr. Horne‘ Tooke, No, I believe a Mr. Wharton, and even in that I do not know that I am correct, but I think so, Mr. Wharton. 
BAILEY 6051 He was. 
BAILEY 6053 I do. 
BAILEY 6055 Mr. Horne Tooke, Mr. Wharton, a gentleman whom [I saw in court just now, of the name of ‘Birchall, Mr. Sharp, whom I have known many years, an engraver; there were several members of the London Corresponding Society. f 
BAILEY 6057 Yes; he was: 
BAILEY 6059 I cannot undertake to say, I did not belong to the Constitutional Society. 
BAILEY 6061 Mr.. Hardy was there. 
BAILEY 6063 He was there. 
BAILEY 6065 Yes. 
BAILEY 6067 He was there. 
BAILEY 6069 Yes. 
BAILEY 6071 Yes. 
BAILEY 6073 Yes. 
BAILEY 6075 There are several Jones’s. 
BAILEY 6078 That was not sung as I recolleet, but the moment the company got into the room, the music struck up Ca ira. 
BAILEY 6080 Yes, the Marsellois march—the Carmagnol. 
BAILEY 6082 I never heard such an universal din of approbation in the course of my life; it was nothing but a scene of clamour, for I do believe most people’s hands smarted, and their ears ached, 
BAILEY 6084 I do not. 
BAILEY 6086 I cannot charge my memory. , 
BAILEY 6088 That I do. 
BAILEY 6090 I will; some time after dinner Mr. Horne Tooke got up, and silence was called, and he refaced his address by an observation that, f believe, one out of fifty in that room might be considered as a government spy, and to them he wished particularly to address himself; and, in consequence of that address, I must confess I did attend; in consequence of his addressing himself to goyernment spies, I certainly did attend to what he said; for my idea of a spy and informer may differ particularly in a business of this nature. 
BAILEY 6092 He begged the company to take notice, that fhe was not in a state of inebriation; for having something to say to the company, he had taken care to refrain from his glass; and for fear of being mistaken, and being taken tp be in a state of intoxication, he begged every body present to take particular notice of what he said; he called the parliament a scoundrel sink of corruption; he called the opposition in parliament a scoundrel sink of opposition ; he said, that there was a junction between those two scoundrel ies, formed for the purpose of destroying the rights and Liberties of the country; he began to speak about the hereditary nobility; he asked, if that skip-jack, Jenkinson, could be considered as one of the hereditary nobility of the country; and I think, if my memory is right, that he paid the same compliment to the House of Lords that he did to the House of Commons. 
BAILEY 6094 That there was a junction between the ministerial and the opposition in the House of 
BAILEY 6096 Yes; he said it was in order to amuse, or abuse, (he used one of these words, I am not sure which word) that poor man, the king. 
BAILEY 6098 The junction between the two parties. 
BAILEY 6100 I do not recol: likewise, that the junction of the opposition in parliament with the aristocratic party in the House of Commens, was likewise meant to abuse and deceive the people of this country. The junction of parties in the House of Gommons, to abuse the people of this country. wy 
BAILEY 6102 I cannot say. 
BAILEY 6104 I do not recollect. wae, fers this agarets of bis i recent ith applause, wi t applause. 
BAILEY 6106 There was. 
BAILEY 6108 I cannot recollect. 
BAILEY 6110 No; a song to the tune of God save the King. 
BAILEY 6112 You have recalled something to tuy memory that I had forgot—if I am right, ‘ 
BAILEY 6117 I do not recollect the words. 
BAILEY 6119 Yes, and I do not know whether there was Not one put upon each plate; if it was not that, it was something else; Mr. Horne Tooke sung that song. 
BAILEY 6121 I do not.
