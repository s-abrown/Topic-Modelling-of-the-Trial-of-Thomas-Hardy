SMITH 10940 Ye 
SMITH 10942 Yes. ala, 
SMITH 10945 That I cannot tell; it "2 never a med of the society, and t is innpossible to say that. 
SMITH 10947 No, I never of te in my life, nor dagger, nor any thing Sort. 
SMITH 10949 No. 
SMITH 10951 No. 
SMITH 10953 I kept myself as muci as possible in my own house. 
SMITH 10955 We applicd to po magiswate 
SMITH 10958 None. 
SMITH 10960 No. 
SMITH 10962 No. 
SMITH 10964 They were daily in the rs. 
SMITH 10966 In the paper—in the register it was put, that we advised people to arm to assist the magistrates. 
SMITH 10968 Yes, it was in the Courant. 
SMITH 10970 I do not know what that was. 
SMITH 10972 It was that I named in the Courant. 
SMITH 10977 As far as they advised people to arm, it was according to the rules of the constitution. 
SMITH 10979 Words similar to it; we had some apprehensions from it. 
SMITH 10981 Similar ones to it. 
SMITH 10983 Yes. 
SMITH 10985 I understood equal representation in parliament, and that without it the people would not, asI understood the matter, have their rights. 
SMITH 10987 For every man to have his voice. 
SMITH 10989  Yes. 
SMITH 10992 Sometimes. 
SMITH 10994 Yes. Then of course, you had a cheap copy of 
SMITH 10996 I have read Paine. 
SMITH 10998 I have seen one of the others, 
SMITH 11001 I have seen both. 
SMITH 11004 I appeal to the Court, whether I am to answer that. 
SMITH 11006 Yes; I have read one. 
SMITH 11008 I obtained it by a subscription. 
SMITH 11010 No; my own, and a few friends. 
SMITH 11012 I cannot tell that. 
SMITH 11014 There were many. 
SMITH 11016 Yes; I thought well of it. 
SMITH 11018 Sometimes I was there, sometimes not. 
SMITH 11020 It seldom, or never, was read publicly at the society ; Ido not know that ever it was read in the society. 
SMITH 11022 It was, when we met privately at our own houses; a few friends. 
SMITH 11024 Any thing. 
SMITH 11026 Not many; there were a few. 
SMITH 11028 No. 
SMITH 11030 No. 
SMITH 11032 No. 
SMITH 11034 I recollect seeing their names, never more than what was published in the public papers. 
SMITH 11036 No. 
SMITH 11038 I do not recolfect that I was at that meeting. 
SMITH 11040 I was not, I believe. 
SMITH 11042 I cannot tell that. 
SMITH 11044 I did. 
SMITH 11046 I never took that into consideration properly. 
SMITH 11048 If he does, that is not my mind. 
SMITH 11050 I believe it did, so far as I have read; hut I never took notice of that passage ; so far as I approve of it, I agrecd ; but I did not take it that Mr. Paine meant to destroy the king of this country. 
SMITH 11052 Though it was published that we had gained some knowledge by his works, that was never the intention of the society, nor did they take that part of his works, 
SMITH 11054 Only so far as concerned the House of Commons. 
SMITH 11056 No. 
SMITH 11058 Yes, I understand it oes. 
SMITH 11060 Yes, I suppose he does. 
SMITH 11062 I believe it is, 
SMITH 11064 I suppose it is. 
SMITH 11066 Our society never took that into consideration, 
SMITH 11068 I cannot say. 
SMITH 11070 I cannot say. 
SMITH 11072 Not of that passage; we never took that into consideration. 
SMITH 11074 I cannot say whether it was or was not; it might be. 
SMITH 11076 It was always advised for people to submit. 
SMITH 11078 I do not know that there were. 
SMITH 11081 I believe I do. “ Monarchy would not have continued so many ages in the world, had it not been for the abuses it protects. It is the master fraud which shelters all others. Do you recollect this ?—Yes. 
SMITH 11083 That was never agitated. 
SMITH 11085 Yes. 
SMITH 11087 We understood that we might obtain some redress; we did notwish, In any way, to touch upon the laws ofthis country, by any means. 
SMITH 11089 I can only answer for myself. 
SMITH 11091 I understood him to be expressing disattection to the king ; but then they were always put away, those things, and never adhered to, upon no consi-deration whatever, by any of us. 
SMITH 11093 We never intended to do so. 
SMITH 11095 Certainly ; the words are so. 
SMITH 11097 Yes. 
SMITH 11099 Yes, and we thought that the proper place to petition. 
SMITH 11101 I have scen them, but I have not read them all. 
SMITH 11103 Yes. 
SMITH 11106 I never heard any body call it so. 
SMITH 11108 Yes. 
SMITH 11110 No. 
SMITH 11112 Yes, I know him; I have seen him. 
SMITH 11114 Yes. ry private, and in public?—I have heard im. 
SMITH 11116 Sometimes. 
SMITH 11118 No. 
SMITH 11120 I was there some of the times. 
SMITH 11122 I here was. 
SMITH 11124 It was altered to petitioning the king. 
SMITH 11126 Yes, it was. 
SMITH 11128 I do not know. 
SMITH 11131 I cannot answer, there was such a concourse of people. 
SMITH 11133 By holding up of hands. 
SMITH 11135 Y es. 
SMITH 11137 Yes, I was there. 
SMITH 11139 I cannot tell ; may be two thousand. 
SMITH 11141 I was there as a lookeron; that was all. 
SMITH 11143 Never, to my knowledge. 
SMITH 11145 I never did, 
SMITH 11147 No; I did not. 
SMITH 11149 I did; but never read them. 
SMITH 11151 They were to be bought at the shops. 
SMITH 11153 No ; I was not concerned in it at all. 
SMITH 11155 Yes, accompanied with the other. 
SMITH 11157  Yes. 
SMITH 11159 No. 
SMITH 11162 We have troubled your grace to attend, in order to inform the Court whether this letter, which it has been proved in the course of the evidence, the people of Bhesiield all looked up to, as containing a . 
SMITH 11166 It is extremely difficult for me to say, whether the printed paper, that is this moment given to me, is precisely the letter I did write tu colonel Sharman, or not, because I know that there was a printed edition of that letter which was mutilated ; therefore, whether this is an exact copy, or not, I cannot pretend to say. 
SMITH 11168 I could. 
SMITH 11171 I think I can make the matter shorter, by putting into Mr. Erskine’s hand a copy of the original edition. 
SMITH 11177  Will your grace have the goodness to cast pour eye upon this Journal, of the 8th of Feruary, 1780? There is an entry that the Lords should be summoned to attend the 
SMITH 11179 It is. 
SMITH 11182 This was a anotion, which came on in the House of Lords, recorded in the Journals of parliament ; there were petitions from a great number of associated bodies of men in this country, which associations were callin; emphatically and loudly upon the House on Commons to attend to its trust, for the House of Commons is,. itself, a delegated body, representing the people; calling upon the House of Commons to attend to its trust in consequence of that wasteful horrible expenditure which took place in the American war.
