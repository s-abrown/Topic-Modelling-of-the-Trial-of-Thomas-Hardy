LYNAM 6954 Resolved that thanks be given to the twelve men that voted with Mr. Whatton the 6th of June—The Constitutional Society for information have published ten thousand from one of the division of a gentleman that lives at Walworth, who is going to join the Jondon Corresponding Sociely : and it is at the same time observed, that he wrote the offensive play-bill, the guillotine, his name is evening, in the information that they endeavoured to bring forward of different circumstances, it was stated in that way, and it was followed up by a remark from the same:person, that many people supposed that he was employed by the Convention in France. 
LYNAM 6955 Were any other papers brought forward 
LYNAM 6957 When you say it was treasouable, do you mean to say that that was Mr. Vaughan’s opinion 
LYNAM 6959 Was any thing done upon that 
LYNAM 6961 Did the delegate report any thing farther, after it was found that that petition was supposed to be treasonable 
LYNAM 6963 Was there any thing farther done at that meeting 
LYNAM 6965 Or have you any recollection? if not, go on to the next meeting, which was on the 7th of October
LYNAM 6967 That was at the division meeting
LYNAM 6969 Mr. Bell, who was at Brighton, was going to Ireland, and would introduce a correspondence with the societies there, from the London Corresponding Society. At the last meeting of delegates a petition was brought forward, or agitated, was brought forward, discussed, I suppose, against the war, nothing more is said of that. Hvdgson was chose president, and Hardy was continued secretary; the next is November the 5th. 
LYNAM 6970 Before you go to November the 5th, were you present at any other meeting, at Hackney, or any other place 
LYNAM 6972 At what time was that—it has indeed been proved to be the 24th of October 
LYNAM 6974 Were two delegates elected at that meceta FW ho were they 
LYNAM 6976 Who appeared as president of the society at that time
LYNAM 6978 Where was this meeting
LYNAM 6980 Was Mr. Hardy at that meeting in Ilackneyroad
LYNAM 6982 What meeting were you aton the 5th of November 
LYNAM 6984 ‘that Baxter was chosen chairman; he then reported that Margarot and Gerrald went to 
LYNAM 6985 Scotland, the 80th of October, and that the fund was very low, the subscription not equal to the expenses. 
LYNAM 6986 Where was this
LYNAM 6988 Constitutional Society; the next meeting was November the 12th. 
LYNAM 6989 Before you get to November the 12th, were there any reports made upon the 5th of November, respecting F, low 
LYNAM 6991 Do you recollect any thing stated about Franklow, upon the 5th of November 
LYNAM 6993 Recollect all the circumstances that youcan, respecting that. 
LYNAM 7193 what sort of commission line?—Both in the Birmingham and Sheffield. 
LYNAM 7195 Not now. 
LYNAM 7197 I have been in the commission line, and am in the sada line now. 
LYNAM 7200 TI have certainly leisure, and if I am to answer you how it is that I have you in a very candid manner, and tell you, that Iam making an application for a business in the East-India line ; thatis, to attend at the coffee-houses to take orders from the captains and mates, and different officers on’ board, but I dothat business on my own ac-" count. 
LYNAM 7202 In a small degree I have done it for I suppose these seven years. 
LYNAM 7204 Yes; till the last season. 
LYNAM 7206 The last season. 
LYNAM 7208 I never did so much as I did the last season. 
LYNAM 7211 I first of all had a warehouse in Wood-street ; I removed from oe house in Wood street to another, and from thence to Walbrook, where I have been ever since. 
LYNAM 7213 Yes. 
LYNAM 7215  Yes. 
LYNAM 7217 I have always kept a warehouse for wholesale business ; 1 have never been in the retail way since I left Shrimpton and company. 
LYNAM 7219 Yes. 
LYNAM 7221 Yes. 
LYNAM 7223 Yes; the resolutions and address. It is the address that was brought out after the original one I stated in the month of March 1792, that was too small; afterwards it became more voluminous, and it has been made use of from that time to the present. 
LYNAM 7225 No; it was the 24th of May, 1792. 
LYNAM 7227 Yes, it is, 
LYNAM 7229 Yes. 
LYNAM 7231 Yes. 
LYNAM 7233 Yes. 
LYNAM 7235 Yes; as near as I can give you any intelligence. 
LYNAM 7237 Yes. 
LYNAM 7239 I was tried upon evidence ; I was tried upon evidence that was brought forward at the meeting of the deleates. 8 Were you asked whether there was any foundation for that charge or no ?—There were four or five gentlemen brought forward to the committee of delegates to prove that I was nota friend to the society ; it took up a long consideration, and it was verv late before we parted, and after hearing all that they could say, and from whence arose that suspicion, I was honourably acquitted. I have got down the names of my accusers, in the course of my minutes, but I did not take any kind of notice of it, not thinking it necessary. 
LYNAM 7242 I consulted with a friend, and informed him that there were such and such societies about London. 
LYNAM 7245 Yes. 
LYNAM 7248 I do not know how far I am at liberty to answer this question; I made my reports toa person ina quarter that I was well satisfied that a proper knowledge would be had; whether it is by a magistrate, or whether by any body else, it makes no difference, I was satisfied ia my mind that these societies would be known by those reports. 
LYNAM 7250 I have nat said so. 
LYNAM 7252 I said I would answer it in the best manner I possibly could, and that is, whether it was a maistrate or any other person, I was satisfied om the quarter I gave my information to, that it was well known that there were these societies. 
LYNAM 7254 Yes. 
LYNAM 7257 tIf 1 am by your lordship’s direction to answer this question directly, I certainly will. 
LYNAM 7259 It was not to a magistrate. 
LYNAM 7268 Ask himpublic mischief should be incurred; and it af it was any servant of the public. says, that if men’s names are to be mentioned 
LYNAM 7280 I did: not. Your original question was, to know how it was that I gave a communication; there has been a misunderstanding, how it was that I did give any information; I told you I was advised by a friend to give a communication, and that from him I was recommended to give that communication, and I gave it in a quarter—I believe these were the express words—I gave it in a quarter that I was well satisfied that it would be known, that there were these sort of societies in London; the mistake that has beenmade is, that I ial rare d communicated with this gentleman that I first of all consulted: I never saw that gentleman afterwards, but the channel, the dearer that he directed me to, I pursued all the way through. 
LYNAM 7295 not, says my learned friend (and i wish your lordships to try this reasoning), not to ask what were the particulars of the communication, but to ask the fact, whether this person did or did not advise with him in the year 1792? Now what is the reason that you cannot ask the particulars of the advice? The vety same reason why you cannot ask to the fact, whether he advised with him or not, videlicet, that im the given case it supposed a principle of public justice, which overbalances the private mischief that happens in the case stated. 
LYNAM 7305 No. 
LYNAM 7307 After. 
LYNAM 7309 I communicated it in-the month of October: immediately after I knew that there were societies of this sort, I communicated it to this friend of mine; he is s gentlemen of very considerable property. 
LYNAM 7311 His advice to me was, to give information : this was after I was acquainted that there was such a society as the London Corresponding Society; in consequence of that advice I gave information immediately, which was in the samme month of October, 1792, and I continued it to the month of February. 
LYNAM 7313 In writing. 
LYNAM 7315 I gavecopies. 
LYNAM 7317 I do not immediately recollect, I believe I have some, 
LYNAM 7319 I have two of them 
LYNAM 7321 I have some private memorandums. 
LYNAM 7325 I have this reason, because I had a communication, and had in- , 
LYNAM 7328 It is impossible for me to de it in this light ; I will look the book over; I have no objection ; I will go into any room and look it over, andI shall give you ae book with the greatest pleasure imaginable. 
LYNAM 7330 I do not wish, by any means, to report eny thing but what is absolutely the fact; nor would I wish to withhold any thing that Ido not think is right to be withheld. I know there are some private memorandums, and it is impossible for me to look them through now, while 1 stand here. 
LYNAM 7332 I am very ready and willing. 
LYNAM 7334 I1 am pertectly willing. 
LYNAM 7336 Iam not sure that there are no memorandus of that kind on them. 
LYNAM 7338 That was always a regular rule. 
LYNAM 7340 Sometimes there was a communication which has been conceived by the chairman not proper to be communicated to the divisions; and Margarot has said, you must not communicate this; and as to this book that you are asking for, the delegates were allowed to take reports or information, whether from the chairman, or any of the delegates, either with regard to a letter, or any other matter. The chairman has said, though you are informed such a thing has been wrote or has happened, though you are allowed to take a minute of it, we tell you it is not fit it should be communicated to the divisions; but that notes were allowed to be taken at all times is true. 
LYNAM 7342 It was the practice every nignt. 
LYNAM 7344 It was. 
LYNAM 7346 I have heard of some reports made by other people ; this circumstance might strike me, and another circumstance might strike another, which I might not take particular notice of, or think it worth while to put down. 
LYNAM 7349 I do not know howto answer that question, as you put it, I do conceive that a delegate being sent to know what business the socicty was transacting, that he should take the best account of it that he possibly could. ‘ 
LYNAM 7351 I was elcoted a delegate, as I statcd, in the beginning of November, 1792, and continued so till the month of June, 1793. 
LYNAM 7353 I put: down every thing I possibly could; but I did not put down every thing that did pass, nor was it in the power of any of the delegates to do so; but it was the invariable practice of the delegates to-make minutes cither upon paper, or in books, for the purpose of commu. Dicating what had been transacted at the meeting of delegates at the next division, at their meetings, on different nights, from Thursday to ‘Thursday. 
LYNAM 7355 I made these notes as a real, bond fide delegate to No. 23. I made those reports at that jLvision. 
LYNAM 7358 I informed you, when you asked me that question, that the information was not given to a magistrate : I tuld you that it was by the advice ofa friend, who confirmed my own opinion, entertained at the first. When I found this society at the sign of the Mansion-house, it was absolutely necessary it should be known; he recommenced me to that quarter, which quarter I was persuaded was that of a certainty. 
LYNAM 7360 I went to no magistrate; but was advised to go to another quarter, and I went to that quarter. 
LYNAM 7362 I did not. 
LYNAM 7364 I gave that information myself, 
LYNAM 7366 I sent them to that quarter. 
LYNAM 7370 He xecommended me fo a particular quarter. 
LYNAM 7372 I hat I cannot answer. 
LYNAM 7376 The best way of explanation is to say, that the person he recommended me to, recommended me to a third erson, and to that third person I gave the information, and continued it all the way through. 
LYNAM 7379 I attended the society all the way through, though not as a delegate—I was a delegate to February, 1794. 
LYNAM 7381 In the course of the memorandums that I have made, I have got names. 
LYNAM 7383 Yes. 
LYNAM 7385 It is so; names are put toe some, and not to others. 
LYNAM 7387 I did. 
LYNAM 7389 They were taken down for the purpose of reporting as a delegate, and for the other purpose too. 
LYNAM 7391 Just so. 
LYNAM 7393 I have not; but I was going to say this, there are some private memorandums that are in this book, which do not belong to the society; those private inemorandums are wrote at the back of the society’s minutes; those are such as, I think, it would be very impropor for me to deliver up, and therefore I wish to know what I am to do in that case. 
LYNAM 7395 I could do it, if I were allowed time. 
LYNAM 7397 Could you obliterate those memorandums which concern other people, witha pen and ink
