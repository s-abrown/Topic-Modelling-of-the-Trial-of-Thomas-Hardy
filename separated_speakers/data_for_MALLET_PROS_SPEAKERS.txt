ATTORNEYGENERAL 1  May it please your Lordship and gentlemen of the Jury, In the course of stating what I have to offer to your must serious attention in this great and weighty cause, affecting, as it certainly does, the dearest interests of the community, affecting, as you will remember throughout this business, every interest which can be valuable to the prisoner at the bar, I shall have frequent occasion to call that anxious attention to the different parts of the indictment which has just been opened to you. 1 forbear to do so at this moment, because I think that attention will be more usefully, both with respect to the public, and to the prisoner, given and required in another part of what Iam to address to you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 2 Gentlemen, the prisoner, who is before you, stands charged (to state the indictment generally) with the offence of compassing his majesty’s death; he was committed upon that charge by his majesty’s privy council: I will explain to you presently why I state this and the following facts. In consequence of the apprehension of this prisoner, of several others charged by this indictment, and of others whose names do not occur in this indictment, proceedings of some notoricty were had in parliament, and an act passed, empowering his majesty to detain such persons as he suspected were conspiring against his government. That act has asserted, that a traitorous and detestable conspiracy had been formed for subverting the existing laws and government of the country, and for introducing that system of anarchy and confusion, which had so fatally prevailed in France ; the act, upon the spur oft the emergency, which it contemplated, authorized the detention without bail, mainprize, or discharge, of the persons then in prison for high treason, or treasonable practices, or who should afterwards be committed, for high treason or treasonable practices, by warrants from the privy council or secretary of state, until the first of February, 1795. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3 Gentlemen, this ‘measure, which did not suspend the operation of the Habeas Corpus act, that great palladium of English liberty, but with reference to particular persons, under particular commitments, for particular offences, is a measure never adopted in this country by parliament but in cases, in which it is understood, after giving all possible atten tion to secure the right of the subject from being broken in upon, to be of the last possible necessity, and which has been repeatedly putin foree, in the best of times, in such cases, where the wisdom of parliament apprehended that it was matter of their duty to rovide that the nation should part with its iberty for a while, that it might not lose it for eraa entlemen, appearing before you this da: in discharge of Sardi, which I have beet commanded to execute and the execution of which appears to me to be absolutely necessary, you will collect from the fact that I do appear here this day, that, accordin, to the true constitutional meaning of suc an act of parliament, it is not that the trial of such persons shall be delayed during the period of the suspension of the act, but that the act shall, with reference to the time of trial, be allowed, in the right execution of it, an operation only to that extent in which the due consideration of the public safety, tempered with a due attention to the liberty of the individual subject, may require. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4 Gentlemen, the proceedings of the legislalature having been such as T have stated to you, his majesty, constitutionally advised in the exercise of his duty, as the great conservator of the public peace, directed a commission to issue to inquire whether any such treasons, as the presumption of such a traitorous conspiracy must necessarily suppose to have existed, had been committed by any persons, and by whom. In the execution of the duties of that commission, a grand jury of this county, upon their oaths, have declared that there is ground of charge against the person at the bar, and against others, sufficient to call upon them, ina trial to be had before you, their country, to answer tov an accusation of high treason, in compassing his majesty’s death. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5 Gentlemen, I have stated these circumstances, that I may convey to you, in as strong terms as I can express it, this observation, that, as the proccedings of parliament ought to have had (and I am persuaded, from the deliberation which they gave the subject, that they had) no influence upon the judicial mind of the grand inquest, ncither ought these proceedings to affect your inquiries, or to induce you to any determination, which you are to make upon the issue, which you are now sworn to try. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6 Gentlemen, there is no one circumstance of any proceedings before parliament, with reference to which you ought to suffer yourselves to be influenced in the trial of this issue. It is obvious that such proceedings, as were had in parliament, providing for great emergencies, may be required and authorized by the genuine spirit of the constitution, even in cases in which a grand jury might not, upon any thing that could be offered to their consideration, be justified in finding a bill: it is much more obvious, that, in a proceeding before you, a consideration of the wisdom and propriety of the acts of the legislature is not called for. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7 You therefore, gentlemen of the jury, will consider the prisoner as standing before you in full possession of an absolute right to the presumption of innocence, notwithstanding e is charged with guilt by this indictment, as you will hear, except so far as that presumption is met by the single simple fact, that he has been accused by a grand jury of his country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8 Gentlemen, before I conclude these generat observations, you will permit me to say, on the other hand, that, if there has been any thing that has fallen under your observation, by act or publication—any attempt to make 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9 ‘ any impression upon the minds of those who are this day impanelied to try this great cause, to disparage that advice, which, under the most responsible sanction, may be given you in matter of law, to work in your minds any prejudice either against the prisoner, or on the prisoner’s behalf; on the one hand I am perfectly sure that your integrity will be security to the public, that you will not permit any attempt of that kind to have any operation; on the other hand, gentlemen of the jury, Tam equally sure that I necd not ask from an English jury, that ane would permit no such attempt to prejudice them against the prisoner at the bar,—no, not even an injudicious or ill executed attempt, to influence them in his favour. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10 Gentlemen, in order to understand the law of treason, and the indictment, I shall take the liberty first to state to you the character which I apprehend the king, for the protection of whose person and government the statute in question was made, has in the State and constitution of this country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11 Gentlemen, the power of the state, by which I mean the power of making laws, and enforcing the execution of them when made, is vested in the king; enacting laws, in the one case, that is, in his legislative character, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords spiritual and temporal, and of the Commons in parliament assembled, assembled according to the law and constitutional custom of England; in the other case, executing the laws, when made, in subservience to the laws so made, and with the advice, which the law and the constitution have assigned to him in almost every instance, in which they have called upon him to act for the benefit of the subject. The king’s authority, under the check of constitutional and legal provisionsand limitations, convenes and regulates the duration and existence of parliament, convening those whom, according to the law and custom of the country, he is bound to convene. The king, in his parliament, sitting in his royal political capacity, and the Lords and Commons there assembled, form the great body politic of the kingdom, by which is exercised sovereign authority in legislation. gentlemen, whilst the present law, the present constitution, and present government of Great Britain, exist, no law can be made but by that authority ; no legislative power can be created against the will, andin defiance of that authority. Whether in any, or in what circumstances, an attempt to create such a power isa treason forbiden by the statute of the 25th of Edward Srd, I propose to examine presently. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 12 Gentlemen, as in the king the power of legislation is vested, as well as the executive power of the state, to be exercised with consent and advice, to be exercised according to those laws, which are the birthright and inheritance of the subject, having upon him the care and protection of the community ; to him, in return, the allegiance of every individual is, according to the law of England, due ; that allegiance, by which the subject is bound, in the Janguage of the statutes of this country, to defend him “ against all traitorous conspiracies and attempts whatsoever, which shall be made against his person, his crown, or his dignity. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 13 Gentlemen, to ascertain to whom this care and protection is committed—to ascertain to whom this allegiance is due, the breach of which, according to the venerable lord Hale, constitutes high treason, is necessary to the peace of the community—to ascertain and to define accurately what constitutes a breach of that allegiance, is essentially and absolutely necessary to the security of all that our ancestors have claimed, demanded, and insisted upon, as the ancient, undoubted rights and liberties of our country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 14 Gentlemen, the former of these ubjects is secured by the law and constitutional custom of England; that law which alike secures to you every right, whether it be a right of person or of property. It has made the crown, which his majesty wears, hereditary (and I beg your attention to that), subject to limi tation by parliament. The latter object has been most anxiously secured by the statute referred to in the indictment, which brings forward the charge, the truth of which you are now to try. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 15 Gentlemen, the king having this hereditary crown, the law and constitution have also ascertained his dutics—those duties, which it is incumbent upon him to execute, for the benefit of the subject, in the execution of which duties they have aided him with counsel, and in consideration of which duties they have clothed him with dignity, and vested him with high prerogatives. With respect to the duties of the king, they attach upon him the instant he becomes such; from the moment that his title accrues, in the same instant the duty of allegiance (the breach of which is high treason) attaches to it; he recognizes these as his duties in that oath, to which, throughout this business, I must again call your attention, in that cath which he is bound to take upon him, at bis coronation, by which he promises and swears “ to govern the people of this country, mark the words, gentlemen, “ according to the statutes in parliament agreed upon, and the laws and customs of the sume ; that to his power he will cause law in justice and mercy to be administered; that he will maintain the laws of God and the true profession of religion established by law. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 16 Gentlemen, this oath, stated by that great and venerable constitutional judge, Mr. Justice Foster, to be a solemn and a public recognition, not only of the duties of the king, but of the fundamental rights of the people, imposeth upon him (and throughoutthis case it cannot be too strongly recollected that it imposeth upon him) the most sacred obligation to govern according to the laws and statutes in parliament agreed upon, according to the laws and customs of the same, and no other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 17 Gentlemen, addressing this Court, which is a court of law, in which you, the jury, are sworn to make a true deliverance according to the law of England, can I impress it too strongly that it cannot be supposed by possibility—not by possibility—that the king can, consistently with his oath, and with the antecedent duty recognized in the explicit engagement, the terms of which you have heard, either act, or permit himself to act, as kin, according to any rules of government, forme: by any bodies of men, assuming any character, functions, or situations, those rules of government being meant to operate as laws, the statutes agreed upon in parliament, and the duws and customs of the same, only excepted ? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 18 Gentlemen, it seems to me to follow, as a necessary conclusion from the reasoning to be addressed to a court of law, not only that those, who conspire to remove the king out of the government altogether, but that those who conspire to remove him, unless he will govern the people according to laws, which are not statutes in parliament agreed upon, and the laws and customs of the same, or as the head of a government framed and modified by any authority not derived from that parliament, do conspire to depose him from that royal state, title, power, and government, which the indictment mentions, and to subvert and alter the rule and government now established in these kingdoms. He ought not so to govern—I say he cannot so govern—he is bound to resist such a project at the hazard of all its consequences; he must resist the attempt; resistance necessarily produces deposition, it endangers his life. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 19 Gentlemen, to that king, upon whom these duties attach, the law and constitution, for the better execution of them, have assigned various counsellors, and responsible advisers : they have clothed him, under various constitutional checks and restrictions, with various attributes and prerogatives, as necessary for the support and maintenance of the civil liberties of the people: they ascribe to him sovereignty, imperial dignity, and perfection : and because the rule and government, as established in this kingdom, cannot exist for a moment without a person filling that office, and able to execute all the duties from time to time, which I have now stated, they ascribe to him also that he never ceases to exist.. In foreign affairs, the delegate and representative of his people, he makes war and peace, leagues and treaties: In domestic concerns, he has prerogatives, as a constituent part of the supreme Tegislature ; the prerogative of raising fleets and armies: he is the fountain of justice, bound to administer it to his people, because it is due to them; the great conservator of public peace, bound to maintain and vindicate it; every where present, that these duties may no where fail of being discharged; the fountain of honour, oflice, and privilege ; the arbiter of domestic commerce, the head of the national church. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 20 Gentlemen, I hope I shall not be thought to mispend your time in stating thus much, because it appears to me that the fact, that such is the character, that such are the duties, that such are the attributes and prerogatives of the king in this country (all existing for the protection, security, and happiness of the people in an established form of governmen}), accounts for the just anxiety, bordering upon jealousy, with which the law watches over his person—accounts for the fact that, in every indictment, the compassing or imagining his destruction, or deposition, seems to be considered as necessarily co-existing with an intention to subvert the rule and government established in the country: it is a purpose to destroy and to depose Aim, in whom the supreme power, rule, and government, under constitutional checks and limitations, is vested, and by whom, with consent and advice in some cases, and with advice in all cases, the exercise of this constitutional power is to be carried on. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 21 Gentlemen, this language, the tenor and charge of every indictment, is most clearly expressed by lord Hale, when he says that high treason is an offence more immediately against the person and gorernment of the king: I cannot state it more strongly to you, or from an authority, the authenticity of which will be less questioned by those who are to defend the prisoner at the bar, than when I state to you the language of one of the counsel for lord George Gordon upon the last trial for high treason: indeed itis no more than what follows the law of England as delivered by all those great lawyers, whosc authority, I am persuaded, will not be attempted to be shaken in the course of this trial, when it states this principle thus : o compass or imagine the death of the king, such imagination or purpose of the mind, visible only to its great Author, being manifested by some open act, an institution obviously directed not only to the security of his natural person, but to the stability of the government, the life of the prince being so Interwoven with the constitution of the state that an attempt to destroy the one is justly held to be a rebellious conspiracy against the other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 22 Gentlemen, it will be my duty to state to you presently what is in law an attempt against the life of the king. It seems, therefore, that when the ancient law of England, —and I would beg your attention to what I am now stating to you,—that when the ancient law of England was changed, which, even in the case of a subject, held the intent to kill homicide, as well as, in the case of the king, the intent to kill or depose, without the fact, where a measure was taken to effectuate the intent, treason, with a difference however as to the nature of the acts deemed sufficient, in the one case, or in the other, to manifest the one or the other intent, that to use the words of a great and venerable authonity, I mean Mr. Justice Foster, “ it was with great propricty that the statute of treason retained the rigour of the law in its full extent in the case of the king. In the case of him, says he, “ whose life must not be endangered, because it cannot be taken away by treasonable practices, without involving a nation in blood and confusion: levelled at him, the stroke is levelled at the public tranquillity. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 23 Gentlemen, that it may be fully understood what it is that I have to contend for in the course of this trial, I put you in mind again that I have before stated, that, as it is absolutely necessary to the security of individuals, Notless necessary to the security of individuals, than it is necessary to the security of the nation which they compese, that the person and government of the king should be thus defended ; on the other Pie i for the security of the subject, it is equally necessary that the crime of high treason should not be indeterminate, that it should not be unascertained, or undefined, either in the law itself, or in the construction to be made of that law. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 24 Gentlemen, this necessity is not to be collected merely in this country from reasoning, though it may obviously enough be collected from reasoning ; the experience of your ancestors has informed you, I admit it, and I beg to press it upon your attention, as much as any man in this court can press it upon your attention, the experience of your ancestors has informed you, in the just and bitter complaints which are to be found in thcir annals, of the periods, in which no man knew how he ought to behave himself, todo, speak, or say, for doubt of pains of treason,—in the anxiety with which the statute of Edward Srd reserved the judgment of all treasons not there expressly specified—“ that the justices should tarry without going to judgment of the treason, till the cause be showed and declared before the king and his pannel ;—in the expressive language, which your ancestors have used, when the provisions of the statute of Edward were first introduced into the code of law under which we live, and of those statutes, by which treasons were brought back to the provisions of that statute, the experience of your ancestors, thus handed down to you, has demonstrated this necessity. I admit too (and my treating the subject thus in the outset may ultimately save your bathe that before the statute was made, upon whic! the indictment proceeds, the security of the subject was not sufficiently provided for. I admit that security is not sufficiently provided for now, if construction can be allowed to give an exposition to the statute, which the legislature did not intend it should receive. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 25 Gentlemen, upon each of these heads it was necessary for me to trouble you with some, and but with a few observations. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 26 That the law of treason should be determinate and certain, though clearly necessary for the security of the subject, is not more necessary for their security, than that there should be a law of treason, and that this law should be faithfully, duly, and firmly executed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 27 Gentlemen, every state must have some form or regimen of government; in other words, it must determine by whom, and under what modifications, the sovereign power is to be exercised in the country; tor no government can exist, unless this power is placed somewhere: and the attempt to subvert that power is, in the nature of the thing, an attempt to subvert the established government. It is of necessity that an attempt of this sort should be guarded against, by severer penalties than offences, which being breaches of particular laws, do not endanger the very existence of the state itself, which do not involve, in the destruction of the state, the destruction of all laws, but which leave the law, though violated in particular cases, sufficient, in general cases, for the protection of the personal security, the liberty, and happiness of the subject. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 28 Gentlemen, this is also the reasoning of that great judge, whose name I before mentioned to you, my lord Hale : “ The greatness of the offence, he says, “and the severity of the punishment, is upon these reasons: First, because the safety, peace, and tranquillity of the kingdom is highly concerned in the safety and preservation of the person, dignity, and government of the king, and therefore the laws of the kingdom have given all possible security to the king’s person and government, and under the severest penalties. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 29 Gentlemen, to describe this great offence with precision and accuracy, was what the legislature in Edward's time proposed, when they enacted the sacred statute upon which this indictment is founded; that statute was made for the more precise definition of this crime, which, by the common law, had not been sufficiently extended, and “ the plain anextended letter of it, you will mark the words, “ the plain unextended letter of it was thought to be a sufficient protection to the person and honour of the sovereign; but not only to the person and honour of the sovereign, but “ an adequate security to the laws committed to his execution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 30 Gentlemen, in addressing a jury if a court of law, sworn to make deliverance according to that law which constitutes the court in which they sit, there are two propositions, which appear to nf to be alike clear: the first is, that I ought not, that I cannot dare to call upon you to say, that there has been committed under this statute any offence, if the facts of the case to be laid before you, by plain, manifest, authorized interpretation of the statute, do not constitute an offence under it; if the statute should seem to any man, or to you, not to be a sufficient and adequate security to the person and honour of the sovereign, and the due execution of the laws, it is nevertheless all the security which the law has authorized you to give them, and God forbid that you should think of giving more. On the other hand, you are bound by your oaths, if this law has been violated in fact, if the fact of violation is proved by evidence, convincing in its nature, and such in its form as the law requires (for the law in this case requires not only convincing, but formal cvidence), then you are bound to give to the person and honour of the sovereign, and to the laws of your country, that protection, which a verdict, asserting in substance that the statute has been violated, would give, and which the statute intended should be given. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 31 Gentlemen, men of honour and of conscience, acting under the sanction of the oath which they have taken, must come to the same conclusion, judging of the same facts, by the same law, whatever their principles of government may be, unless they differ upon the effect of the tacts laid before them. In the trial of a person, whose name I shall have abundant reason to mention to you in the course of this proceeding, I mean the author of the Rights of Man, charged with a libel against the monarchy of the country, it was judiciously, truly, justly, and strongly adMnitted in effect, that, if the jury had been composed (if there are twelve such men in this country) of republicans, wishing to overturn the government of the country, yet administering the law of England, in a court of English law, if they were convinced that the crime had, according to that law, been committed, no man would have the audacity to say that they. could be capable of that crime against the public, to think for a moment of not coming to the conclusion, which the facts called for, according to the law by which they were sworn to decide upon the matter before them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 32 Gentlemen, the statute upon which this indictment proceeds, is to the following effect : —it states (and it states most truly), “ that divers opinions had been had before this time, that is, the 25th Edward Srd, “ in what case treason should be said, and in what not : the king, at the request of the Lords and of the Commons, hath made a declaration in the manner as hereafter followeth, that is to say, when a man doth compass or imagine the death of our lord the king, or of our lady his queen, or of their eldest son and heir; or ifa man do violate the king’s companion, or the king’s eldest daughter, upmarricd, or the wife of the king’s eldest son and heir ; or if a man do levy war against our lord the king in his tealm, or be adherent to the king’s enemies in his realm, giving to them aid and comfort in the realm or elsewhere, and thereof be provably attainted—by which words I understand be attainted by evidence, that clearly and forcibly satisfies the minds and consciences of those who are to try the fact— “attainted of open deed by people of their condition,—then there is this, to which you will be bound to give your attention for the sake of the prisoner, as well as for the sake of the public, the interests of both being blended in this great cause; “ and because that many other like cases of treason may happen in time to come, which a man cannot think nor declare at this present time, it is accorded that, if any other case, supposed treason, which is not above specified, doth happen before any justices, the justices shall tarry without any going to judgment of the treason till the cause be showed and declared before the king and his parliament, whether it ought to he judged treason, or other felony. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 33 Gentlemen, I desire to point out here, in the most marked way in which I can state it, the anxiety, with which the parliament wished to preserve to itself the judgments of treasons, not being the specified treasons in the statute, but being like treasons, those which, by a parity of reasoning. might be said to be treason. They would not trust the subjects of the country in the hand of any court of justice upon that point I mark the circumstance, because it appears to me to give a degree of authority to the law of England upon the subject of treason, and to the constructions, which have been made upon it, and to the distinctions, which have been made between like treasons, and overt acts of the same treason, that perhaps does not belong to constructions and distinctions adopted in the course of judicial proceedings upon any other law in the statute-book. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 34 Gentlemen, having read the statute to you, it is not unimportant, as it seems to me, to observe that lord Hale and Mr. Justice Foster, who have stated the judicial and other expoweighty caution, which they most powerfull express: under the solemn protests, whic! they most strongly state, against extending this statute by a parity of reason. This circumstance alone appears to me to give infinite authenticity to the expositions, which they state of it, as sound, and as being such as, according to the interpretation, which the legislature in Edward Srd‘s time meant, should be put upon this statute. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 35 Gentlemen, I think it may also save your time, and that of the Court, if I trouble you here by reading, before I state to you the expositions of the statute which lord Hale has given us, deducing them from judgments which had been actually made in the history of the country, the language which he holds, as describing the obligations, which courts of justice, and men looking at this statute for the purpose of executing it, are under, to construe it according to the real specified meaning, not by a parity of construction as to the treason itself, when they came to construe it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 36 Lord Hale states it thus : “ Although the crime of high treason is the greatest crime against faith, duty, and human society, and brings with it the greatest and most fatal dangers tu the government, peace, and happiness of a kingdom or state, and therefore is deservedly branded with the highest ignominy, and subjected to the greatest penalties t the law can inflict, yet by these instances —he is stating those that had occurred before the statute of Edward Srd and between that and the first of Henry 4th—“ yet by these instances, and more of this kind that might be given, it appears—first, how necessary it was that there should be some fixed and settled dary for this great crime of treason, and of what great importance the statute of the 25th of Edward 3rd. was in order. to that end; secondly, how dangerous it is to depart from the letter of that statute, and to multiply and enhance crimes into treason by ambiguous and general words—as accroaching of royal power, subverting of fundamental laws, and the like; and thirdly, how dangerous it is by construction and analogy to make treasons, where the letter of the Law has not done it, for such a method admits of no limits or bounds, but runs as far as the wit and invention of accusers, and the odiousness and detestation of persons accused, will carry men. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 37 In another passage, after having given his comment upon this statute—after havin; stated what are the overt acts, which fa witbin the letter of it, and the sound interpretation of it, he says, “It has been the great wisdom and care of the parliament to Eoep judges within the bounds and express limits of this act, and not to suffer them to run out upon their own opinions into constructive treasons, though in cases that seem to have a parity of reason (like cases of treason), but reserves them to the decision of pare liament. This is a great security as well as direction to judges, and a great safeguard even to this sacred act itself; and therefore, as before I observed, in the chapter of levying of war, this clause of the statute leaves a weighty memento for judges to be carcful that they be not over-hasty in letting in constructive or interpretative treasons, not within the letter of the law, at least in such new cases as have not been formerly expressly resolved, and settled by mere than one precedent. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 38 Gentlemen of the jury, Iam persuaded, as those were persuaded who conducted the defence of lord George Gordon, that we live in days, in which the judges of the country neither have the inclination nor the courage to stretch the law beyond its limits. I think myself bound to state that; and those, who dare to state the contrary in any place, do not do the justice to the country, which is due from every individual in it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 39 Gentlemen, having stated thus much to you, I now state, in order to be perfectly understood, that I do most distinctly disavow making any charge of constructive treason ; that Ido most distinctly disavow stating in this indictment any like case of treason not specified in the statute; that I do most distinctly disavow stating any thing that can be called cumulative treason or analogous treason ; thatI do most distinctly disavow enhancing any thing, by a parity of reason, into treason, which is not specified in that statute ; that I do most distinctly disavow enhancing crimes of any kind, or a life spent in crimes, if you choose so to put it, into treason, if it be not treason specified in the statute ; and the question between us I state distinctly to he this— Whether the defendant is guilty of a treason specified in the statute, and whether the evilence that is to be brought before you amounts to that proof, that will te satisfactory to your minds and consciences, your minds and consciences being prepared to admit no proof, but what you think you ought to reccive under the obligation of an oath, proof high enough that he may be “ provably attainted of open deed, of a treason specified in the statute, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 40 Then, gentlemen, to state the charge to you : The indictment charges the defendant with compassing and imagining the king’s death, and with having taken measures to effectuate that purpose — Now, that it may be thoroughly understood, you will permit me to state to you here, that there is not only a manifest distinction in reason, but a settled distinction in the course of judicial practice, settled for no other cause but that it was a manifest distinction in reason, between—“ like cases of treason, constructive, analogous, or cumulative treasons, and various overt acts of the same treason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 41 Gentlemen, whether the acts laid as overt acts of treason, specified in the statute, and specae! in the indictment, amount, in all eir circumstances, to an open deed, or deeds by which a ae may be provably attainted of the specified treason, is the question which ajury are to try. To explain myself upon this, I take it to be clear, and I will not, in this stage of the business at least, enter intothe discussion of what I call the clear and established law of England, hecause I will not in a case of high treason, any more than I would in a dispute about the estate of any gentleman who hears me, for the purpose of arguing points, enter into discussions upon what I take to be the clear and established law of England; and not only the security of the subject in this respect cannot, but the sesanto the subject in no respect, in his person, his life, or his property, can be taken to exist in this country, if I am not as fully authorized to state to you, with as much confidence, what the law Is, incase of treason, from the decisions, which for centuries have heen tnade in courts respecting it, as [am to state to you, from decisions of courts respectingproneny what the law of property is. I say, take it to be clear that deposing the king, entering into measures for deposing the king, conspiring with foreigners and others to inwade the kingdom, going to a foreign country to procure the invasion of the kingdom, or proposing to go there to that end, and taking any step in order thereto—conspiring to raise an insurrection, either to dethrone the king, imprison the king, or oblige him to alter his measures of government, orto compel him to remove evil counsellors from him, are, and have all been held, as Mr. Justice Foster says, to be deetls proving an intent to do that treason, which is mentioned in the statute to be overt acts of treason in compassing the king’s death, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 42 It would he very extraordinary if these great judges, Foster and Hale, after holding the language they have stated, were to be represented by any man, as not acting themselves under the effect and influence of that weighty memento, which they held out to those who “were to succecd them in the seat of judgment; yet I state all this to you in the words in which ‘these learned judges have handed down the exposition of the statute, who would have suffered death, for they both valued the liberties of their country, before they would have. charged “a like case of treason in an indictment; and yet they have concurred (as all the judges of England have done, and the parliament into the bargain) in the construction and exposition of the statute (and in fact executions have been made upon it), that all these things are overt acts of the same treason, that is specified in the statute. What is the reason of it? because the law holds that he, who does an act, meaning to do it, which may endanger the king’s lite, compasses and imagines the death of the king, if he does an act which may endanger his life, if im the ordinary course of things, and according to the common experience of mankind, the measure which he takes, in pursuance of a purpose to take it, will bring the king to his grave. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 43 This therefore is not raising constructive treason, it is not raising treason by analogy, it is not stating “ like cases of treason not specified in, but reserved by the statute to the judgment of parliament, but it is stating overt acts, which are measures taken in pursuance of treasonable purposes, which measures must necessarily be as various in their kinds, asthe ways and means, by which, in facts and open deeds, taken in pursuance of its purposes, the human heart manifests its intent to commit some one or other of the treasons specified in the statute. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 44 Gentlemen, the reserving clause in the act is extremely material; and, if courts and juries have done wrong in the manner in which they have executed this statute, if the inter. pretatons, which they have made of the statute, are not right, they have done it against a prohibition in the statute, which they were called upon by their oaths duly to expound, and they have done it in the presence and under the eye of that parliament, which had expressly forbidden them to doit. I say the conelusion upon that is, that they have done it rightly. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 45 Gentlemen, the judgments of the courts of law are in this country perfectly familiar to parliavent. Acts have been made, over and over agiin, in order to bring back the expositions of the Jaw to the true construction, to the letter, which is the true construction, in a ; sound Judicial sense, to bring it back againto the statute of Edward Srd; but we have lived to this hour without parliament thinking that they were tomake so perfectly a dead letter of the letter of the statute, as that they should say that an overt act, which expressed and inported the imagination of the mind to do the treason specified, should not be taken to be anact of high treason within the statute ; because the statute only mentions the thing which is to be compassed and imagined, and doc: not mention the ways and means, by whick the human heart may show and manifest that it does compass and imagine what thestatute speaks of. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 46 Gentlanen, this is not all, because this is not only iccording to the law of England, as itis admnistered in courts of justice, but also to the preceedings in parliament, which are a parliameatary exposition, if 1 may so state it, of the lav. Proceedings in parliament have been had where the statute has been thus construe, and where this distinction that I am statirg between overt acts of the specified treason and the “ like cases of treason, hasthe indictment lays the imagining and com. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 47 been expressly taken, expressly acted upon, proposed by one house of the legislature to the other house, and acted upon by the crown in executing the sentences of that house. Gentlemen, the distinction then is only this —“a like case of treason is a case of treason not specified in the statute, a case of the like mischief, as a case specified in the statute; but the identical case specified in the statute must be before yuu, or, to avoid all dispute upon the subject, I say, if it be a case that isnot specified in the statute, it is a case that must be shown to parliament according to the directions of the statute: but that facts alike in their nature, that open deeds alike in their nature and tendency, however various in their circumstances, may prove the same intention to exist in the minds of those who do them, and may be measures, taken in pursuance of the same purpose, and to effectuate the same thing, is a distinction that appears to my mind to be perfectly obvious. Gentlemen, I conccive, therefore, that the uestion of compassing the king’s death is this—whether the jury are fully satisticd, conscientiously satisfied, that they have that evidence, by which they find that the acts, laid as overt acts of compassing the particular specified treason mentioned in the indictment, were measures taken in pursuance of and to effectuate that treason, specified at once in the statute and in the indictment. Gentlemen, I protest for mysclf I am sorry to trouble you thus much at large by general reasoning, but you will find that it has an application, and a close application, to the ease. This is an important public cause, and therefore we should be thoroughly understood, I cannot understand what constructive overt actsmean, though I do understand constructive treasons. Levying war against the kng, not against his person, but against his roya. majesty, is constructive treason ; thatis, if menassemble together without any intent to do an act, which in the natural consequence of things will affect the king's life, such as pullingdown all prisons or houses of any other descristion, that is constructive treason, it being, by construction, as Mr. Justice Foster says, against the king’s royal majesty, not levied against his person : not one of the acts of a more flagitious kind, wilfully done or attempted to be ne, by which the king’s life may he in danger, but which are levelled against lis royal majesty; these have by construction been held to be treason: but even these he legislature has never considered as not atthorized by the letter of the statute ; these tley have permitted to be proceeded upon in the country as sound decisions and constructbns upon the act of parliament: many have teen convicted upon them; execution hath ollowed ; and no one hath ever doubted eithe: the law or the justice of these determinations. But, as to constructive overt acts of canpassing and imagining the death of the king, where passing as the offence, the overt act is not constructive, the step taken to effectuate it must be such an act, wiltully and deliberately done, as must satisfy the conscience of a jury that there was an intention, by deposing, or otherwise, tu put the king in circumstances, in which, according to the ordinary experience of mankind, his life would be in danger. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 48 Gentlemen, I have befure stated to you, for another purpose, various acts, which are overt acts of compassing the king’s death. I will repeat them shortly: “ Deposing him,—entering into measures to uepese him,—conspiring to imprison him,—which you observe is an act that may be done without an actual intent to put him to death—a man may conspire to imprison the king without an actual intent to put him to death, but you will find the reason why that is held to be compassing and imagining the death of the king, with the sanction of all times since this statute of Edward 3rd, and with the sanction of every species of judicial authority, which the country could give; “ to get his person into the power of conspirators. Why is all this treason? ‘ Because, says Mr. Justice Fuster, “ the care, which the law hath taken for the personal safety of the king, is not confined to actions or attempts of a more flagitious kind, such as attempts either to assassinate, or to poison, or other attempts, directly and immediately aiming at his life; it is extended to every thing, wilfully and deliberately done, or attempted, whereby his life may be endangered ; and therefore the entering ints measures for depusing, or imprisoning hira, or to get his persun into the power of the conspirators,—these offences are overt acts of treason within this branch of the statute; for experience hath shown that between the prisons and the graves of princes the distance is very small, and expericnce has not grown weaker upon this subject in modern times; offences which are not so personal as those already mentioned, have been, with great propriety, brought within the same rule, as having a tendency, though not so immediate, to the same fatal end. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 49 Lord Hale, upon this, says, “ Though the conspiracy be not immediately, and directly, and expressly the death of the king, but the conspiracy is of something that in all probability must induce it, and the overt act is of such a thing as must induce it, this is an overt act to prove the compassing of the king’sdeath. The instance he gives, as expository of his text, is this; “If men conspire to imprison the king by force and a strong hand till he hath yielded to certain demands, and for that purpose gather company, or write letters, this is an overt act to prove the compassing of the king's death. What is the reason? he gives the same in substance, though different in the terms of it, as that which has been assigned by Mr. Justice Foster: “ for it is in effect to despoil him of his kingly government. These are the words of lord Hale; and though the reasons given by lord Ilale and Mr. Justice Foster are ditterent in words, they are the same in substance. It may be said, with equal truth, between despoiling a king of his kingly government and the graves of kings the distance is very small. Imprisonment is the same as deposition, and he whu compasses thedeposition of the king, according to all judicial construction, compasses his death; it is ; the same as deposition, because it is a temporary despoiling him of his kingly government, which, according to this interpretation of the ; law, usually ends in death. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 50 Gentlemen, offences not so personal as those enumerated fall within the same rule, as having a tendency to the same fatal end: if foreigners are not at war with you, the offence of guing into a forcign country, or propusing to go there, or taking any step thereto in order to invite foreigners into this kingdui for a treasonable purpose, can only tall within that branch of treason of compassingthe king's death ; if they are at war with you, then the same act amounts to another species of treason, which is an “adhering to the King’s enemies ; and perhaps you will find that the case I have to state is not without pregnant evidence of this species of overt act. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 51 Gentlemen, haying stated thus much to you, I proceed now to consider the indictment; and what I have stated, before I mentioned the substance of the indictment, I have stated to lay in my claim to full credit with you, whenIsay, that no man living can wish to express to you more strongly ! than I wish to do (we have indced, each of us, as great an interest in the true construction of this law, as any other man can have in it), that the law of treason, in considering the charge, that I have brought before you under the command that has authorized me to bring it here, must not be extended one single iota beyond what is the established law in this country, as established as the law is, that says that the property that you bought yesterday, you may give to whom you lease to-morrow. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 52 Gentlemen, the indictment, finding several persons entitled to be tried separately, though Indicted jointly, combined ina particular act, which I will state by-and-hy, has charged them with compassing the king’s death: it has then proceeded, because the compassing and imagination of the heart cannot be known to man—and there must be an overt act to manifest it—it bas charged them with meeting among themselves to cause and procure a convention of divers subjects of the king, to be held within this kingdom, and not only a eonvention to be held within the Kingdom, but to be held with intent and in order that the persons to be assembled at such convention and meeting should and might, wickedly and traitorously, without and in defiance of the authority, and against the will of lhe parliament of this kingdom, subvert and alter the legislature, rule, and goocrnment established in it, and depose the king from the royal state, title, power, and gocernment thereof. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 53 It then charges them with having composed, written, and published, and caused to e composed, written, and published, divers books, pamphlets, letters, instructions, resolutions, orders, declarations, addresses and writings, such books, pamphlets, letters, instructions, resulutions, orders, declarations, addresses and writings, su respectively composed, written, published, and caused to be composed, written, and published, purporting and containing therein (among other things) incitements, encouragements, and exhortations, to move, induce, and persuade the subjects of the king tochoose, depute, and send persons, as delegates, to cumpose, not a convention, but SUCH a convention and mcecting, that is, a convention to act in the manner that the first overt act has stated it, to be holden for the traie torous purposes befure mentioned. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 54 It then states, as a third overt act, consultations among them, how, when, and where, such convention and meeting should be assembled and held, and by what means the subjects of the king might be induced and moved to send persons as delegates to constitute it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 55 It then charges, that these persons did consent and agree, that Mr. Jovce and several other persons named, should meet, confer, and co-operate among themselves and with other traitors, to cause the calling and assembling such convention and meeting for such traitorous purposes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 56 It then charges the providing of arms, of different descriptions, fur these purposes; and then it charges a conspiracy to make war in the kingdom, anditchargesaconspiracy to subvert and alter the legislature aud government of the kingdom, and to depose the king: that is, as I understand it, that, if you should not be satisfied that the calling such a convention, as is mentioned in the first part of the indictment, was a mean to effectuate that compassing and imagination, which is mentioned tn the introductory part of the indictment, yet you will tind in the evidence, which is to be laid before you, even if yor pay no‘attention to that circumstance of calling a convene tion, sutticient evidence of a conspiracy to depose the king. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 57 It then states again, that they published several books, and other matters of the same kind, in order to bring about the traitcruas purposes Jast mentioned ; and charges, as a farther overt act, providing arms fur that purpose. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 58 Now, gentlemen, having before stated to you, that a conspiracy to depose the king,— 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 59 and I have not stated it to you in my own words, but in the words of the authorities I mentioned,—that a conspiracy to depose the king, that a conspiracy to imprison the king, a conspiracy to procure an invasion, with steps taken to effectuate such a conspiracy (a conspiracy indeed itself being a step for that purpose), is treason; you will observe that In this indictment, a conspiracy to depose the king is expressly charged, and, think, it will be clearly proved. If a conspiracy to depose the king be an overt act of high treason, permit me then to ask you, what can a conspiTacy to subvert the monarchy of the country, including in it the deposition of the king, be, but an overtact of high treason? In the object of such a conspiracy the king is necessarily involved, and it is already shown that conspiring to depose him is compassing his death. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 60 Gentlemen, read as you are in the history of the country, give me leave to ask you, if measures had been taken, after the Revolution, to effectuate a conspiracy to dethrone king William, and to restore king James, without all doubt, the measure taken, would have constituted the crime of high treason within the clause of compassing the king’s death, although the conspirators could have been shown satistactorily to have no more meant the actual natural death of king William, than they meant the actual natural death of king James, whom they intended to replace upon the throne—but what says the law to that; the law says you cannot mean to depose the king without meaning to endanger his life, and if you mean to endanger his life you must abide the consequences of it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 61 Put it another way—lIf the project had been to depose the same king William, and measures had been taken upon it—not witha view to bring back to the throne king James 2d, but merely to send back king William to his former character of Prince of Orange, and not to restore king James, but to restore a commonwealth, which is what, I think I shall satisfy you, those, who are charged by this indictment, meant by “a full and fair representation of the people, whether you eall it “ a full and fair representation of the people in parliament, or do not use the words “in parliament, can a lawyer be found to say, that it could be stated in law, that it is not high treason? I do not know what may not be stated—all that I mean to say at present is, that according to the best lights which I can get of the law under which —I have lived, it does not appear to me to be probable, that any man will so state it. Far be it from me, however, to have the vanity to say that (avowing that I should certainly not think of encountering the current authorities of the country for centuries) I am, without the possibWity of contradiction, stating that I am following the authorities of the country for centuries ; but I am ready to say this, that I cannot conceive or imagine by what species of teasoning, or upon what principle, or upon what authority, it is to be contended, that this would not have been high treason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 62 Gentlemen, take it another way—if the regicides ef king Charles 1st had been tried for compassing the death of king Charles 1st, supposing they had only deposed him, instead of putting him to death, could they have contended, that though they would have been guilty of high treason if they had placed another individual upon the throne (which would have been alike to the case I have put, of conspiring to put James in the bps of Wil liam), could they have contended then, that they were not guilty of high treason, because they deposed the king without substituting another king in his place; and because they left the governmentto be filled up by the commonwealth, without a king? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 63 Give me leave to ask another thing—suppose it had happened after king William came to the throne, that not those events, which did actually happen, took place, but that any set of men in this country should have ventured to meet in a convention of delegates from aftiliated societies, for the purpose of deposing king William, under pretence of assembling a convention of the people, havi: or claiming the civil and political authority of the country, and intending to have no king in the country, would it have been possible in king William’s time to have contended, because they met, under pretence of being a convention ef the people, assuming to themselves civil and political authority, and with such meaning, that the conspiracy was not as completely a cempassing the death of king William, as if the conspiracy had been, by the same persons, in the case of affiliated soc eties, forming the like convention of delegates, to bring king James again to the throne? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 64 If I levy war in this country against the king, with intent to bring another upon the throne, 1 am guilty of high treason. IfI levy war, that is an overt act of compassing the king’s death. If I conspire to levy direct war that is a compassing of the king’s death, um less all the branches of the legislature have puta man to death upon anerror. If I hold a fortress against the king to put another upon his throne, I am guilty of high treason. Am I guilty of no offence if I do the same acts not for the!purpose of continuing the monarchy of the country in another person, but for the purpose of destroying the monarchy altogether? What is this but doing an act involving in it high treason, and more? High treason in depusing the king! more—in bringing about all that additional anarchy, which we know, which the experience of mankind Proves to be consequent upon the change, where the change is not only of the persons who administer the government, but of the government itself, if destruction can be called a change? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 65 Gentlemen, to assert therefore that measures, taken for a total subversion of the monarchy of the country, including in it an intention to depose the king (mark the words, I state, including in it an intention to depose the king), are not overt acts of compassing the king's death, merely because the statute of Edward 3rd, has not included all overt acts in words, but as left to juries to determine what are overt acts, by which they can pruvahly attaint—to assert that the statute does not include the case, because it is compassing the death of the king, and more; if this were to be asserted ina court of justice (what is asserted out of a court of justice no man pays much attention to),should certainly say of it, that it was the assertion of those who had ill considered the law; and if asserted out of a court of justice, and with a reference to what isto be done in a court of justice, I should say it deserved to have an observation of a harsher kind made upon it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 66 This indictment, besides charging a conspiracy to depose the king, in express terms, of which I shall insist before you there is abundant evidence, charges a cunspiracy to call a convention against the will, in defiance of, and against the authority of parliament, for the purpose of deposing the king ; it charges farther acts, namely, that they caused to be composed and written divers books, pamphlets, letters, instructions, resolutions, orders, declarations, addresses, and writings, cuntaining incitements, inducements, and exhortations, to move, seduce, and persuade the subjects of the king to send delegates to such convention ; as to whichIsay of many of them, though I did not know their real character till 1 had seen them all together, that they are both overt acts, und evidence of overt acts of high treason, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 67 Now, before I state to you the particulars of the evidence, Iam afraid I must, however pulnfal it i8 to me to ask so great a portion of your attention. trouble you with some gencral observations, that I think will have a tendency to render intelligible to you the cumplicated mass of evidence, which I have to lay before you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 68 Gentlemen, the convention, meant to be called by those who are charged with the conspiracy in this indictment, was, as I collect from the effect of the evidence, a convention of persons, who were to assume the character of a convention of the people, claiming, as such, all civil and political authority, proPosing to exercise it by altering the government, otherwise than by acts of the present constituted legislature, otherwise than by those statutes, according to which the king has sworn at the hazard of his life to govern. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 69 Gentlemen, if this is made out, it appears to me to follow necessarily on the part of all who took a step to assemble it, that they are gucity of a conspiracy to depose the king, to depose him trom the character which he holds in the constitution of the sovereign power of this kingdom, as by law established, that law by which I again repeat to you, he is sworn yo govern. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 70 Gentlemen, if they conspired to assemble ina convention, which was of its own authority, and against the will of the legislature, and in defiance of it, to act as an assembly to constitute a government, and to assume so far sovereign power, it is, I conceive, according to the law of England, a conspiracy to depose from the sovereignty him, who under the restraints of the constitution and the law, now holds that sovereignty. There cannot be two sovercign powers in a state; there may be a complication of authorities vested in a great variety of persons, making up one sovereizn power, but there cannot be two sovereign powers ina state: itisimpoussible. Ifa mecting assembled as a convention of the people, arrogating to themselves all civil and political authority us such, and meaning to exercise it, one or other of these consequences must follow: the king and the parliament must be obedient to the meeting, or the meeting, asscinbled as a convention, must be obedient to flic king and parliament : if the mecting isto be obedient to the king and parliament, it cannot eticct its purposes; it is impossible : if its purpose be to depose the king, I say, a conspiracy to call such a meeting is an overt act of high treason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 71 Gentlemen, I beg your attention to my expressions : if the meeting means to oblige the king and parliament to be obedient to them by the exertion of open force, though it may not effect its purpose, that makes no difference, the law must be the same—I may be wrong Perhaps in stating the law, but it appears to me that the law must be the same if the meeting projects the purpose, whether the force of the meeting is suflicient to effect the Purpose or not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 72 This, I say, is a conspiracy to assume the sovereign power: it is a conspiracy therefore of necessity meant to depose the existing power, and of necessity to depose the king. I say meant to depose; for I repeat it, that whether the conspiracy is successful or not, is immaterial. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 73 Gentlemen, though the particular fact of calling such a convention, now alleged as an overt act of treason, may be represented to be new in the history of this country, it is not therefore, and because it is new only inasmuch as it is more than ordinarily audacious, less an overt act of compassing the death or deposition of the king, if the intent of it was to sub. vert the sovercign ruling power. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 74 Gentlemen, there is another distinction, ta which I would beg your attention. It is of no consequence whether the first meeting, proposed to be assembled, was designed to be a convention, thal should assume all civil and political authority, or was only to detise the means of forming a constituent assembly, u body which should assume it; for any act taken towards assuming it against the will, in defiance of, and against the authority of the king and parliament, and removing him from that situa tion in the character of sovereign, which he has in this country; any act taken towards the formation of a body, which was to assume such authority, is an act of conspiring the deposition of the king: any act towards convening a national assembly, to act with sovereign power, not formed by the legislature, is an act done towards deposing the king, who now has, under the restraints of the constitution, and the provisions and limitations of the law, the sovercign power vestedin him. You cannot set about organizing a body, which is thus to act, without meaning to depose the king, without meaning to form a body that is to usurp the powers of government. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 75 Genticmen, I think the evidence, that I shall lay before you, will most abundantly satisfy you that the convention, which the persous charged conspired to form, was a convention to alter the whole form of the sovereign power of this country, that it was to form, or to devise the means of forming, a representalive government—to vest in a body, founded upon universal suffrage, and ‘the al leged unalienable, and, as they are called, imprescriptible rights of man, al the legislative and executive government of the country ; that aconspiracy to this end would be an overt act of high treason, I presume cannot be disputed; it deposes the king in the destruction of the regal office in the constitution of the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 76 state. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 77 Gentlemen, I go farther: if it had been intended to have retamed the name and office of the king in the country, and to have retained it in the person of the present king, creating, however, by the authority of the intended convention, a new legislature, to act with him, provided they would allow him to act with such new legislature, and thus calling upon him to act against the express obligations of his cororation oath, if he could forget it, it still would have been a conspiracy to depose him from his royal authority, as now established: if he refused to act, he must necessarily be deposed from that authority ; if he did accept, he was not the king of England, as he is established by law the king of England. But he could not accept; he could not so govern; he is sworn not so to govern; he must refuse, must resist, and, in consequence of resisting, his life must be in danger. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 78 Take it either way, that persons conspired to form a convention to assume all civil and political authority, as pretending to be a convention of the people (I care not with how much audacity they pretend to be a convention of the people), or to devise the means of constituting such a convention, in order, and with the intent, and against the authority of parliament, that there should be no king, or in order to the erecting, by their own authority, a new legislature to act together with a king, and together with the king, if they permitted the present to be the king, I submit that such a conspiracy is an overt act in the true construction of law, and high treason in dompassing the king’s death. The king must be deposed while such a new constitution was framing ; he could not treat with such a convention till he had been deposed ; it could be those only, that had sovereign authority, that could frame a constitution: then he is surely, by this, despoiled of his kingly government, even as in a case, of temporary imprisonment. I repeat again, that he could not, consistently with his coronation oath, do otherwise than reject it when framed: it must be taken for granted he would reject it; his life, therefore, could not but be in danger. To suppose that such a meeting, which proposed a new consutution, would depart quietly home, and not act, if it was not accepted, is out of the reach of all human credulity ; itis not according to the ordinary course and experience of mankind, to suppose that they should meet in numbers, and make no use of their numbers, if the show of them did not produce the effect intended : this is not according to the ordinary course and experience of mankind. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 79 Gentlemen, the king in his parliament could not be the sovercign powcr the moment the meeting could act as a national constituting assembly, or could direct, with effect, such an assembly to meet. The power sv to act, or to organize with effect such a meeting that should so act, must pro tempore depose every other power. This 1s the character of a convention of the people, I think, as given in the evidence I have to lay before you. With respect to the detendant, I think I shall satisly you he conspired to call such a convention; and that he said that the convention, which I am to call, is irresistible, it is unlimited, it is uncontrollable, and that by such a convention, my full and fair representalion of the people, or a full and fair representation in parliament (if you choose to take that expression, for it is not mere expression that determines what men mean), is to be accomplished. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 80 Gentlemen, in the country in which I am speaking, when a vacant throne was given (1 am now alluding to the time of king Willian) by those, who, as they are stated in the Bi of Rights, represented all the estates of the people of this realm, to king William and queen Mary, they, who gave it, ceased to have or to exercise the power of sovereignty : in that instant, as every lawyer must speak of it, in that instant the sovereign power of this coon became vested in the king and queen upon the throne, to be exercised in legislation, undoubtedly, with the advice and consent ov parliament, formed according to the Inw and custom of the country—incapable of being exercised otherwise, and, as to the executive authority, exercised under the control of provisions and limitations of the law and constitution, and with the advice which, in every act which the king does, makes somebody responsible. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 81 I insist that the design of conspiring to assemble the people, who were to act as a convention of the people, claiming all civil and political authority, or claiming power to alter, against its will, the constituted legisiature, or a mecting to form the means of bringing together such a convention so to act, Is an attempt to create a power subversive of the authority of the king and parliament, a power, which he is bound by oath to resist at all hazards. But it will not rest here: this will be sufficiently proved; but evidence will likewise be offered to you as satisfactory to prove that the express object of calling this convention, the express object of appointing a committe of conference and co-vperation, which was to devise the means of constituting sich a convention, was ultimately, and finally, and in their prospect, the deposition of the king. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 82 Convene, beyond this, and supposing it not to be proved, the indictment has charged as overt acts, a conspiracy, without the mean of a convention, and not through that enedium, to depose the king; if that consp acy is made out by otheracts, though neither a convention, assuming all political authority, nor a meeting to devise the means of calling a convention, which should assume all political authority, was intended, yet the indictment is made good. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 83 Gentlemen, the indictment farther charges as an overt act of compassing the king’s death, which without question it is, the conspiracy to levy war; I do not mean constructive war. This I state, without question, to be an overt act of compassing the king’s death. A rising to oblige the king toalter his measures of government amounts to levying war within the statute. - A conspiracy to levy war for this purpose is an overt act of compassing the king’s death. If they conspired to form a representative government, excluding the king entirely, which I say is the fact, or, if they conspired not to form a representative government, excluding the king entirely, but yet tocompel him, by their own strength and force, to govern with others, and without those, which he chose to remain with him, by whose advice and consent alone he is sworn and bound to govern, I mean the great council of the nation, the Lords in Parliament assembled, the Commons in Parliament assembled, according to the constitution of the country, and to substitute against his will, and against the will of the present constituted authority of the country another authority, formed on the principles of universal suffrage and annual representation, and so formed without the authority of parliament, I must submit to the court, and to you, that conspiring to do this would be an overt act of treason of deposing the king, and therefore of compassing his death. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 84 Gentlemen, you will also observe the indictment has charged, and proof will be offered to you to make it out, that these objects were meant to be carried by force, by actual force. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 85 Gentlemen, the case, as I have hitherto represented it, is not a case aiming merely at intimidating the legislature, and inducing it by an act done, which was, according to the forms of the constitution, to bury the constitution in its grave, to new-mould the sovereign power; the case goes far beyond this; application in any shape to parliament was not only disavowed, but the very competency of parliament, if applied to, to make a law to new-model the government, was disputed, and denied; the idea of that competency was held to be irreconcilable to the very principle upon which these persons assembled. I must however insist, and I mean to doit, with the full concurrence of my bumble opinion, that a conspiracy to compel the king, by force, inst his will, to give his assent to an act obtained from the Houses of Parliament in order to alter the government and frame of the constitution of the country, whether it was obtained from the two Houses of Parliament, or either of them, by overawing them, or not overawing them,—that a conspiracy, by force, to compel the king, in the exercise of the highest and most essential act of the sovereignty of this country, in the act of giving his consent to such an act,—to compel him, by force, to do that, is unquestionably an overt act of treason in deposing him, and in compassing his death. Itis neither more nor less, to explain it in a word, than to substitute the will of those, who conspired to force him, in the room of that royal will, in which, and by which alone, the laws of this country, and the constitution of this country, have said that a bill (however obtained betore it comes to him) shall receive the authority of a statute. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 86 Gentlemen, I have thought it necessary to state thus much before I come to state the circumstances of the case, and I will state to ae in a word why. It is not to be expected yy persons, who execute the great and important duty in the great and important station, the functions of which you are now called upon to execute, that council at the bar shall be able to state to you law, that no man can question the soundness of: nay, gentlemen, it is not to be expected by you that counsel at the bar should be able to state to you in all cases law, which men of grave character, and excellent understandings, of great reason, and reat experience in their profession, may not ispute the soundness of. It is the duty of counsel, more particularly it is the duty of that counsel, who ought to remember that, if, in Pree the subject, he presses him unfairly, he Betrays in the most essential point the duty which he owes to the soveTeign: it is his duty to endeavour faithfully and honestly to explain and expound the law, that is, to apply to the facts of the particular case, reasoning upon the law, according as he is able to do it, in the exercise of painful industry, exerted under the reflection that be is under much obligation at least to endeavour to represent the law truly. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 87 Gentlemen, I have thought it my duty, in a prosccution, the principles of which interest the civil happiness of all mankind, to mention distinctly and fairly what are the principles upon which I proceed; I have no doubt in my own mind, but that I have stated these doctrines as the law of England would state them, and}I claim from you and from the public that, in the fair exercise of my duty, conducted under such a sense and understanding of that duty, as I have now explained to jou, you and they will do me the credit at leat to think, that the principles whichIhave stated are such as I believe to be sancs tioned by the law of England. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 88 Gentlemen, I shall presume for a moment, after having read to you the indictment, and given you that exposition of it, which I humbly offer to your attention, that the law has (at least, according to my judgment, it certainly has) been complied with in this respect; namely, the indictment has told you with sufficient certainty what it is, that is meant to be imputed as an overt act of com. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 89 passing the king’s death. It is not necessary to be disputing that now, because, if I have failed in the due execution of my duty in that respect, the prisoner cannot be injured by it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 90 Gentlemen, I have before said to you, that, in a case of high treason, the evidence must not only be convincing, but it must be formal ; and, though the object of the security of the person and government of the king is the highest object that the law has looked to, yet I must, at the same time, inform you, that the law for the security of the public which is in truth part of the object involved in the object of the security of the person and government of the king—is essentially united with it—and inseparable from it: the law has required not only that you shall have one witness, if he were the most credible man in the world, to give convincing evidence of the fact, but that that convincing evidence must be rendered yet more conclusive by the testimony of two witnesses; that you should at least have one witness to one overt act, and another to another overt act of the same species of treason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 91 Gentlemen, having stated to you the project, in a general way, to which I apprehend this indictment applies, I presume that you may possibly reason thus: When this indictment charges, that these persons compassed the death of the king, and to depose him,— that they conspired to assemble a convention in defiance of the authority of parliament,— to subvert the rule and government of the kingdom, against the will and in defiance of the legislature,—to dethrone the monarch, reigning in the ‘hearts of a great majority of his people, you will naturally ask,—by what Process was it, that such persons as these could effectuate such a purpose? When the indictment charges, that they composed a great variety of books, containing incitements to choose persons, as delegates, to compose a convention for such traitorous purposes,—in what language, you will naturally ask, could such incitements to such a momentous project, have been conveyed, and to whom could that language have been addressed? When it charges, that they met, and deliberated among themselves, together with divers other false traitors,—at what time, in what manner, and in what place, it may be asked, have these people met to deliberate upon that project, for the accomplishment of which somany persons must be engaged
ATTORNEYGENERAL 93 Now, gentlemen, my answer to this isa short one. I think it will be proved to your Satisfaction, that, as they meant, in the words of the act of parliament, to introduce that system of misery and anarchy, which Prevailed in France, they meant to introduce it by the same means,—to proceed upon the same principles to the same end,—and by the same acts to execute the same purposes. Gentleinen, if the experience of Europe had not manifested what has passed in France (and this project might perhaps be brought from France into Great Britain by but an individual or two), if that experience had not shown us what has passed in France, to the destruction of its old government—to the destruction alike of that government which they substituted in the room of its old government—and which, in the last act of its Power, protested against the existence of clubs, as incompatible with the security of any country, I say, till the subversion of government in France took place, and upon principles, to a blind admiration of which in this country,—a country which, under the pee culiar favour of Providence, is alike in its blessings, as it is inits situation, ‘ toto divisos orbe Britunnos, we have found a disposition to sacrifice all those blessings—it could not perhaps have entered into the heart of man to conceive, that a project so extensive should have been set on fick by persons in number so few; that a project, existing almost every where, should yet be visible no where; that a project should be so deeply combined, and complicated,—should exist to such an almost inconceivable extent,—should be formed with so much political craft—it could not enter into the heart of man to conceive, that it should have existed in any country, much less, that it was possible that it should exist in this country of Great Britain to the extent in which I am sure, whatever your verdict may say upon the guilt of the prisoner, you will be satisfied it has existed in this country. But the law of England does not require that any such case as this should be proved before you. If you are satisfied that what the indictment charges was imagined, and that a step was taken to effectuate that intent, it is enough—it is not the extent, in which the project was proceeded upon—it is not the extent to which the project was Tuinous —it is not necessary to prove, that the Means were as competent to the end proposed, as they were thought to be, by those who used them. No, gentlemen, the providence of the law steps in upon their first motion, whether they furnish themselves with means adequate or inadequate to their purposes—the law steps in then, conceiving its rovidence at that moment to be necessary be the safety of the king and the security of the subject. The project, the general character of which I shall give you, proving it by the particular facts, and applying the particular facts (for I have no right to give you the general project, unless I can so apply the particular facts) to the person now accused, seems to me to have been this.. Imported from France in the latter end of the year 1791 or 1792, by whom brought hither : does not much matter, the intent was to constitute in London, with alliliated societies in the country, clubs which were to govern this country upon the principles of the French government, the alleged unalienable, imprescriptible rights of man, such, as they are stated to be, inconsistent in the very nature of them with the being of a king or of lords in a government—deposing, therefore, the moment they come into execution, in the act of creating a sovereign power, either mediatcly or immediately, the king, and introducing a republican government with a right of eternal reform, and thercfore with a prospect of eternat revolution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 94 Gentlemen, we have all heard of a club called the Jacobin Club at Paris. This, with its affiliated societies,—however impossible it was thought that it should effect such things, —however wild the man would have been thought, into whose head such an imagination could have entered as that it could effect them, first overset the old constitution, then introduced another, which could not exist upon the principles which gave it birth, and has finally introduced government after governmeat, till it has at last Ieft the country in that undescribable state of things in which we now see it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 95 Gentlemen, the great end of the persons concerned in this project, though not altogether visible, or not much disclosed upon its first formation, was, when they had sufliciently diffused their principles through this country, by artifice,—by union,—by combination, — by affiliation, —by fraternization (those who formed the project, whuever they were, endeavouring tu force it into execution by means which perhaps would shock the minds of men that are not always dwelling upon political subjects), to assemble a convention of delegutes from clubs, to assume the power of the people, supported in the assumption and exercise of that power by the individual members of the afhliated socicties, and by their combined strength. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 96 Gentlemen, we have no occasion in this cause to-be disputing upon abstract questions, as to the power of the people to change their government. I state to you, that the intention was, to asscmble a convention of delegates from those clubs, to assume the powers of government. The people, the infinite majority of the people adverse to any change, distinguishing between abuses in the administration of the government, and vices in the form of the government administered, nay, ardently attached to the old government, must have been averse to have been subdued by a convention of the delegates from these societies, who meant to have assumed the representation of the people, and to have exercised the powers which they stated to be inherent in those whom they professed to represent. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 97 Gentlemen, it is not difficult to conceive, after what has happened in fact in France, how it should happen that the opinion of these fraternizing societies should have the force of the will of a majority of the nation, though they constitulcd a vast and infinite minority indeed. You will tind, in the evidence to be laid before you, that it was perfectly understood how this might be by those who are named in this indictment. The great bulk of the community, engaged in different pursuits, are therefore incapable of being combined in opposition to the execution of a purpose, which is to be brought about by great bodies of men, that are combined. I need not give you a stronger instance of it than this : It is within the memory of most of us living, that a few thousand men in St. George’s-fields, combined in one purpose, reduced this metropolis to an absolute state of anarchy, a state in which no government existed. If any man had been asked, a fortnight before the event to which I am now alluding, Is it possible for four or five thousand men to assemble in St. George’s-fields, and to rob and plunder every body they choose in London and ten miles round it? That would have been thought utterly impossible—but yet it happened—why? because a combination of the few will subdue the many, who are not combined, and with great facility; and combined bodies of men have had, as you will find, an existence in this country, to an extent which few men had any idea of. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 98 You will find them organized,—prepared for emergencies and exigencies,—relying upon their own strength,—determined to act upon their combined strength, in a system of acting together,—in some instances acting with a secrecy calculated to elude observation—in other instances, procceding, by directly contrary meaus, to the same end,—representing their numbers as greater than they were, an therefore increasing their number by the very operation of the intluence of the appearance of strength upon the minds of others, without a possibility that that misrepresentation should be set right. You will find them intlaming the ignorant, under pretence of enlightening them; debauching their principles towards their country, under pretence of infusing political knowledge into them; —addressing themselves principally to those whose rights, whose interests are, in the eye uf the law and constitution of England, as valuable as those of any men, but whose education does nut enable them immediately to distinguish between political truth and the misrepresentations held out to them,—working upon the passions of men, whom Providence hath placed in the lower, but useful, and highly respectable situations of life, to irritate them against all whom its bounty hath blessed by assigning to them situations of rank and property,—representing them as their oppressors, as their enemies, as their plunderers, as those whom they should not suffer to exist; and, in order, at the same time, to shut out the possibility of correcting original error, or rectifying the opinions of those whom they had so inflamed, misinformed, debauched, and misled, not admitting them into these affiliated societies till they had subscribed tests— the principles of which they were not to examine after they bad been admitted, but the principles of which they were to carry into execution, when assembled in a convention to carry into execution those principles, as acting for the people, by a great majority of whom they were held in utter detestation. Gentlemen, to say that an act done was meant to be done as a means taken in the execution of such a project as this is, till the person, who takes it, thinks the scheme practicable, I admit is not reasonable, but -undoubtedly he may think it practicable long before it is really so. Now, you will be abundantly satisfied, that these conspirators thought that the time was now come—that the time for a convention, which had been the object of anxious expectation, doubting for a year or two whether it would ever be gratified, that that time was now come, and the measures taken were taken upon that snnposten that the Se ereny had arrived, which, if not laid hold of now, would be lost for ever. Gentlemen, the people of this country have in general a rooted attachment to its government. The public opinion of government is in this country, as well as in every other, its principal support: and therefore it became necessary to infuse, where so much could be safely suggested, where the mind was prepores for it, an opinion, thut the form of the ritish government was radically vicious— that it was-founded on principles of oppression—that it was founded on the destruction of natural, imprescriptible, and unalienable rights. —With others, you will find, they thought it necessary to use a little more cau-. tion— not to alarm them, but to humour their attachment to the form of the constitution, by taking advantage of well-meaning ignorance, under pretence of instructing it, to enlist them also alike in the project of destroying that constitution to which they were attached. To them, therefore, the form of the government was not spoken of in terms which they might understand to be a condemnation of it, though they were really such, but by making use of general expressions, such as obtaining “a full and fair representation of the people in patliament—" a full representation of the people, sometimes without mention of parliament—never with actual mention of the King and Lords, as co-existing together with parliament; by using terms, which certainly may mean what it may be contended in the defence they did mean; but terms the same in their expression, certainly the same in their import, as those which were usedin every act which passed in this country during the time of the Commonwealth, when we neither had King nor Lorde; that may signify a government existing without Lords or King, by declaring the obtaining such a representation of the people as necessary to the natural, unalienable, imprescriptible rights of man, as stated by Mr. Paine: by these means and artifices, they attempted to engage in their service the physical strength of men who might not and did not discover the real nature of the plan, which that strength was to be employed in executing; who fad not information enough to discover what the representation was meant finally todo or to execute. But you will find the persons mem tioned in this indictment had no doubt about it. I mark these circumstances to you, because, in the evidence that is to be laid before you (and I am now stating the general character of the evidence, and not the principles upon which the charge is made), in the evidence to be laid before you of the plan for the execution of these purposes, some very rematkable particulars occur; and when you eome to decide upon this case, I humbly hes your attention to those particulars; some very remarkable particulars will occur. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 99 You will find that the ledding clubs, by which I mean the Constitutional Society, judging of its conduct for the purpose of this cause, though in some other cases we must go farther back, but, for the purpose of this cause, judging of its conduct from about the beginning of the year 1792, and the London Corresponding Society, which was formed, whether created, I will not say, but which was modelled by some leading members of the Constitutional Society, and received its corporate existence, if I may use the term, as it will be proved, under their own handwriting; most distinctly from the handwriting of some, who yet belong, and some, who have ceased to belong to the Constitutional Society; these leading societies, you will find, enlisting into their affiliation many societies in the country, composed of men who expressed their doubts as to the views of these societies in London; who expressed their fears as well as their doubts about those views; who required information as to the purposes of those societies in London; some of these societies in the country professing one set of principles, some another; but al assistance is taken that is offered: accordingly you will see, that the London societies enlist persons who profess, “ that they ought to submit to no power but what they have themselves immediately constituted: to these they give answers, couched in dark, cautious, prudent, but satisfactory and intelligible terms: those who profess still to have attachments to the monarchy of the country, and who express apprehensions about its safety from the principles of the London societies, and the conflicting principles of various country societies, they sooth into fraternization, by telling them that all would be set right “ by a full and fair representation of the people in parliament ;—a name which was given to the uy 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 100 Commons under Cromwell, as well as to the legitimate parliaments of this country at different periods,—without telling them either what these words meant, or how that parliament was to operate to reconcile these differences, which you will find amounted only to the differences between an attachment to an absolute republic, and an attachment to a limited monarchy. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 101 They enlist alike those, who expressed a wish to know whether they proposed to reform the House of Commons, and those who wished to know whether they intend to rip up monarchy by the roots ; their answers were calculated to satisfy each of them, to satisfy whatever might be the disposition of those, who address the questions to them, eee information upon subjects so totally different. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 102 Gentlemen, this is not all: you will find again, that for these purposes, publicationsupon the government of the country, which are alluded to in this indictment, and which will he given to youin evidence, that publications upon the government of the country were adopted by those societies as their own, and circulated, if I may so express myself, ina mass round the country, circulated in a manner, that totally destroys the liberty of the press in this country
ATTORNEYGENERAL 104 Gentlemen, with respect to many of these pobliations 1 may take notice of what has happened in the history of this country, and though no man wishes less to talk of himself than I do, yet I am speaking in the presence of many, who have heard me both in court and in parliament respecting those publications to which I allude (aiid which will be offered to you in evidence), express the difficulty that my mind laboured under to concede that such a publication as the Address to the Addressers, was not, according to law, an overt act of high treason
ATTORNEYGENERAL 106 Gentlemen, you will also not fail to observe (and I state it as a general feature and charaeter of the evidence that I have to lay before you)—the malignant art, and if I may so express myself, the industrious malignity, with which discontent has been spread by these two societies in London, and the means of spreading it have been studiously and anxiously taught from society to society: the means of spreading sedition, fresh as from London, in every town, all with reference (for they are not material, if you do not find they had such a reference) to the final accomplishment of the same purpose: you will not fail to observe how the passions and interests of individuals have becn assailed, and the method of assailing them taught, according to their stations in life—not merely upon government, —but, for the purpose of subverting government, upon tithes—corn-bills—taxes—gamelaws—impress service—any thing that could be represented as a grievance, as well as the government itself, and to this intent—that, in aid and assistance of each other, societies, as they expressed it, ‘might overspread the whole face of the island, and “ that the island might become free —you will mark their expressions—“ by the same means by which France became so. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 107 Gentlemen, in stating to you the character of the evidence, it is necessary for me to make one observation, and it is the last I shall trou ble you with: it is with respect to the principles upon which construction is to be given to the written evidence that will be adduced in this cause. Now I desire to state this to your minds as a principle perfectly reasonable in the administration of justice towards men, who are called upon to answer for offences that the language which they use, ought to be considered according to its obvious sense. If the language admits, and naturally admits, of a double interpretation, it must then be considered according to the nature of the principle which that language is calculated to carry into execution; each paper must be considered with reference to the context of the same paper, and with reference to the contents of all other papers that form the evidence of the same system, which the paper produced is meant to prove. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 108 Now, if you shoyld find that, in detailing the objects of this society, in detailing when my mind, to state satisfactory reasons why itthey meant to do, and in detailing how they meant to execute what they purposed, they should in fact have stated that they meant neither that which was legal,—nor that which was constitutional,—nor that which was other than treason, it will be in vain that they have thought fit (for the greater prudence, the greater care, and the greater caution which you will have most abundant evidence to prove wey exercised occasionally, but add to the guilt by increasing the danger) to assert at other times, when they have used general language, that what they meant to effect was legal and that they meant to effect it ina legal and constitutional manner. It will become them who have the defence upon their hands, to state to you how, ina legal and constitutional manner those things could be done, which were intended to be done, and which this indictment states were intended to be done, if I prove to your satisfaction that they were intended to be done by the means and instruments, which the indictment refers ado. Gentlemen of the jury, their principle, as you will find, was, that equal active citizenship is the right of all men, and that upon this principle their representation of the people wasto be asked for. Now, it requires no reasoning to state, that a representation of the people founded upon the principle of equal active citizenship of all men, must form a parliament into which no King, nor Lords, could enter. There is an end of equal active citizenship the moment that either of them exists, according to my construction of equal active citizenship, and according to their construction of it; for they state that the effect of itis a representative government. But it is not enough for me to tell you, that, in reasoning, this is the consequence; it is a circumstance to be taken into your consideration ; but I say I shall satisfy you, if 1am bound to go farther, that the application of the principle of equal active citizenship, according to them, was to be the foundation of a representative government, rejecting the King and Lords out of the system. The principles were the principles upon which the constitution of France, in the year 1791, was formed: the principles of that constitution were the principles of equal active citizenship: they attempted indeed to provers a king in the constitution, and to form what I may call a royal democracy: but I shall prove to demonstration, that the leaders of these clubs in London knew that that constitution could not exist, that their principles led them to a distinct knowledge that that constitution could not exist: it was in the month of August 1792 entirely overturned; and you will find from the transactions of this society in the months of October and November 1792, unless I mistake the effect of the evidence, the clearest demonstration that these societies meant in applying those principles, which they themselves state had destroyed the existence of a king in France, because they must destroy the existence of a king in any country,—you will find that, from October 1792 at least, these societies meant to destroy the king in this country, and that this was the natural effect of their own principles, as they understood them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 109 Gentlemen, you will now give me leave to state to you, as wellas I can, and as intelligibly as I can, the mass of evidence, and the case which I have to lay before vou. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 110 The particular act, the nature of which will be to be explained by all the rest of the evidence, which has led to the including these particular persons in one indictment, arose out of a letter, dated the 27th of March 1794, which was written by the prisoner, then the secretary of the London Corresponding Society, to the society for Constitutional Information. The words of it are these : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 111 “ I am directed by the London Corresponding Society to transmit the following resolutions to the Society for Constitutional Information, and to request the sentiments of that society respecting the important measures which the present juncture of affairs seems to require. The London Corresponding Society conceives that the moment is arrived — mark the words; for, in the rest of what I have to state, you will frequently hear of the time to which that allen when a full and explicit declaration is necessary from all the friends of freedom, whether the late illegal and unheard of prosecutions and sentences shall determine us to abandon our cause, or shall excite us to pursue a radical reform with an ardour proportionale to the magnitude of the object, and with a zeal as distinguished on our part as the treachery of others in the same glorious cause is notorious. The Society for Constitutional Information is therefore ree quired to determine whether or no they will be ready, when called upon, to act in conjunction with this and other societies, to obtain a fair representation of the people. Gentlemen, give me your attention presently to what they conceive to be a fair representation of the people, when I come to state the resolutions which they transmit! “ Whether they concur with us in seeing the necessity of a speedy Convention for the purpose of obtaining, (then they use the words), “ in a constitutional and legal method—of the effect of which you will judge presently, for the method will not be the more constitutional and legal for their calling it so, if the method is in fact unconstitutional and illegal—“ a redress of those grievances under which we at present labour, and which can only be effectually removed by a full and fair representation of the people of Great Britain. ‘fhe London Corresponding Soeiety cannot but remind their friends that the present crisis demands all the prudence, .unanimity, and vigour, that ever may or can be exerted by men or Britons; nor do they doubt but that manly firmness and consistency will finally, and they believe shortly, terminate in the full accomplishment of all their wishes, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 112 They then resolve, and these resolutions are enclosed: “ 1st, That dear as justice and liberty are to Britons, yet the value of them is comparatively small without a dependance on their permanency, and there can be no security for the continuance of any rights but in equal laws. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 113 “ 9d, That equal laws can never be expected but by a full and fair representation of the people ; to obtain which, in the way pointed out by the constitution,—you will see what that is in the third resolution—“ has been and is the sole object of this society ; for this we are ready to hazard every thing, and never but with our lives will we relinquish an object which involves the happiness, or even the political existence of oursclves and posterity. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 114 “ rd, That it is the decided opinion of this society, that, to secure ourselves from the future illegal and scandalous prosecutions, to prevent a repetition of wicked and unjust sentences, and to recall those wise and wholesome laws which have been wrested from us, and of which scarcely a vestige remains.— Gentlemen. you will permit me to call your attention to what the cuiects were which were to be accomplished—“ there ought to be immediately,—what
ATTORNEYGENERAL 116 ? And what are the purposes which this convention, which they themselves represent as a convention of the people, are to execute? Why they, the delegates, forming a convention of the people, are to recall those wise, wholesome laws, which they say have been wrested from them. Before I have done, I shall prove distinctly that this iy the meaning of the passage, and the meaning of the passage will be to be collected from the whole of the evidence undoubtedly, not from this particular part of it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 117 The Constitutional Society, there being present at that time six of the persons mentioned in this indictment, without any deliberation whatever upon a proposition so material as this is—and therefore it must be left to you, upon the whole of the evidence, whether it is fairly to be inferred or not, that this, like a-great many other papers of the London Corresponding Society, really came from the Constitutional Society—they immediately ordered that their secretary shall acquaint the London Corresponding Society, that they had teceived their communication, that they heartily concur with them in the objects they have in view, and that for that view, and for the purpose of a more speedy and effectual co-operation, they invite them to send to this society, next Friday evening, a delegation of some of their members. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 118 Without now going into the particulars of what followed upon this, give me leave to state, that some members of the society, included in this indictment, were named to compose that delegation; that there was named at the same time a Committee of Correspondenee of six members of this society; that afterwards the London Sareronding Society formed another cemmittee ; t two committees met; that the two committees meeting, came to a determination that this project of calling a convention of the people should be carried into effect; and then, that a joint committee of co-operation of both societies was formed by resolutions of both. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 119 Having stated what happened upon the 27th of March 1794, and connecting it, as I shall do presently, with the very singular facts, which you will find also happened in that year, you will give me leave, in order to show what the true construction of this act is, as well as to state the nds upon which the indictment, even without this act, charges a conspiracy to depose the king—you will give me leave to state the transactions of these societies from the month of Mareh 1792. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 120 Gentlemen, in or about the month of March 1792,—whether before that time the Londoa Corresponding Society had existed oF not, seems to me to be dubious, and therefore I will make no assertion of that one way or other; but supposing it to have existed, it will be made extremely clear that this suciety existed at that time without a constitution, as they call it, and was indebted te a gentleman of the name of Tooke for the constitution under which the society was modified, and was indebted, I think, to a gentleman of the name of Vaughan, for his assistance in the composition of the code of its laws. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 121 The first correspondence that I find between the Constitutional Society, and the London Corresponding Society, which I have to state to you, is in the communication of the principles of the Corresponding Society, sent with a letter signed by the prisoner at the bar, which letter is in the following words: “I am ordered by the committee to send to the Society for Constitutional Information in London a copy of our motives for associating, and the eeohutions we have come to: we mean to persevere in the cause we have embarked in, that is, to have (if possible) an equal representation of the people of this nation in pare liament. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 122 I observe here for a moment that you will not be surprised, when I get to the conclusion of this business, that this cautious language was used in the outset: it will be for you to judge whether a studied caution is fairly imputable to the language. It proceeds thus: ‘We should be exceedingly happy to enter into a correspondence with that sdciety, if it is not too much presumption in us to expect such an honour; but, as our cause is one, we hope that they will deign to take some notice of us, who are now entering upon a matter of such vast importance. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 123 This is extremely condescending language on the part of Mr. Hardy te the Constitutional Society ;‘it accompanies the resolutions of that society, which resolutions purported to be signed “ Thomas Hardy, secretary. It happened, by an accident not very easy to be accounted for at present, and, notwithstanding which, I shall prove distinctly to you that the resolutions are the act of Mr. Hardy: thet this signature—“ Thomas Hardy, secretary — ie a signature, as I am instructed, in the hand-writing of Mr. Horne Tooke; that is, Mr. Hardy in the London Corresponding Society, sends the resolutions of the London Corresponding Society (apologizing extremely for the liberty he takes in presuming to send them) to the Constitutional Society, the sigNature to those resolutions bearing the name of Thomas Hardy in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke: whether those resolutions were finally settled by that gentleman or not, I do not knew ; but you will find that there exists a paper which contains, I think, distinct evidence upon the face of it, that those resolutions have been settled, with a deal of deliberation, by the same gentleman whose hand-writing occurs in the signature which I have been stating. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 124 Gentlemen, before these resolutions were sent, and before I state the matter of them to you, you will allow me to mention that there ad been a correspondence between other svcieties, and the Society for Constitutional Information, of such a nature, as, in order to make this case intelligible, will require some observations from me, and some attention from you; itis the correspondence of other societies, but which correspondence I shall connect in such a manner with the London Corresponding Society, as in fact to make the acts of the other societies the acts of that society. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 125 Upon the 23rd of March 1792, with a view to show you what were the principles of this Constitutional Society, I must state, that they come to a resolution, hat the thanks of this society be given to Mr. Thomas Paine, for his most masterly book intituled, The Rights of Man, in which not only the malevolent soplistries of hireling scribblers are detected, and exposed to merited ridicule, but many of the most important and beneficial political truths are stated so irresistibly convincing as to promise the acceleration of that not very distant period, when usurping borough-sellers and protligate borough-buyers shall be deprived of what they impudently dare to call their Propertyethe choice of the representatives of the people. The Constitutional Socicty cannot help expressing their satisfaction that so valuable a publication has Proceeded trom a member of that society, and they sincerely hope, that the people of England val give that attention to the subjects. discussed in Mr. Paine’s treatise, which their manitest importance so justly deserves. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 126 Then they resolved, for what purpose you will judge of, when I come to state to you the subsequent evidence in this business—“ That the foregoing resolutions, and all future proceedings of this society, be regularly transmitted by the secretary to all our corresponding constitutional societies in England, Seotland, and France. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 127 Now, gentlemen, as I shall prove what the book was to which this resohition alluded, I shall take the liberty at present to state in a few words to you, as far as they affect the existenee of a king in this country, those subjects, which, according to the language of this resolution, the Constitutional Society sincerely hope that the people of land would give attention to, as discussed in Mr. Paine’s first book. In that book these doctrines, with respect to Great Britain, are laid down: “a constitution is not a thing in name only, but in fact; it has not an ideal, but a real existence ; and you will find this extremely imt, because in the result of the whole evidence that I have to lay before you, it will appear that they did not only distinctly disavow making any application to parliament, but the competence of parliament to de any thing by way of reform, because the country had as yet no constitution formed by the people. Mr. Paine proceeds: “Can Mr. Burke produce the English constitution? If he cannot, we may fairly conclude that no such thing as a constitution exists. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 128 After stating that the septennial bill showed that there was no such thing as a constitution in England, the book states a farther fact, not immaterial, that the bill which Mr. Pitt brought into parliament some years ago to reform parliament, was upon the same erToneous principle, that is, upon the principle that patliataene was able to reform itself. With respect to other subjects, to which the attention of the people of England wascalled, you will find that this book, speaking of modes of government (and this is also extremely material with reference to the construction of what is afterwards to be stated to you), represents that “the two modes of government which prevail in the world are, frst, governments by election and representation ; secondly, governments by hereditary succession: the former is generally known by the name of republican, the latter by that of monarchy and aristocracy. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 129 He divides government into government by election and representation; a representation founded upon election, and election founded upon universal suffrage; and government by hereditary succession. He then states that, from the revolutions of America and France, and the symptoms that have appeared in other countries, it is evident the opinion of the world is changing with respect to government, and that revolutions are not within the progress of political calculation; and that the British government, not existing upon the principles he recommends, is not a government existing upon such principles that a nation ought to submit to-it; and that the liament of the country is not able to form a government, that will exist upon those pripciples. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 130 Gentlemen, it is a very remarkable circumstance, as it strikes me, that, though various societies had existed in other parts of Great Britain, till about the time of the formation of the London Corresponding Society, none of these societies had asked or invited affiliation with the London Constitutional Society, which you will find they all ask and all invite about March 1792, whether by management or not, I do not pretend to determine, it will be for you to judge; but they all ask and all invite affiliation with the Constitutional and Corresponding Societies, as soon as the latter is formed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 131 Upon the 16th of March 1792, you will find a resolution of the society for Constitutional Information, which states and returns thanks fora communication from Manchester, signed “ Thomas Walker, president, and “Samuel Jackson, secretary ; in which they return the thanks of the society to Mr. Thomas Paine, who appears to have been aa member, a visitor of this Constitutional Society, “ for the publication of his Second Part of the Rights of Man, combining Principle and Practice. I shall endeavour to state to you in a few words what is the combination of the practice stated in the Second Part of the Rights of Man, with the Lib in the First Part, “a work, they say, “ of the highest importance to every nation under heaven, but particularly this, as containing excellent and practicable plans for an immediate and considerable reduction of the public expendigure for the prevention of wars, for the extension of our manufactures and commerce, for the education of the young, for the comfortable support of the aged, for the better maintenance of the poor of every description, and, finally, for lessening, greatly, and without delay, the enormous load of taxes, under which this country at present labours. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 132 “ That this society congratulate their country at large on the influence which Mr. Paine's publications appear to have had in procuring the repeal of some oppressive taxes in the present session of parliament ; and they hope that this adoption of a small part of Mr. Paine’s ideas will be followed by the most strenuous exertions to accomplish a complete reform in the present inadequate state of the representation of the people, and that the other pest plans of public benefit, which Mr. Paine has so powerfully recommended, will be speedily carried into effect. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 133 ow, gentlemen, as Mr. Paine’s plan for the remedy of the present inadequate state of the representation of the people was alluded to, and this book was alloted to, which combined “ principle and “ practice, and as it is stated that the other great plans of public benefit, which he had so powerfully recommended, would be speedily carried into effect, it will be necessary to show you, from this letter, what were those plans for the remedy of the inadequate state of the representation of the people, and other plans of public benefit, which this society, recciving the thanks of the Constitutional Society, hoped would be carried into effect. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 134 Gentlemen, I do not take up your time in stating the passages to you, but represent to you the substance of that book; that itis a k distinctly and means recommending the deposition of the king : if the passages in that book do not prove that assertion, there is no evidence that can prove any assertion : it is a book, moreover, which not only puts the king out of the system of the government of the country, but, according to which, if'a perfect representation of the people is to be formed, it 1s to be formed not by a parliament existing in a country—in which that gentleman states that no constitution exists—not by that parliament, which he states to be totally aud a solutely inadequate to the great work of forming the constitution upon the nights of man and equal active citizenship, which he recommends: it is a work, which calls upon the people of England to do themselves justice in another way of proceeding, and to form a constitution for themselves before they can have any government, which is to exist upon true principles. There is then, I say, in the beginning of this thing, a developement of these purposes; and I say, beyond that, that if I understand the effect of evidence at all, I shall satisfy you that those, who voted this resolution of thanks, knew that the principles there referred to, were principles that would have this operation, and meant that they should have this effect. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 135 The next thing I have to state, which I shall not go through very particularly, is contained in a resolution of the Constitutional Society (some of the members of which, I shall prove to you, began to leave the society about this time, stating distinctly that they understood its principles to be now different from the principles it had formerly acted upon, and to be such principles as I have stated) entered into upon the 23rd of March 1792. They resolved that another communication, which is from Sheffield, should be published in the Morning Chronicle, and in several other newspapers, which they, mention. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 136 With respect to the communication from Sheffield (and it is a remarkable thing that, from Shefteld, and from Norwich, they should be writing, on the same day, for the same urpose—that the societies of Sheffield and Nomick might be affiliated with the London Constitutional Society, and the Sheffield peo ple were so anxious about it, if it were their own act and deed, that they wrote more than ope letter in order to ask it), it is to this ef ect: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 137 “ Itis now about four months since this society first formed itself into a regular body 5 they were then but very few in number; the encleeed will inform you of their increase, and, which is most probable, will soon become very numerous ; and not only this large and populous tewn, but the whole neighbourfor many miles round about, have an attentive eve upon us: most of the towns and villages indeed are forming themselves into similar associations, and strictly adhere to the mode of copying after us: you will easily conceive the necessity for the leading members of this body to pay strict attention to good order and regularity, and the need we have of consulting and communicating with those who are sincere friends and able advocates for the same cause ; for these reasons we took the liberty to write to Mr. Horne Tooke, that worthy friend and patriot for the rights of the people, informing him of our earnest desire of entering into connexion with the society of the same denomination of ours in London; his very obliging and affectionate answer favours us with your address; in consequence, we have taken the liberty herewith to transmit to yu some resolves, which were passed at our last meetings by the whole body, and the committee was charged with the dispatch of panne and forwarding them to you accordingly, for the purpose of submitting them to the consideration of your society, and to make use of them as they think most prudent. You will also notice the Belpar address: they applied to us about two months ago for instructions as to our mode of conducting, &c. had not then formed themselves into any regular association. Belpar is nearly thirty miles from this place, in Derbyshire, and eight or ten miles from Derby. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 138 “ If the society for Constitutional Information in London should vouchsafe so far to notice us, as to enter into a connexion and correspondence with us, it cannot fail of proMoting honour, and adding strength to our feeble endeavours, and to the common cause, which is the entire motive we have in view. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 139 They then, upon the 14th of March, 1792, knowing that there was a connexion between the London Constitutional and London Corresponding Society (and that they should know that fact on the 14th of March, which is sixteen days before the Soth, when Mr. Hardy sent to Mr. Tooke the resolutions which were signed in the name of Mr. Hardy by Mr. Tooke, as a communication to him that there was such a body as the London Corresponding Society, is a circumstance that affords observation); they then add, “ We have taken the liberty of enclosing a parcel for Mr. Hardy, in answer to a letter from him to this society, requesting some information concerning our method of conducting the business we had embarked in, &c. also informing us there are in London a number of mechanics, shopkeepers, &c. forming themselves into a society on the broad basis of the rights of man. You will be so obliging as to let the packet remain with you until he call for it, as by this post I have wrote him thereof. We have given him our manner of proceeding from our setting out to this time, and hope it may be of some use. The improvement we are about to adopt is certainly. the best for managing large bodies, as in great and populous towns, viz. dividing them Into small bodies or meetings of ten persons each, and these ten to appoint a delegate; ten of these delegates form another meeting and so on, delegating from one to another, till at last they are reduced to a proper number for constituting the committee or grand council. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 140 There is another letter of the same date, which has a remarkable circumstance about it. It is addressed to the Constitutional Society. gentlemen, it states that “ this soe ciety, that is, the same Sheffield Society, “ feeling, as they do, the grievous effects of the present state defects and abuse of our country, —(the word originally in this letter was cone stitution, but the word constitution, not bein, that which was liked, by some very odd accident in the letter from Sheffield, the word country, in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke, is substituted for constitution )—“ the great and heavy oppressions, which the common people labour under, as the natural consequence of that corruption, and at the time being sensible to a degree of certainty, that the public minds and the general sentiments of the ple are determined to obtain a radical reform of the country, you will mark these roe “ as soon ag prudence and discretion wil. permit, believes it their duty to make use of every prudent means, as far as their abilities can be extended, to obtain so salutary and desirable an object, as a thorough reformation of our country, the word country being again in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke, “ estas blished upon that system, which is consistent with the rights of man,’—for these reasons they state their forming into clubs, as the former letter did, and they conclude thus— “ that being thus strengthened, this rromck 4 may be better enabled to govern itself wit! more propriety, and to render assistance to their fellow-citizens in this neighbourhood, and in parts more remote, that they in their turn may extend useful knowledge still farther from town to village, and from village to town, until the whole nation be sufficiently enlightened and united in the same cause, which cannot fail of being the case, wherever the most excellent works of Mr. Thomas Paine find residence. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 141 Those works are the works which hava held an hereditary monarchy, however limited, to be inconsistent with the rights of man; which have held the constitution of parliament in this country to be inconsistent with the rights of man; and those works, upon the principles of that inconsistency, have held even the parliament itself incompetent to reform any abuses in government. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 142 The paper they transmit states as a fact, that the number of members at Shefficld were, in March 1792, two thousand. -That the Constitutional Society in London and the Constitutional Society at Sheffield, thus numerous, should have had no connexion by affiliation till the 14th of March, 1792, though, on that 14th of March, 1792, it appears that the Sheffield Society had had correspondence, and had become connected with the London Corresponding Society, prior to the London Corresponding Sucicty sendin the paper I before stated to the Constitutional Society, is somewhat remarkable. The paper proceeds thus: “ This society, om are chiefly of the manufacturers of s 1d, began about four months ago, and is already increased to nearly two thousand members. In this letter, dated March 14, 1792, they state it to have amounted to two thousand, exclusive of neighhouring towns and villages, who were forming themselves into similar societies. They then state the principles upon which the societies are formed, and that “ they have derived more true knowledge from the two works of Mr. Themas Paine, intituled Rights of Man, Part the First and Second, than from any other author on the subject. The tice as well as the principle of government is laid down in those works, in a mannet so clear and irresistibly convincing, that this society do hereby resolve to give their thanks to Mr. Paine for his two said publications intituled Rights of Man. Gentlemen, I beg your pardon for addressing you so much at length on this case, but I feel it my bounden duty to the public, to you, and to the prisoner at the bar, to warn you fully of the whole of it. There is nothing which, I am sure, would more certainly happen, than that I should go, not only out of this court, but to my grave, with pain, if I should have stated to you in a proceeding of this nature the doctrines of Mr. Paine, otherwise than as I think of them. If that is meant to be intimated, that we may have no dispute about them, and that we may not misunderstand what is that principle, and that practice, to which the passage I have now read alludes, you will allow me to read a few passages out of this second part of the Rights of Man, said to contain both the principleiand practice of government, and then I ask you what those must have intended, with respect to the government of this country, who meant to take any step in order to make a change in it, in such a way as the principle and practice laid down in that book would require them to make it, recollecting that the government of this country is a government consisting in a king, having an hereditary crown, together with Lords and Commons, forming a parliament according to the laws and constitution of England. Now, that author, in the first place, expresses a great deal of what possibly may be differently thought of by other persons, but what I cannot call good-will to the people of England—for he says, “ that during the time of the American war, he was strongly impressed with the idea, that if he could cet over to England without being known, and only remain in safety till he could out 8 publication, that he could open the eyes of the country with respect to the madness and stupidity of its government. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 143 Let us see in what that madness consisted according to him: having stated in his former book that a government ought to exist in no country, but according to the principles of the rights of man—he re again the distinction he had stated in his former book, between what he calls the two systems: he says, ‘“ that the one now called the okd is hereditary, either in whole or in part, which is that of England; and the new is entirely repregentative,—that is,.a government consisting of a Commons House, if you choose so to call it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 145 “ Hereditary successionis a burlesque upon monarchy. It puts it in the most ndiculous light by presenting it as an office, which any child or idiot may fill. It requires some talents to be a olan Lise i to be a king requires only the animal figure of man, i ant of ireatlinns autumaton. This sort of superstition may last a few years more, but it cannot long resist the awakened reason and interest of man ; then, “ in whatever manner the separate parts of a constitution may be arranged, there is one general principle, that distinguishes freedom from slavery, which is, that all hereditary government over a people is to them a species of slavery, and representative government is freedom ; then, speaking of the crown of England, that crown, in which, according to the law and constitution of this country, aecording to its principle and practice, is vested the sovereignty in the manner in which I have stated it, he says, “ having thus glanced at some of the defects of the two Houses of Parliament, I procced to what is called the crown, upon which I shall be very concise. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 146 “It signifies a nominal office of a million sterling a year
ATTORNEYGENERAL 148 Gentlemen, in another part of this work, you will find that Mr. Paine was very well aware of what these Sheftield correspondents were aware of, if they were the composers of the letter to which I have alluded; that the rinciples, laid down in the constitution ofrance, which these two books were to re-commend, and the principles, stated in: Paioe’s first book, were absolutely inconsistent with the constitution itself of France, as it existed at that moment; and Paine propheti-cally (he would not have had common sense if he had stated it otherwise), even in thebeginning of 1792, when he publishes this ; book, foretells that the government of France, with a king a part of it, upon his principles, ; and the ‘principles professed by the constitution of France, could not exist: he foresawshat in August 1792; and I will prove, that persons, who were thus approving the rinciples and practice of Paine, new that a ing could not exist consistently with those ; principles ; and they adopted them therefore, ; as we insist, in order that a king should not -exist in this country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 149 Gentlemen, these resolutions being received perhaps from Sheffield, a step is taken upon them in the Constitutional Society, and & step, which gives an authenticity to the. book I have in my hand, namely, the book of ; their proceedings, whichis remarkable enough; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 150 for in this society’s book there are these resofutions, which are supposed to be received from Sheffield, watered to the book ; and then with a view of 2 publication of them, in the ong Chronicle, World, Post, Times, Argus, English Chronicle, and General Evening Post, for the purpose of cireulating the principles of Mr. Thomas Paine, and for the purpose of circulating the representation, which is made in these resolutions, there is first of all, in Mr. Tooke’s hand-writing,— “ Society for Constitutional Information, London, March 23rd, 1792. This Society having weceived the following and other communications from Sheffield, vi2
ATTORNEYGENERAL 152 “ Resolved, that this society will on Friday next, March 31st, ballot for the twelve associated members recommended by the Sheffield committee, and approved at this meeting
ATTORNEYGENERAL 154 Gentlemen, this society, having in this letter expressed an inclination that they should have some associated members in the Constitutional Society, that affiliation begins in the Constitutional Socicty in London, which I have alluded to; and accordingly you will find, that upon the 31st of March, twelve persons were ballotted for as from the Sheffield Society, and became associated members of this society; you observe, that this letter had stated from Sheffield that they had received before a communication from Mr. Tooke, and Mr. Tooke afterwards writes a draught of a letter which is sent to them, in which he states, “I am directed by the Society for Constitutional Information to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, and to express to you that very great pleasure and satistaction which they received from your communication; the society have unanimously elected twelve (here follow the names of the persons), “ as associated msmbers of this society.’—These persons being certainly, gentlemen, extremely respectable men as subjects of Great Britain, but at the Same time men, that one wonders a little should, upon such a purpose as this, without a little more instruction being infused into their minds, have been associated as members into this society—“ and we flatter ourselves, that when any business or other occasion shall lead any of those gentlemen to London, they will be kind enough to honour the society by their presence, and give us an opportunity of cementing that friendship between us, which all the zealous friends of public freedom and the happiness of mankind ought to feel and exercise towards each other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 155 “P.S. I am desired, by Mr. Horne Tooke, to request each of the associated members to honour him by the acceptance of the books which accompany this letter ;—which were, I apprehend it appears, so many parts of the Rights of Man. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 156 Gentlemen, upon the 24th of March 1792, a paper apeears to have been sent to the Constitutional Society from a nest of societies, the United Constitutional Societies at Norwich: this was the 24th of March 1792, and it appears, as I am instructed, that the words “24th March 1792, are also in the handwriting of Mr. Tooke. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 157 “At a meeting of the delegates of the United Constitutional Societies, held the 24th March 1799, at the Wheel-of Fortune, St. Edmund's in the city of Norwich, it was unanimously agreed to communicate to the gentlemen of the London Society for ConstiPa Information, the following Resoluions: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 158 “ 1st. We are happy to see the success of the Sheffield Society for Constitutional Reform, and approve of the delegations, which you and they have made in order to form a plan of general information. We humbly eg that you would grant to us the same favour ; and it is our wish, that all the Societies of a similar kind in England were only as so many members strongly and indissolubly united in one political body. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 159 “Secondly. We believe that instructing the people in political knowledge, and in their only effectual way to oblain the grand object of reform, for men need only be made acquainted with the abuses of government, and natural and inherent rights as men, is the they will readily jom in every lawfat means to obtain redress; we havethe pleasure to inform you that our societies consist of some hun dreds, and new societies are frequently forming, which, by delegates, preserve a mutual intercourse with each other, for mutual instruction and information; and the greatest care has been taken to preserve order and regularity at our meetings, to convince the world that riot and disorder are no parts of our political creed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 160 “ 8dly. We believe, and are firmly oe suaded (and if any man thought so, he had a right to say so if he pleased), “that Mr. Burke, the once friend of liberty, has traduced the greatest and most glorious revolution ever recorded in the annals of history; we thank Mr. Burke for the political discussion provoked and by which he has opened unto us the dawn of a glorious day. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 161 “ 4thly. To Mr. Thomas Paine our thanks are especially due for the First and Second parts of the Rights of Man, and we sincerely wish that he may live to see his labours— that is, the destruction of hereditary government and limited monarchy, and consequeath the government of England—“ crowned wi success in the general diffusion of liberty and happiness among mankind. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 162 Gentlemen this letter does not appear (though the words, the 24th of Mareh, are in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke) to have been read in the Constitutional Society till the 14th of May 1792, when they read this letter, and also another, which I will now state to you, from the society called the Norwich Revolution Seciety. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 163 “ The Norwich Revolution Society wishes to opena communication with you atthis time, when corruption has acquired a publicity in the senate, which exacts from the honour the British nation renewed exertions for parliament reform—without prejudging the probable event—(this is a material passage. when you connect it with what is found in other subsequent papers) —“ even of such an application to the legislature, the soeicly is willing to circulate the information, and to co-operate in the measures, that may seem best adapted to further so desirable and so important an end; it is willing to hope the redress of every existing grievance at the hands of a government resulting from an extraordinary convocation in 1688—an extraordinary convention of all, who had at any preceding time been elected representatives of the people, assisted by the hereditary counsellors of the nation, and a peculiar deputation from the metropolis; which - national constituting assembly cashiered for miisconduct a king of the house vf Stuart. — 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 164 The opinions und principles of this society are best explained by an appeal to their literary representative— o James Mackintosh, author of the Vindiclz Gallice, the society affers the tribute of its approbation-and gratitude for the knowledge, the eloquence, and the philosophical spirit, with which he has explained, defended, and commented on the revolution of France; it hesitates to assent to this only of his opinions—that there are but two interests in society, those of the rich and those of the poor—if so, what chance have the latter? Surely the interests of all the industrious, from the richest merchant to the poorest mechanic, are, in every community the same, to lessen the numbers of the unproductive, to whose maintenance they contribute, and to do away such institutions and imas abridge the means of maintenance, y resisting the demand for labour, or by sharing in reward : as the means most conducive to this comprehensive end, the Norwich Revolution Society desires an equitable representation of the people. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 165 “ The Rights of Man by Thomas Paine, and the advice to the privileged orders by Joel Barlow, a book which I shall give in evidence, and therefore shall state some passages from presently, “have also been read with attention and circulated with avidity
ATTORNEYGENERAL 167 Barlow’s book you will find is, in the plainest and most unequivocal language, as I understand it, an exhortation to all people to get rid of kingly government, and addressed more Particularly to the two societies I have mentioned, as containing the substance of the buSiness, in which they are interested, as you will see when I come to state the transactions of October 1792. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 168 he Rights of Man by Thomas Paine, and the advice to the privileged orders by Joel Barlow, have also been read with attention and circulated with avidity; they point out with clearness most of the abuses which have accumulated under the British government ; they attack with energy most of the prejudices which have tended to perpetuate them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 169 Now, how any man living could thank these People without informing them that, if they really meant well to their country, they must be ignorant in the extreme, or something worse, if they could reconcile cither the Rights of Man or Joel Barlow’s book on the Privileged Orders with the principles of that convention in 1688, which is the foundation of the liberties of this country, is to me quite inexplicable. But, after stating the constitution of this country, in a letter fabricated with great art, there follow the twelve names of the intended associated members from Norwich; and the description of some of these twelve happens also, from a singular circumstance, to be in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke. Then this society returns thanks to the societies at Sheffield and Norwich for these communications. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 170 The resolutions of the London Corresponding Society, which I told you were sent on the 30th of March, are to this effect : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 171 “ Resolved, That every individual has aright to share in the government of that society of which he is a member, unless incapacitated. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 172 “ Resolved, That nothing but non-age, or privation of reason, or an offence against the general rules of society, can incapacitate him. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 173 “ Resolved, That it is not less the right, than the duty of every citizen, to keep a watchful eye on the government of this country, that the laws, by being multiplied, do not degenerate into oppression, and that those who are intrusted with the government do not substitute private interest for public advantuge. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 174 “ Resolved, That the people of Great Lritain are not properly represented in pariiament, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 175 “ Resolved, That in consequence of a partial, unequal, and inadequate representation, together with the corrupt method in which representatives are elected, oppressive taxes, unjust laws, restrictions of liberty, and wasting of the public money, have ensued. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 176 “ Resolved, That the only remedy to those evils is, a fair and impartial representation of the people in parliament. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 177 “ Resolved, That a fair and impartial representation can never take place until partial privileges are abolished, and the strong temptations held out to electors afford a presumptive proof, that the representatives of this country seldom procure a seat in parliament from the unbought suffrages ofa free people. Resolved, That this society do express their abhorrence of tumult and violence : and that, as they aim at reform not anarchy, reason, firmness, and unanimity be the only arms they employ, or persuade their fellowcitizens to exert against abuse of power. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 178 Gentlemen, in this, which I have now read to you, I am willing, if you please, that you should construe every word of it, though certainly it is pot consistent with the principles of British government, upon this principle, that those, who sent that paper to the Constitutional Society, if it even was sent there at all, really understood it to be consistent with the principles of the British government; and I claim no credit for the veracity with which Lassert, that this conspiracy has existed, unless I show you by subsequent acts of this society, that at this moment they meant what Mr. Paine says, in principle and practice, is the only rational thing—a representative government ; the direct contrary of the government which is established here. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 179 You will find, by what I shall lay before you, that there was a society in Southwark. —To this society the London Corresponding Society, in a letter which I have to read to you presently, stated their adoption of all Mr. Paine’s principles, with a view, as I think, to the practice recommended in his works: this society also received the thanks of the Constitutional Society fora communication which I am about to state to you; and the London Corresponding Society afterwards entered, as it seems to me, into-a combination with them, upon the principles stated in that communication: I say it is impossible, attending toConstitutional Society—“ and with the Socithese facts, for any man who reasons fairly, ety for Constitutional Information in London, to doubt that the principle of the London ! as the best means of cementing the common 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 180 Corresponding Suciety and of the Constitutio-nal Society was, to furm a representatice go- ; vernment, in this country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 181 A declaration from a society in Southwarkwas read: Resolved, that the thanks ofthis society be given to the Southwark societyfor the following communication, and that it be published in the newspapers : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 182 “ April 19, 1792, at the Three Tuns tavern,Southwark — Resolved, That we do now form ourselves into a society for the diffusion ofpolitical knowledge. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 183 “ Resulved, That the society be denomi- nated the Friends of the People. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 184 “ Resolved, That the following be the declaration of this suciety,"—which is the preamble to the constitution in France, in the year 171 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 185 “ Considering that ignorance, forgetfulness, or conten:pt of the rights of men, are the sole causes of public grievances, and the corruption of government, this society, formed for the purpose of investigating and asserting thoserights, and of uniting our efforts with others : of our fellow-citizens for correcting national abuses, and restraining unnecessary and exorbitant taxation, do hereby declare— 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 186 “First, That the great end of civil society is general happiness. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 187 Secondly, fhat no form of government is good, any farther than it secures that object. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 188 “ Thirdly, That all civiland political autho-rity is derived from the pecple—that people, of whom they were afterwards to form a convention. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 189 “ Fourthly, That equal active citizenship is the unalienable right of all men; minors, criminals, and insane persons excepted. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 190 Now will my friend dispute with me what these principles, according to the ideas of those who state them, lead to? “ Fifthly, That the exercise of that right, in appointing an adequate representative government,—that is, the government, which Mr. Paine tells you, rejects every thing that is hereditary—is what; “ the wisest device of human policy—not only that, but it is— “ the only security of national freedom
ATTORNEYGENERAL 192 The Sone for Constitutional Information return their thanks upon that also, and then those persons who write this letter say farther in the same paper— 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 193 “We call upon our fellow-citizens, of all descriptions, to institute societies for the same great purpose—that is the purpose of introducing representative government— and we recommend a general correspondence with each other—but attached and rivetted to the union, and of directing with greater ener, our united efforts to the same common ol jects. ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 194 What were the objects of this society ? You will find that the objects of this society were the objects of the Constitutional Society ; and you will find presently that they were the objects of the Corresponding Society : The Constitutional Society resolved, that every society, desiring an union, or correspondence with this, and which doth not profess any principles destructive to truth or justice —how this gives occasion for the first remark T have to make upon language—“ or subversive to the liberties of our country: but which, on the contrary, secks, as we do, the removal of corruption from the legislature and abuses from the government, ought to be, and we hope will be embraced with the most brotherly affection and patriotic friendship by this society. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 195 1 observe upon this, that all this handsome language is perfectly consistent with this principle, in the minds of those who write it, and they do not venture to explain it, because I think they durst not explain it,—with this idea in their minds, that those principles were destructive of truth aud justice were subversive to the liberties of the country, which were principles in opposition to those of Mr. Paine; and that all practice, that was in opposition to the practice he recommends, was subversive to the liberties of the country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 196 I come now to a circumstance or two, which lead me to state shortly what will be proved to be the original constitution of the London Corresponding Seciety—the plan (the efficacy of which had been tried in France, and which men, who came from that country, were probably well acquainted with)—was, to unite, first small bodies of men—as svon as they came to a greater number, to divide them into smaller parties, and so to spread themselves by degrees (as you will find in the letters, was the purpose of these societies), from town to town, from village to village, from hamlet to hamlet, till, as they explain it, there should not be an unenlightened man in the country. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 197 The constitution of the London Corresponding Society was formed upon this principle ; it will appear from the written evidence which will be produced to you, that a gentle. man of the name, I think of Felix Vaughan, was appointed a delegate upon the 30th of April, for No. 63; that Mr. Hardy cousulted him; and, being also appointed to form a constitutional code of Jaws for the Londom Corresponding Society, Mr. Hardy consulted him upon that subject. The preamble te the resolutions which formed their constitution was this: “ Whereas it is notorious that very numerous butthensomeand unnecessary taxes are laid on the persons and families of us and others the industrious inhabitants of Greatfor No. 68; Mr. Richter, a pai 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 198 Britain, an exeeedingly great majority of whom are, notwithstanding, excluded from all representation in parliament; and as apon inquiry into the cause of this grievance, which 13 at once an obstruction to our industry, and a diminution of our property, we find that the constitution of our country, which was purchased for us at the expense of the lives of our ancestors, has by the violence and intrigue of criminal and designing men, been injured aad undermined in its most essential and impettant parts, but particularly in the House of Commons, where the whole of the supposed representation of the people is neither more nor less than an usurped power—I hope, gentlemen, it cannot be required that I should contend against such an assertion in this lace, if a court of law in this country has not ost all the character that belongs to law ; how that usurped power was ever to be employed as an organ in the constitution of that new representative body that this society atmed at, consistent with their own principles, remains to this moment unintelligible to me— ‘arising either from abuses in the mede of election and duration of parliaments, or from a corrupt property in certain decayed corporations, by means of which the liberties of this nation are basely bartered away from the bribed profit of the members of parliament: and as it farther appears to ws, that until this source of corruption shall he cleansed by the determination, perseverance, firmness, and union of the people at large, we are robbed of the inheritance so acquired for us by our forefathers, and that our taxes, instead of being lessened, will go on increasing, as they will furnish more bribes, places, and pensions, to ministers and members of parliament: we therefore, having resolved to unite ourselves into one firm and permanent body, for the purpose of informing ourselves and others of the exact state of the present parliamentary Tepresentation, for obtaining a peaceful but adequate remedy to this intolerable grievance, and for corresponding and co-operating with other societies, united for the same objects, have unanimously adopted the following regulations for the internal order and government of our society. They then state their regulations ; and their constitution having been thus formed, they publish it afterwards in the month of May. What observations they state to the public upon it in the month of May I shall have occasion to represent presently ; you will see the manner of proceeding with respect to the election of their delegates, by the production of a particular paper. On the 13th of April, a person, whom you have heard much of Mr. Margarot, is appointed a delegate; upon the 30th of April, Mr. Vaughan was, as tar as the paPer is evidence of the fact, appointed delegate for Number 65; Mr. Richter, a party named in this indictment, and Mr, a another party, inst whom the grand jury have found abil, but who is not caandiea this indictment, are also appointed delegates. Mr. Hardy is not only secretary, but he is appointed, upon the 13th of April a delegate ; and there is a choice of delegates for the whole of these bodies. You will find they afterwards met from time to time, to pursue the great purposes of their incor, tion, at an alehouse, I think, the Bell in Exeter street, in the Strand, from which place some of the correspondence I am abontto state to you comes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 199 Gentlemen, the Society for Constitutional Information, having afhliated several societies very suddenly with themselves—whether Mr. Paine remained in this country or not I cannot tell—they felt an inclination to affiliate with another society, which is to be, as it appears to me, in justice to them, very strongly distinguished indeed with respect to the principles upon which they acted, I mean the socicty calling itself the Friends of the People, meeting at Free Masons’ Tavern: with what prudence or discretion that society formed itself is a subject which I shall not discuss, but it is a most important fact, that in the first attempt, which the Society for Constitutional Information made (and it ought to be known in justice to the Friends of the People), the first attempt they made to affiliate themselves with the Society of tha Friends of. the People, that society, in correspondence that will be read to you, acts as some individual members of tlie Constitutional Society had done ; they say —“ No, we discover your design from what you are doing; you tell us, from your approbation of resolutions entered into at Manchester, signed by Mr. Walker and Mr. Jackson, that you approve the sort of schemes Mr. Paine has set forth; that you approve projects of giving, im loose and indefinite terms, the full extent a what you a the rights of the ple, to the people: that is Ai see intent ae think,—and, gentiemen, many a man may very honestly thinic it, but he must go about the execution of his thoughts in a leyal way, if he does so think, if he means to reduce his thoughts into praetice—“ we think that parliament is not adequate to all the ends for which it is instituted as a body, through which is to be spoken, as far as the constitution requires, the will of the people; but we do not mean what you mean; we mean to preserve the forms of the constitution, which itis clear you do not; we mean, says lord John Russell, in a letter, which will be read, “ to preserve the forms of the constitution, and therefore must decline all correspondence with you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 200 Gentlemen, it happens—it belongs to secieties of this nature, and I desire to he understood, therefore, in stating it, only es stating a circumstance, which in its nature does belong to those societies, and which will happen—that it was thought necessary, forthe great purpose of doing that which was eventually to be done, that a society, which had rejected co-operation with the Society for Constitutional Information, should still be kept, for the purposes of the Society for Constitutional Information, in fact and effect corresponding and connected with it. Accordingly Pi will find that this Suciety of the Friends of the People, rejecting upon principle the plan which they thought abandoned the forms of the constitution, that this society retained, in its own bosom, according to the account J have of it, many members, who happened to belong to the other society, and the work of both societies went on by the same instruments: they were thus therefore connected in fact, though they did not choose as a body to have one society in connexion with the other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 201 Gentlemen, having stated that, you will allow me now to mention, though it is a little out of date, but it also connects itself with and illustrates the last observations I made, that the society at Sheffield, which had connected itself by affiliation with the Society for Constitutional Information, and you will also find with the London Corresponding Society, had received, about the 24th of May, intelli-ae from the Society of the Friends of the eople, which stated to them very correctly what their objects were, the means by which they meant to accomplish them, and the attention which they meant to pay to the forms of the constitution. Youwill now see what the Society for Constitutional Information understood to be the objects of the Sheffield Society, and what the Sheffield Society understood to be the objects of the Society for Constitutional Information. The Sheffield Society (though I do not know that they kept their word) distinctly disavowed, in a letter of the 26th May, to the ConstitutionalSociety, having any thing more to do with that socleyy called: the Friends of the People —which meant to preserve the forms of the constitution ; represented that they had totally misunderstood them, and would have nothing more to do with them, but to the extent, to which the Society for Constitutional Information permitted. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 202 You will find in a letter from Sheffield, of the 26th of May, and this corrected by Mr. Tooke, that they thank the Constitutional Society for accepting their members. They then state that they had increased to two thousand four hundred
ATTORNEYGENERAL 204 “ Previous to the reception of this packet, we did communicate to them by letter the pleasing hopes it reflected on us on looking forward, viewing such respectable characters signalizing themselves in support of the people’s rights, agreeable to the above principe and the denomination by which they ave entitled themselves, &c. In due course they would receive our letter last Thursday seven-night; and in consequence, we apprehend the packet was forwarded to us on the same day, but without any written communication. We shall not attempt any further communication with them, until we are favoured with your sentiments upon the subject, or until matters of doubt which are at present entertained be removed. Then there 1s a note, which shows the necessity of this fostering care of the Constitutional Society: they say— Birmingham in particular claims all the assistance from established societies, which possibly can be administered. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 205 Having written to the Constitutional Society upon the 26th of May, they find it expedient, for the same purpose, to trouble their correspondents of the London Corresponding Society ; “We were favoured with your very affectionate letter of the 7th ultimo, and communication, in due course; and I am directed by this society to inform you, that it is with infinite satisfaction they receive the information, that your firm and laudable endeavours are directed to that effectual and necessary purpose, of opening and enlightening the ublic mind, and disseminating useful knowedge amongst the general mass of the people : by an orderly proceeding in a firm pursuit of truth and equity, there cannot be a doubt but that our joint endeavours will in due time be crowned with success. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 206 “ As brothers and fellow-labourers we congratulate you on the rapid progrees of useful and real knowledge in the various parts of this nation, which sufficiently indicates that the time cannot be far distant when truth will be more predominant, equity more gererally administered, and sound wisdom more universally sought after. When pride, ambition, and ignorance give place to these virtues, when oppression ceases and charity abounds, when men in principle and practice verify the necessity and advantage of doing to others as they wish to be done by; then, and not till Noe can any people or nation be said to be 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 207 We have herewith enclosed our rules, &c. Should have written you much sooner, but on account of a diappointment in the printing of our articles, &c. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 208 “Our numbers continue to increase, both here, and in the adjacent towns and villages ; a general coucurrence prevails, as to the necessity of the business, and the measures adopted by this society for obtaining our object. It will be of great importance to the cause we are engaged in, that a more frequent communication be maintained amongst: all the similar institutions; for which reason we beg the favour of your correspondence at every convenient specrtaplyy which will be highly obliging to this society, who in return pledge themselves to observe the same rule. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 209 Gentlemen, having stated to you now what it was that the Society of the Friends of the People discovered to be the object of the Constitutional Society, and I agreeing with them in thinking their discovery upon that subject was accurate and right, you will find it necessary to go back, and to proceed in the order of time to the 7th of April. Mr. Hardy sent from the London Corresponding Society a copy of their resolutions to the Society for Constitutional Information, which was established at Manchester, and desired also to have correspondence with them, as they were engaged in one common cause; that Manchester Society, you will recollect, which hoped that the other great benefits which Mr. Paine had stated, would be carried into effect. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 210 He says, “ We began this society about ten weeks ago; it is composed chiefly of tradesmen and shopkeepers. The enclosed will inform you of the principles we set out upon. —When we first associated, we flattered ourselves that no other societies in the nation were formed upon the same principles—butin two or three weeks afterwards we were most agreeably informed of our brethrenat Sheffield having taken the lead in so glorious a cause —we immediately wrote to them, and were answered without delay, expressing a wish to unite with us, for promoting the ends we have in view, and we are assured of success, by persevering prudently, and with unanimity. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 211 Upon the 18th of April 1799, in furtherance of this plan, you will find Mr. Hardy writes a letter to the president of the society in the Borough—Now that is the society, the principles of which I have so distinctly stated before, as leading to representative government, as the only security for liberty in the country. —It appears that their declarations had also been sent to the London Corresponding 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 212 Society; and Mr. Hardy, upon the 18th of April 1792, says “ I am ordered by the London Corresponding Society, to send a copy of their resolutions to the society that meets at the Three Tuns tavern, in the Borough, established on purpose for restoring the rights of election, or in other words, to obtain aug equal representation of the people of this nation in parliament. ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 213 Now they had avowed, and avowed in their declaration, that their object of a representation of the people in parliament was precisely that more extended one in its principle, which obtained at the timeof the Commonwealth in England—namely, a representation of the people in parliament, termed a parliament, but without King oF Lords, a representative government—“ We should: be very happy to enter into a correspondence with your society—as we are all engaged in the same grand and important cause, there is an absolute necessity for us to unite together, and communicate with each other, that our sentiments and determinations may centre in one point, viz. to have the rights of man re-established, especially in this nation; but our views of the rights of man are not confined solely to this small island, but are extended to the whole human race— black or white, high or low, rich or poor. I give you the following as my own opinion— perhaps you may think it a singular sentiment—and then an opinion is given, which it is my duty to state, though I do not understand it—“ that the king and the nobles, as much as the peasant and ignoble, are equally deprived of their rights
ATTORNEYGENERAL 215 Gentlemen, there is an answer to this, from a person of the name, I think, of Favell, who is chairman of the Friends of the People in Southwark: he says—“ I duly received your letter, containing the resolutions of the London Corresponding Society—which I have communicated tu our society in the borough— andI am directed to return them the thanks of that society, and to assure them they shall cordially unite with them, and all similar societies throughout the kingdom, in endeavouring to effect those great objects for which they are associated—namely, to engage the attention of their fellow-citizens to examine the general abuses of government, and to exercise their deliberative wisdom in a calm but intrepid manner in applying those remedies
ATTORNEYGENERAL 217 A letter aud resolutions from the Revolution and Constitutional Societies at Norwich, dated 26th of April 1792, were read at themeeting of the society for Constitutional In- : formation, on the 4th of May following: they distinctly state—that Mr. Paine’s books were to be the medium, through which the preju- ; dices that had grown up under the British ernment were to be get rid of, and the ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 218 Constitutional Society return them theirthanksjn these words—“ This society receives the above communication with the most heartfelt satisfaction, and desires earnestly to concur and co-operate with those societies in their 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 219 Jaudable objects ; that the secretary do inform them of the same, and that this society has unanimously elected the twelve members of “the Norwich societies to be associated memders of this society. ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 220 Upon the 11th of May 1792, the Constitutional Society resolved, that there should be a communication from that society with the society of the Friends of the Constitution at Paris, known by the name of Jacobins: they send an address to them, which is in thesewords—“ Brothers and fellow-citizens of the world— 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 221 he cordial and affectionate reception with which you have honoured our worthy countrymen, Mr. Thomas Cooper, and Mr. James Watt, members of the society of Manchester, and united with our society, has been communicated to us by the correspondence of those gentlemen. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 222 ‘In offering you our congratulations on the glorious revolution which your nation has accomplished, we speak a language which only sincerity can dictate. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 223 “ The formality of courts affords no example tous: to do our thoughts justice, we give to the heart the liberty it delights in, and hail you as brothers. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 224 “It is not among the least of the revolutions which time is unfolding to an astonished world, that two nations, nursed by some wretched craft in reciprocal hatred, should so suddenly break their common odious chain, and rush into amity. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 225 “ The principle that can produce such an effect is the offspring of no earthly court; and whilst it exhibits to us the expensive iniquity of former politics, it enables us with bold feli‘eity to say we have done with them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 226 “ In contemplating the political condition of nations, we cannot conceive a more diabolical system of government than that which has been generally practised over the world, to feed the avarice, and gratify the wickedness of ambition ; the fraternity of the human race has been destroyed, as if the several nations of the earth had been created by rival gods— 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 227 “man has not considered man as the work of one creator. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 228  The political institutions, under which he has lived, have been counter to whatever religion he professed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 229 “Instead of that universal benevolence, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 230 -which the morality of every known religion declares, he bas been politically bred to consider his species as his natural enemy, and to describe virtues and vices by a geugraphical chart. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 231 he principles we now declare are not peculiar to the society that addresses you; they are extending themselves with accumulatin force through every part of our country, an derive strength from an union of causes, which no other principles admit. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 232 he religious friend of man, of every denomination, records them as his own ; they animate the lover of rational liberty, and they cherish the heart of the poor, now bending unae a oppression of taxes, by a prospect of relief, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 233 “We have against us only that same enemy, which is the enemy of justice in all countries, a herd of courtiers fattening on the spoil of the public. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 234 It would have given an additional triumph to our congratulations, if the equal rights of man, which are the foundation of your declaration of rights, had been recognised by the governments around you, and tranquillit established in all; but, if despotisms be still reserved to exhibit, by conspiracy and combination, a further example of infamy to future ages, that power that disposes of events, best knows the means of making that example finally beneficial to his creatures. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 235 “ We have beheld your peaceable principles insulted by despotic ignorance ; we have seen the right hand of fellowship, which you hold out to the world, rejected i those who riot on its plunder; we now behold you a nation provoked into defence, and we can see no mode of defence equal to that of establishing the general freedom of Europe. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 236 “ln this best of causes we wish you success; our hearts go with you; andin saying this we believe we utter the voice of millions. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 237 Gentlemen, this address was signed by the chairman of the Constitutional Society, and transmitted to Mr. Watt, at Paris; and, upon the 28th of May 1792, was ordered to be published. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 238 After this, the principles of Mr. Paine, which, you observe, contain the doctrines that TI have been stating to you, were carried farther in a third book (I’ mean in that book called the Address to the Addressers, which I shail also be able to give in evidence to you) : Mr. Paine having there gone the length of asserting the folly, absurdity, and wickedness of the government, under which we live—not only of asserting the incompeteney of government, as it is constituted, to change itself, but having asserted that a conventionary representation of the people, in that sense in which we speak of it, must do this work, he proceeds to the extent of stating the plan and form of an organization of that sort, upon which the convention was to be framed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 239 Gentlemen, it was impossible not toapply to the justice of the law, against the attack made upon our government by the person who went to the extent I am now stating, with the approbation, published over and over again, of these societies, who, in their corporate character, if I may so speak, could not be prosecuted for doing 1t—it became necessary to ask a juty of this country, whether these doctrines were to be tolerated—what is “the consequence of that? [t is, that these societies immediately enter into subscriptions for the support of Mr. Paine, and they consider themselves as engaged in propagating his works in that way, in which no work ever was propagated —to the intent to produce that convention, without which the nation, in no organization of its government, could be said, according to them, to exist in a state of freedom as a nation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 240 Gentlemen, you will not be surprised, if it also appears that, in going on progressively to the execution of the mischief that was intended, they became more mischievous; and you will find members parting from the seciety, expressly telling them, that they meant to destroy the government of the country ; that they cannot, therefore, stay among them ; and to which members, as far as appears from any information that I have had, they did not condescend to explain themselves—to say, No, you have mistaken our object—this is not what we mean; but they leave them unanswered, and go on to execute the purposes they were about. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 241 Having come to those resolutions in order to support Mr. Paine in these prosecutions, they publish the resolutions, they publish the books of Mr..Paine, they publish these resolutions in the various newspapers (the editors of these newspapers insuring, if I may so say, themselves against the hazards of the law, some tor more, some for less, and theyrisk the hazard of 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 242 Propagating the doctrines, provided the consideration paid is ample enough, as a premium for the risk), and then these publications are sent down to the country to various places, in hundreds, and thousands—I am sorry to say, to persons of all professions, to distribute—I am Sorry to say, to some of the most sacred professions, whose numes will appear to you when they come to be read—and this mode of propaaling these doctrines is adapted to the utter mpossibility of detection, and for the very piece of having that effect—to make the aw of the country unequal to the mischief, which it was to meet. Atthis time a proclamation was issued hy the executive government of the country, in order to restrain these publications; and both the societies, you will find, cloaking theimselves under the words “a full and fair representation of the people, which words they have never condescended to explain, which words never do exist in any text of any writing of theirs, as I can find, with the mention ofa king, or other house of legislature : they should spread the effect of the mischief more widely and diffusely than otherwise they could have done. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 243 Upon the 24th of May 1792, there isa letter sent from Mr. Hardy, I believe not in his own hand-writing, but I believe in the handwriting of Mr. Vaughan, whomIbefore named to you, in which he states, that, by the direction of the London Correspunding Society, he had the honour of enclosing to them a copy of their address and regulations, which he requests they will communicate to: the Constitutional Society. The thanks of the society were given to them for this; and that is a publication more guarded than anothet you will find published upon the 6th of Aus gust 1792, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 244 After stating their constitution, which I bes fore mentioned to you, it says— But, as Pros vidence has furnished men in every statioa with faculties necessary fur judging of what concerns themselves, shall we, the multitude, suffer a few, with no better right than ourselves, to usurp the power of governing us without control? Surely not: let us rathef unite in one common cause to cast away our bondage, being assured, that in so doing we are protected by a jury of our countrymen, while we are discharging a duty to ourselves, to our country, and to mankind. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 245 Gentlemen, you will find from a paper of the 6th of August, that that, which they supposed was to meet with protection from a jury of the country, was a ccmbination to re form the government of the country by means—other than application to parliament —which binds together, with the king, as the great political body of the country, the whole system under which we live. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 246 Gentlemen, the London Corresponding Sos ciety, as to the king’s proclamation, followed the example of the Canatitunonal Society, and, on the 3tst of May, 1792, in a paper that will be read to you, they vilify the proclamation ; and this paper having been communicated by the London Corresponding Society to the Constitutional Society — they, aware of the nature of it, order, that that paper should be published in such newspapers as will receive the advertisements of this socicty
ATTORNEYGENERAL 248 You will find a letter, dated the 14th of June, 1792, trom certain persons styling themselves the Editors of the Patriot (whe they are Iam not able to state to you, but who, for the purposes of these societies, thought it necessary to conceal their names), in which they desire the Corresponding Society to take am opportunity of enlightening the public mind by publications, by advertisements, by circulating those papers in villages to country farmers, desiring, as I 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 249 vilify the proclamation, and they make tiestated, to conceal their name, but requesting very means the executive government took tothat the papers might be sent-to a person, suppress the mischief a mean by which theywhy holds an important situation in a subseent part of this business—a Mr. Gale, a kseller at Sheffield. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 250 Gentlemen, there will be laid before you various parts of the proceedings of the Constitutional Society, which relate to Mr. Paine, which I shall now pass over, except for the purpose of calling your attention to another publication of his upon the sixth of June, 1792, and which was addressed to Mr. Dundas; you will likewise find that that book, which will be given you in evidence, distinctly disavows all hereditary government; all monarchy, under whatever qualifications ; and then, for the purpose of circulating this doctrine, as they had before circulated the doctrines in other works of this gentleman, they order, “ that twelve thousand copies of that letter shall be printed for the society, for the purpose of being transmitted to our correspondents throughout Great Britain, and that a committee be appointed to direct the same. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 251 Gentlemen, I pass on now to the 6th of August, 1792; at which time there appears to me to have been an extremely important transaction in the London Corresponding Society; it is the propagation of an address of that date, which first developes, as it seems to me, though in somewhat of covert language, the determination of these societies to work what they call a reform without any communication whatever with that parliament, which they held to be incompetent to bring about the business. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 252 You will find that, upon the &th of August, Mr. Hardy wrote a letter to Mr. Tooke; that he sent him a proof copy of this address; that he hoped it would merit his attention, and his approbation; that he should be exceedingly happy to be favoured with his opinion of it before it was printed. The address, after stating what they considered as the grievances of the country, states this— Such being the forlorn situation of three fourths of the nation, how are Britons to obtain information and redress? Will the Court, will ministry afford either? Will parliament grant them? Will the nobles or the clergy ease the people’s sufferings? No. Experience tells us, and proclamations confirm it, that the interest and intention of power are combined tu keep the nation in torpid ignorance. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 253 ‘ “It then states the only resource to be in these societies; it then states various detailed reasons, which you will hear, and then proceeds to this effect: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 254 “ Numerous other reforms would undoubtedly take place, even in the first session of parliament so elected, dependant only on their electors the peoples untorn therefore by faction, undivided party, uncorrupted by ministry, and uninfluenced but by the public good. Every transaction would tend to reform, aud a strict economy, its natural consequence, might soon enable us to reduce our taxes ; and by the integrity of parliament, that reduction would light upon such objects as best might relieve the poor; this to the people would prove an advantageous and a novel session, and to an honest parliament not a tiresome one. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 255 “ Therefore, Britons, friends, and fellow. citizens, with hand and heart unite, claim what is your right, persevere and be free, for who shall dare withstand our just demands? Oppression, already trembling at the voice of individuals, will shrink away and di for ever, when the nation united shall assert its privileges and demand their restoration. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 256 Gentlemen, the address you will find was circulated with infinite industry to every correspunding society in the kingdom, conveyed through every possible channel, the doctrine adopted by all the affiliating societies; ard the plan, which they went upon from this 6th of Augus& 1792, appears to have been a plan to redress themselves by their own ower, and by their own strength, and not by application to that parliament, which alone can act in legislation: it seems to me to be impossible that you can mistake what is meant by this paper, if you will give your more particular attention to a paper which was received from a society at Stockport, upon the 27th of November, 1792, and found in the possession of Mr. Hardy: this, aftes adverting to those numerous grievances stated in the address of the 6th of August, 1792, is to this effect: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 257 “ In obedience to the wishes ef the soeiety here, I have the pleasure of acknowledging the honour of your letter, and the packet, which the kindness of our brothers of the London Corresponding Society so opportuncly presented us with. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 258 “It is doubly deserving our thanks, as it shows your kindness, and as it will be useful in the formation of our infant society ; we stand much in need of your experience in thig particular, and we doubt not of your best assistance; we are surrounded by a majority, a formidable one indeed in power, abilities, and numbers, but we are not dismayed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 259 “ We have carefully perused the addresses, and I am to observe upon their contents in general, that the sentiments hardly arise to that height which we expert from men sensible to their full claims to absolute and unconrtrolluble liberty, i. e. unaccountable to any power which they have not immediately constituted and appointed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 260 “ These are our sentiments, whatever may be yours; though, in the present state of political knowledge, it may be prudent not to avow them openly. We desire your sentiments on the means of accomplishing that object, which we presume you have in view in common with us; we think it expedient that we should perfectly understand each other in the beginning, lest the appearance of disunion might furnish matter of triumph to our enemies ; we observe one expression,’—you will take notice that Mr. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 261 Hardy at this time was a member both of the London Corresponding and the Constitutional Societies: —“ we observe one expression, which says, ‘ numerous other reforms would take place,’ &c. &c.; but we ask how is that parliament to be chosen? Can we erfet st from the present order of things? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 262 ould not all the evil be done away at once by the people assembling in convention ? Does it appear probable that the odious laws which we complain of, will be abolished any other way? Can the grievances arising from aristocracy be redressed while the retains its present authority in the legislature ? —whether this blank is to be filled up with crown or the House of Lords is for you to judge—“ retains its present authority in the legislature? Is the universal right of conscience ever to be attained while the maintain their seats onthe “ Your thoughts on these important points -we most earnestly desire may be transmitted to us as soon as possible, not directed as the Jast,—and this you will find often occurs ; letters sent under a feigned direction; “ we fear it will excite suspicion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 263 The Stockport Society say of the address of the 6th of August, 1792, sent tothem, that they think it hardly amounts to sentiments such as theirs, namely, that they must have absolute and uncontrollable liberty, unaccountable to any power which they have not immediately constituted—that could not be the king and parliament of Great Britain— they say, ““ We presume you have the same view in common with us, and we desire to have your sentiments upon the means of accomplishing that object. What object? The object of putting themselves in a situation of being unaccountable to any power, which they themselves had not immediately constituted and appointed—how was that to be done 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 265 “ With infinite satisfaction the London Corresponding Society’s committee perused your letter; they are happy to learn your steady determination, in spite of all obstacles, to pursue that sole means of political felicity, a perfect representation of the people. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 266 “ Now, what was the sole means of this political felicity—a perfect representation of the people
ATTORNEYGENERAL 268 ; and an annual parliament,—a body might exist under the term parliament in a commonwealth, as well as under a king—“ nothing short of such a senate, chosen by the i whole nation, will satisfy us. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 269 “ True generosity, the characteristic of this nation, and of all unperverted men thoughout the globe, calling upon us to countenance at this juncture the arduous struggle of the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 270 French nation against despotism and aristocracy, those foes to the human race, we have 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 271 ‘ resolved upon addressing the French National Convention. You will permit me to observe, this was upon the 11th of October 1792: the king of France was deposed in effect upon the 10th of August 1792. This passage, in the transactions of this society, appears to me te be peculiarly worthy your attention. “ Without entering into the probable effects of such a measure, effects, which your society will notfail to discover, we invite you to join us; and to that end, herewith you have a copy of our intended address; if you approve the idea, and will concur in sending it, be pleased to return us without delay, a copy signed by 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 272 ‘your president: we will then associate yourbody with ours, and with some others, who have already assented to the measure: if, on the contrary, you disapprove that mark of zeal towards the only nation that has hitherto undertaken to restore to mankind its just rights, please to communicate to us your objections. This was upon the 11th of October 1792; upon the 6th of October 1792, Mr. Barlow (whose name occurs before with respect to his publication relative to the privileged orders) writes a letter to the socicty for Constitutional Information, accompanied with a book, called “ Advice to the National Convention of France ; and you will be pleased to observe, that Mr. Barlow, and a Mr. Frost afterwards, in the month of November, were sent with an address from the Constitutional Society to Paris, as their delegates for that purpose, The letter of Mr. Barlow. is in these words: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 273 “ I have lately published a small treatise under the title of ‘A Letter to the Nation “Convention of France, on the Defects of the “Constitution of 1791, and the extent of the “Amendments which ought to be applied :’ although the observations contained in this letter are more particularly applicable to the French nation in the present crisis of its government, yet, as the true principles of society are every where the same, their examination cannot be unseasonable in any nation, or at any time; believing, therefore, that the subject of this treatise will not be thought foreign to the great object of your association, I present a copy of it to you with the same coulidence as I have done to the National Canvention, and to the Constitutional Society at London, a confidence arising trom the full persuasion that the work is founded in truth and reason. I take the liberty at the same time to send you a copy of another publication, intituled ‘ Advice to Privileged Orders.’ The present disposition in Europe towards a geneTal revolution in the principles of government is founded in the current of opinin, too powerful to be resisted, as well as too sacred to be treated. with negicct; and it is the duty of every individual to assist, not only in removing the obstructions that are found in the way of this revolution, but in ascertaining, with as much precisivn as possible, the nature of the object to be aimed at, and the consequence to be expected from the attainment: it is above all things to be desired, that the convictions to be acquired from national discussion should precede and preclude those which must result from physical exertion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 274 Now, you will give me leave to state to you what the doctrine is in this book, for which the Society for Constitutional Information, Mr. Hardy then a member of it, thank Mr. Barlow, make him an honorary member, and afterwards depute him to the National Convention of France1. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 275 Gentlemen, the doctrine, I can explain it to you generally, without troubling you by readAng particular passages, amounts to this: Mr. Barlow, after stating the principles of equal active citizenship, which found their way into the constitution of France in 1791, and which constitution had made the king a part of the system of that government, informs them of the glorious victory of the 10th of August, as the papers, which I have to adduce presently, represent it; that it had accomplished finally the effect of those principles, which he understands to be the principles of those to whom he was writing; that it is impossible they should consist with this sentiment, (hat a king could be retained in a government; that the constitution was at variance with itself; that those who made it had not discovered that, or, having discovered it, they thought the time was not yet come, when they could reduce the constitution to that pure government which was the objectof these societies; hethen tells you, that in government the maxim being that a king can do no wrong, the maxim onght to be, that he can du no good. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 276 This gentleman, so stating his doctrine as an explanation of the principles upon which they are acting, is voted by them an honorary member, and afterwards sent to Paris with the papers, which I am about to read to yon: 4 great deal of evidence will be laid before you, to prove that they had beat up all the country for letters and addresses to express the same principles to France, uot on account of the cause of France, but of the cause of England, and with a view to introduce the same effects into England. I shall state but two of these addresses, because they seem to cuntain the effect of all the rest that were actue ally sent. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 277 The London Corresponding Society first of all communicated to the Constitutional Society, in the month of October 1792, their intention of sending an address to France: the Constitutional Society fully approve the puts pose; they see the end that it aims at, and they determine not to concur in the same address, but to send a separate address; and in their paper you may see the principles of both to be principles, which were expressed for the very purpose of aiding the co-operation of the societies in excluding the king trom the government of the country, and of raising arepublic. This is the letter: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 278 “ Frenchmen, while foreign robbers are ravaging your territories under the specious pretext of justice, cruelty and desolation leadingin their van, perfidy and treachery bringing up the rear, yet mercy and friendship impudently held forth to the world as the sole motives of their incursions; the oppressed part of mankind—that is, Great Lritain—“ forgetting for a while their own sufferings, feel only for yours,’ and with an anaious eye watch the event, fervently supplicating the Almighty Ruler of the universe to be favourable to your cause, so intimately blended with their own, that cause which upon the 10th of August had excluded the king from the government of the country—“ frowned upon by an oppressive system of control, whose gradual but continued encroachments have deprived this nation of nearly all its boasted liberty, and brought us almust to that abject state of slavery, from which you have so emerged ; five thousand British citizens indignant manfully step forth to rescue their country trom the opprobrium brought upon it by the supine conduct of those in power; they conceive it to be the duty of Britons to countenance and assist, to the utmost of their power, the champions of human happiness, and to swear to a nation, proceeding on the plan you have adopted, an inviolable friendship. Sacred from this day be that friendship between us, and may vengeance, to the uttermost, over: take the man who hereafter shall attempt to cause a rupture. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 279 “ Though we appear so few at present, be assured, Frenchmen, that our number increases daily: it is true, that the stern uplifted arm of authority at present keeps back the timid; that busily circulated impostures hourly mislead the credulous ; and that court intimacy with avowed French traitors has sume ellect on the unwary and on the ambitious; but with certainty we can inform you, friends and freemen, that information makes a rapid progress among us; curiosity has taken possession of the public mind; the conjoint reign of ignorance and despotism passes away; men now ask each other, What is freedom? what are our rights? Frenchmen, you are already free, and Britons are preparing to become so; casting far from us the criminal prejudices arttully inculcated by evil-minded men and wily courtiers, we, instead of natural enemies, at length discover in Frenchmen our fellow-citizens of the world, and our brethren by the samc heavenly Father, who created us for the purpose of loving and mutually assisting each other, but not to hate, and to be ever realy to cuteach other’s throats at the command of weak and ambitious kings, and corrupt ministers; seeking our real encmies, we find them in our bosoms, we feel ourselves inwardly torn by and ever the victim of a restless and all-consuming aristocracy, hitherto the bane of every nation under the sun; wisely have you acted in expelling it from France. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 280 “ Warm as our wishes are for your success, eager as we are to behold freedom triumphant, and man every where restored to the enjoyment of lis just rights, a sense of our duty, as orderly citizens, forbids our flying in arms to your assistance ; our government has pledged the national faith to remain neutral in a struggle of liberty against despotism. Britons remain neutral !—O shame! but we have trusted our king with discretionary powers; we therefore must obey: our hands are bound, but our hearts are free, and they are with you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 281 “ Let German depots act as they please, we shall rejuice at their fall; compassionating however their enslaved subjects, we hope this tyranny of their masters will prove the means of reinstating in the full enjoyment of their rights and liberties millions of our fellowcreatures. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 282 “ With unconcern therefore we view the elector of Hanover,—that is, the king of 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 283 Great Britain—join his troops to traitors and robbers ; but the king of Great Britain will do well to remember, that this country is not Hanover. Should he forget this distinction, we will not. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 284 “ While you enjoy the envied glory of being the unaided defenders of freedom, we fondly anticipate in idea the numerous blessings mankind will enjoy; if you succeed, as we ardently wish, the triple alliance (not of crowns, but) of the people of America France, and Britain, will give freedom to Europe, and peace to the whole world. Dear friends you combat for the advantage of the human race; how well purchased will be, though at the expense of much blood, the glorious unprecedented privilege of saying,— Mankind is free: tyrants aud tyranny are no more : , and this is e reigns on the the wesk of Frenchmen. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 285 Gentlemen, this address, which was sent by that society, was followed by another from the Society for Constitutional Information, upon the 9th of November 1792, which seems likewise to state their principles. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 286 “ Servants of a sovereign people, and benefactors of mankind : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 287 “ We rejoice that your revolution has arrived at that point of perfection which will permit us to address you by this title,’—Servants of a sovereign people. That is not the character of a British government; this is the principle of the Southwark resolutions—“ it is the only one which can accord with the character of true legislators. Every successive epoch in your affairs has added something to the triumphs of liberty and the glorious victory of the 10th of August has finally prepared the way for a constitution, which we trust you will establish on the basis of reason and nature. Mr. Barlow had in effect said and they had made him an honorary member, and had transmitted their address by his hands), that no constitution could reform upon the basis of reason and nature, that left aking in the government, however the gor vernment was modified. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 288 They proceed thus in their address— “ Considering the mass of delusion, accumuJated on mankind to obscure their understandy ings, you cannot be astonished at the opposition, that you have met buth from tyrants and from slaves ; the instrument used against you by each of these classes is the same, tor, in the genealogy of human miseries, ignorance is at once the parent of oppression and the child of submission. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 289 “ The events of oer day are proving, that your cause is cherished by the people in all your continental vicinity: that a majority of each of those nations are your real friends, whose governments have tutored them into apparent foes; and that they only wait to be delivered by your arms from the dreadful necessity of fighting against them, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 290 “ The condition of Englishmen is less to be deplored ; here the hand of oppression has not yet ventured completely to ravish the pen from us, nor openly to point the sword at you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 291 ? They then go on to say : “ From bosoms burning with ardour in your cause, we tender you our warmest wishes for the full extent of ts progress and success; it is indeed a sacred cause; we cherish it as the pledge of your happiness, our natural and nearest friends, and we rely upon it as the bond of fraternal union to the human race, in which union our own nation will surely be one of the first to concur. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 292 “ Qur government has still the power and perhaps the inclination to employ hirelings to contradict us; but it is our real opinion, that we now speak the sentiments of a great majority of the English nation. The people here are wearied with imposture, and worn out with war, they heve learned to reflect that beth the age and the other are the offspring of unnatural combinations if society, as relative to systems of government, not the result of the natural temper of nations as relative to each others happiness. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 293 “ Go on, legislators, in the work of human happiness; the benefit will in part be ours, but the glory shall be all your own; it Is the reward of your perseverance, it is the prize of virtue, the sparks of liberty preserved in EngJand for ages, like the coruscations of the Northern Aurora, serving but to show the darkness visible in the rest of Europe. The lustre of the American republic, like an effulgent morning, arose with increasing vigour, but still too distant to enlighten our hemisphere, till the splendour of the French revolution burst forth upon the nations in the full fervour of a meridian sun, and displayed,—attend to the words—“in the midst of the European world the practical result of principle which hilosophy had sought in the shade of speculation, and which experience must every where confirm,—the principles of Mr. Paine, who went over to form one in that convention, the existence of which shows the practical result of those principles, which philosophy had sought, and which experience was to confirm —it dispels the clouds of prejudice from all people, reveals the secrets of all despotism, and creates a new character in man. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 294 “ In this career of improvement, your example will be soon followed; for nations, rising from their lethargy, will reclaim the rights of man with a voice which man cannot resist. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 295 Gentlemen, it will not be matter of surprise to you, that letters, such as these to the National Convention in France, should have produced opinions in that country respecting the attachment of individuals in this to their government. It is not therefore very extraordinary, that, upon the 19th of November 1792, that famous decree passed of fraternization with all subjects in all countries, who chose to resist the governments under which they live; but I think you will be surprised that any men could receive in this country, and read with approbation, and enter upon their proceedings, the answers which these addresses brought from France, and which were read in the presence of the prisoner at the bar, without being astonished that they did not at least take some means to reject from them the imputation that they meant in their own country, all that these answers suppose they mean, and all that these answers promise to assist them in accomplishing. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 296 You will find, upon the 14th of December 1792, that a letter from the Society of the Friends of Liberty and Equality, sitting’ at Laon, the head of the department of the Aisne, to the Patriotic Society of London, called the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 297 “Society for Constitutional Information, is read, and referred to their Committee of Correspondence: it isin these words : The Society of the Friends of Liberty and Equality sitting at Laon, the head of the department of the Aisne, to the Patriotic Society of London, called the Society for Constitutional Information
ATTORNEYGENERAL 299 Gentlemen, they then enter upon the minutes of the society another letter, from another fraternizing society,—whether one of those societies which they speak of in the beinning of 1792, as aftiliating societies in rance, or not, I do not know; whether they had been assisting to reduce their principles into practicedo not know; but it is clear, that the affiliating society in France offered them their assistance for that purpose. Accordingly, you will find that the Society of the Tats of Liberty and Equality, established at Macon, write to the Constitutional Society at London, adverting to what they had said in their address to the nation about the glorious victory of the 10th August 1792, the circumstances of which shall be described to you in evidence, because you will find that some of the persons who are charged in this indictment (and whose conduct in this conspiracy, will, upon the clearest principles of law, affect all of them) were then present in Paris. They write thus—“ Yes, citizens, our brethren and friends, the 10th of August 1792 shall be distinguisled—what, in the annals of France
ATTORNEYGENERAL 301 “ Our first constitution had consecrated them, but had not always taken them for its base : the dominion of the passions, the force of habit, the impression of prejudices, and the power of the intrigues empiged in our Constituent Assembly, found the secret to preserve sufficient authority to our tyrants, to extinguish at some time the sacred rights of nature, and to re-establish despotism on its throne of iron. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 302 ‘ But royalty, thus preserved, was not content with the victory secured to it by a set of men, the greatest part of whom it had corrupted. It was impatient to reap the fruits that it appeared to promise itself; but its too great eagerness has hastened its ruin, and secured the triumph of reason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 303 «¢ The French, proud of their own existence, soon perceived the fruit of their first legislature ; became sensible of the imperfections of their first laws, saw that they made a surrender of the rights of liberty and equality, which they had embraced ;. they roused themselves anew to demand at length laws impartial and humane. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 304 “ From thence the necessary day of the 10th of August 1792, from thence a second revolution, but a revolution, which is only the completion of the first, which has received our vows and our oaths, and which we will bless for ever, if it leads us, as we hope it will, to the happiness of the nation, to the constant maintenance of liberty and equality. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 305 Let intriguers, fools, and tyrants, calumniate us; we despise them too much to condescend to answer them, and seek for their esteem. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 306 “ That which flatters us is the interest that you take in our labours: your attention has contributed to the success of our arms. We desire your esteem, we are proud of your approbation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 307 “ We smile at the expression of the sentiments that you manifested to our representatives. We behold a nation of brethren rouse itself to support the cause of humanity; we behold the brave English adopt our principles, become our friends: we say to each other with pleasure, soon will they become our allies; and uniting our efforts, we shall go on to deliver the universe from the yoke of tyrants, to restore the nations to reason and nature. That day is not far distant, if we may rely on our own courage, and the hope of youralliance. In the mean time, receive our thanks, and corTespond with brethren who set a high value upon your esteem. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 308 Gentlemen, on the 17th of December 1792, the Popular and Republican Society of another department at the mouth of the Rhone, wrote them this letter: he Popular and Republican Society of Apt, department of the Mouths of the Rhone to the Popular Society sitting ut London. Live free or die. Citizens, brethren, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 309 ’ and friends, when two great nations, acquainted with their rights, approximated by their commercial connexions and their national situation, formed to live and to act in concert with each other, begin to form the glorious project of uniting themselves for the regeneration of the human race, one may then say with reason that kings are ripe and ready to fall. How glorious it will be for France and England to have furmed alone a confederacy destructive of tyrants, and to have purchased at the price of their blood the liberty of Europe; we may say more, of the whole universe! Courage, brethren and friends! I¢ is for you to follow in the glorious and hazardous career of the revolution of the world; can you any longer groan under the yoke of a overnment that has nuthing of liberty but the name? for, althuugh your land was inhabited before ours by freemen, can you, with. out delusion, consider your government as such? Will you content yourselves with a partial frecdom? Will the English be satisfied with principles? Will that bold nation, that has produced philosophers the most profound, and that first of all perceived the sparkling rays of freedom, remain a spectatrix in so noble a cause? No, brethren and friends, no? you will soon lift yourselves up against that perfidious court of St. James's, whose infernal policy, like that which found its doom in the Thuilleries, has made so many victims in our two nations, and does disunite them peretually to rule over them. Your love for iberty has fixed your attention upon the wants of our defenders: your generosity towards them has a title to the a kaow ele ment of the republic; we are impatient to furnish you the same advantages: the Popular Societies of France desire ardently the epoch that shall permit them to address their voice to the National Assembly of Great Britain, and to offer to the soldiers of liberty of your nation, arms, bayonets, and pikes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 310 This is the private correspondence between the socictics and the Society for Constitutional Information; but some of the persons named in this Indictment were present at the scenes I am now going to state at the bar of the National Convention in France; others of them delivering these sentiments by their ambassador Mr. Barlow whose principles you have seen, and Mr. Frost, of whom I must state it, because I shall prove it, that he has been convicted in this country of coming from that country with the doctrine of No King; they offer these addresses to the -National Convention of France in terms, the substance of which I will state to you as far as I understand it, to be, and I believe it is an accurate translation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 311 “ Mr. Barlow and Mr. Frost, English citizens, being admitted to the bar, one of them pronounced the following address
ATTORNEYGENERAL 313 “ Citizens of France, we are deputed from the Society for Constitutional Information in London, to present to you their congratulations on the triumphs of liberty. This Society had laboured long in the cause with little prospect of success previous to the commencement of your revolution; conceive then their exultations and gratitude when, by the astonishing efforts of your nation, they beheld the reign of reason acquiring an extension and solidity which promised to reward the labour of all good men, by securing the happiness of their fellow-creatures. nf mrenitas societies of a similar nature are now forming in every part of England, Scotland and Ireland; they excite a spirit of universal inquiry into the complicated abuses of government, and the simple means of areform. Afterthe example which France has given, the science of revolutions will be rendered easy, and the progress of reason will be rapid. It would not be strange if, in a period tar short of what we should venture to predict, addresses of felicitation should cross the seas to a National Convention in England. We are also commissioned to inform the Convention, that the society which we represent has sent to the soldiers of liberty & patriotic donation of a thousand pair of shoes, which are by this time arrived at Calais; and the society will continue sending a thousand pair a week for at least six weeks to come; we only wish to know to whose care they ought to be addressed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 314 Why, gentlemen, am I to be told then, that, in the month of November 1792, those who, in August 1792 had said they could ap
ATTORNEYGENERAL 315 Ply with no effect to parliament, had no idea ! of si uch a National Convention in England as that National Convention in France which they were addressing, and from which they were expecting to receive addresses? Am I to be told that they had no idea of such & convention, as should overturn the constitution of this country? It is impossible to put sucha construction uponsuch proceedings. Gentlemen, you will likewise nd that the president of the Convention thought it necessary to give an answer to this address. I will state the substance of it: it will be read in evidence: therefore I shall not take up time in looking for it. The president considering them as generous republicans (and well he might after what had passed), makes an address to them, expressing much the same sentiments as those 1n which they had addressed him, and then he concludes by saying— “Without doubt the time approaches when we shall soon send congratulations to the National Convention of England. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 316 Gentlemen, you will likewise find that the London Corresponding Society, and the Constitutional Society, endeavoured to excite persons in all parts of this kingdom to send these addresses ; that in point of fact, there are various other addresses sent, of similar import, at the instigation of these societies, and the intent of them, I think, cannot possibly be-misunderstood: but take the intent of them to be what you will, let my learned friend tell you, as he will, that there as yet was no war between Great Britain and France you will allow me to say that there is evidence ofa distinct intent that there should be a National Convention in England, and thet the French soldiers of liberty should assist what they would call the soldiers of our liberty, whether there should be a war between Great Britain and France, or not: and vou will allow me to say, that in that very month of November 1792, a passage occurs, in which France does in effect declare war against ail nations that did not adopt her principles, and allow the people to put them into execution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 317 In a conspiracy, as widely extended as this is, I shall undoubtedly insist, before you and the Court, that the acts of individuals, and particularly the acts of persons sent to present addresses to a foreign country, that what they doin reference to these acts is evidence against all ofthem; and likewise that letters which the persons write relative to the same addresses, are evidence against each of them whether written by the particular individual or no, as being in the prosecution of the same purpose. Upon the 20th of September 1792, Mr. Frost, who was then at Paris, states his Notions in a letter to Mr. Tooke, of the rca! effect of this transaction of the 1uth of August 1792, about which time Mr. Paine made his first appearance in the National Convention —“ Without the affuir of the 10th of August liberty was over—We dine to-day with Petion —Paine has entered his name on the roll of parliament, and went through the forms of office with a great deal of nonchalance—We are well ludged, and beside our bed-rooms, have an entertaining room for members to be shown into, and several have called upon us this morning. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 318 Then you will find, that there being a project to send shoes to the soldiers of France, and arms and muskets, with respect to which project the prisoner was a contributor —for the purpose of having this present trom England to France properly distributed in France, the fullowing letter is written to the mayor of Paris: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 319 “ Sir, You are in no want of friends in England, who ardently wish to be useful tu French liberty; but we wish to know some one of your friends who resides in London, in whow you have af entire confidence, and to whom we may give Our money, in the assurance that it will be remitted to you withont delay, and without fraud. Mr. Frost to whom T entrust this letter, 18 going to set out imme diately with Mr. Paine for Paris, and aliows me ne time for ceremony, if it were necessary. I request you to scnd me the name of some Frenchman in London, merchant, or other, for the purpose above mentioned. We can now begin the public contribution towards our patriotic gift with a -thousard pounds sterling, and I have no doubt’ but it will amount in time to several thousands; if you consider this step in the same point of view that we do, you. will see in it much tuse to the common cause in England and ! by no means such as were cakulated in any 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 320 France. 1 entreat you to give me your sentifrents upon the subject, and to point out to me the means by which I may be useful to This is answered, upon the 1st of October, by Petion,; thus—“ You cannot, sir, doubt of my eagerness to second views so useful, which will for evec merit our gratitude, will zivet the links of fraternity between us, and must duce the greatest advantages to England and France. sending you without delay, the name of the person in whose hands you may place the funds whieh you destine to the support of a cause which, in truth, is that of all people who cherish liberty. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 321 Gentlemen, it may be iti the recollection of perhaps most who now hear me, that circumstances of this sort, which were supposed to be in existence, but, which, in fact, were not capable of being proved to be in existence, had excited in this country considerable alarm in the minds of many persons who live in it. This alarm, it seems to have been thought necessary, both in the Constitutional Society, and-also in the London Corresponding Society, in some degree to lay asleep, as far as it affected them; they thought it necessary, therefore, to give some declaration, as they call it, of their principles, and I will state to you shortly what that was—but the explanation, which the London Corresponding Society gave, was thought so little safe, though it was given for the purpose of laying asleep alarms, that it will be distinctly proved to you—that being written as I am instructed to state to you (and I do it because I am instructed, and it is my duty), ps Rec by Mr. Vaughan, it was agreed to be stuck up round the town at midnight—that aceordingly a person of the name of Carter, a billsticker, was employed for that purpose ; — that sonte tnistake happened betweerhim and his employers; that having made that mistake, he was not thought a proper person to be employed in considerable business in the society afterwards: this mn was taken up in the act of sticking the bills round this town, whieh contains this address—he was prosecuted—he was convicted—and lay six montha in a gaol in consequence of that conviction ; and this was the fate that attended the issuing into the world an address, which was to appear not originally by daylight, but by midnight. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 322 With respect to the address of the Constitutional Society, I think I shall not be thought to make an unfair observation upon it when I say this—that if I had not read to you what I have already read, you would have found it impossible to say what it was, upon reading that paper that they meant to say, who published it; but after what I have read to you T think you can have no difficulty to determine that the paper they published, and the paper of the Corresponding Society, were 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 323 I shall have the honour, sir, of manner to disavow those principles, which I think I have shown you satisfactorily, from March 1792, were the principles they acted upon and adopted. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 324 Gentlemen, the address of the London Corresponding Society is in these words — “ Friends and fellow-countrymen, unless we: are greatly deceived, the time is approaching when the object for which we struggle is likely to come within our reach, That a nation, like Britons, should be free, it is requix site only that Britons should will it, to become so’—that is a passage borrowed trom Mf. Paine—“ that such should be their will—the abuses of our original constitution, and the alarms of our aristocratic enemies, sufficiently witness: confident in the pony of our motives, and in the jastice of our cause, let us meet falsehood with proofs, and hypocrisy with plainness ; let us persevere in declaring our principles, and misrepresentation will nicet its due reward—contempt. In this view the artifices Of a late aristocratic association, formed on the 20th instant call for a few remarks on account of the declarations they have published, relative to other clubs and societies formed in this nation. It is true that this meeting of gentlemen (for so they style themselves) have mentioned no names, instanced no facts, quoted no authoritiesit was a little difficult to do it, unless 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 325 ‘they had the means of seeing all the correspondences at home and abroad but they take upon themselves to assert that bodies of their countrymen have been associated, professing opinions favourable to the rights of man, to liberty and equality’—mark these expressions—“ and moreover that these opinions are conveyed in the terms, no king, no parliament. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 326 Gentlemen, what I have been endeavouring to state to you is this, that it is necessarily to be inferred from their principles that they did mean to assert, when they were ripe for it, no king, no parliament: it is pot my imputation—I do not know whose it was, to which this alludes, that they did express their opinion in the language, no king, no parliament 5 but I say that they expressed their opinions in lan e, whieh, when accutately looked af, as forcibly import the ideas, as if they had used the wine no king, no parliament—“ if this be intended to include the societies to which we respectively belong, we here, in the most solemn manner, deny the latter of the charge
ATTORNEYGENERAL 328 -thus—“ Let us wait and watch the ensuing session of parliament, from whom we have much to hope and little to fear. The House of Commons may have been the source of our calamity, it may prove that of our deliverance; should it not, we trust we shall not prove unworthy of our forefathers, whose exertions in the cause of mankind so well deserve our imitation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 329 Now, gentlemen, I ask, after concluding this letter, what this means—“ if parliament should not do it.If we are ready to admit that parliament is formed upon principles that make it competent to do the thing, if it please to do it, it is all well; but if it will not, then we will not prove unworthy of our forefathers, whose exertions in the cause of mankind so well deserve our imitation—and referring you back te the coeeeapemdts between the Norwich and the London Corresponding Society, to the declaration of the 6th of August 1792, which said they had nothing to look for from parliament—to the correspondence with the National Convention of France—to the conduct, which in the presence of their delegates, was permitted—and never repudiated by any act-of the London Corresponding Society; and referring you, moreover, to the subsequent evidence, which I have to offer to you; I think you will find that the sentiment which is expressed by the author of this paper, upon the 19th of November 1792, was a sentiment which, if followed up by those who continue to hold it, meant that, if parliament did not 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 330 “give them redress, they would have it by their own force. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 331 With respect to the Constitutional Society, all it thinks proper to say upon the subject is this : “ that the object of this society, from its first institution to the present moment of alarm, has uniformly been, to promote the welfare of the people—Ibeg your attention to these words—“ has uniformly been to promote the welfare of the people by all constitutional means.—Now if I were to stop here, with a view to show yeu what you are to understand by the words,—“ all constitutional means—are the means I have been stating unstitutional means? Will it make the means more constitutional than they really are, because thpy choose to call them so
ATTORNEYGENERAL 333 “Resolved, ¢dly—That this society disclaims the idea of wishing toeffecta change in the pe sent system of things by violence and public commotion, but that it trusts to the good sense of the people—You will find, before I have done, that, in April 1793, it could not trust to the sense of the people— when they ehall be fully enlightened on the subject to wre, without disturbing the public tranquillity, an effectual and permanent reform. Resolved, Sdly—That the intentions of this and similar societies have of late been grossly calumniated by those who are interested to perpetuate abuses, and their agents, who have been industrious to represent the members of such societies, as men of dangers ous principles, wishing to destroy all social order, disturb the state of property, and introduce anarchy and confusion instead of regular government. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 334 “ Resolved, 4thly—That, in order to-counteract the operation of such gross aspersions, and to prevent them from checking the proere of liberal inquiry, it is at this time pecoiarly expedient that this and similar societies should publicly assert the rectitude of their prineiples, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 335 “ Resolved—That the said resolutions be adopted, in order for printing in the news rs. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 336 ow I desire any person to read that paper through again, a hen, gentlemen of the jury, if it is relied upon, be 30 good as to ask yourselves what is the definite meaning in any one passage in it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 337 About the same time there is an address from the Manchester Socicty, dated the 14th of Decemher 1792, which appears to have been read in the Constitutional Society, in the presence of the prisoner, and which address some very particular circumstances about it, for you will find that there was a resohution upon the 14th of December 1792, in these words—“ Read a printed address from Manchester—Resolved, that the said address be approved for publishing in the Hemapapers 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 338 It appears by a paper, which I shall produce to you, that the words Read a printed address from Manchester, are in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke; that the address itself is in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke; whether it was a copy of any address at Manchester or not, I do not know : this address appears a! to be in print; it is seut for publication; and with a view to show to the public what extent the Sstniba on of here has arisen to Aan the progress of a treasonable purpose this address was ordered ta be printed, and that a hundred thousand copies of it should be distributed to their correspondents in Great Britain and Ireland
ATTORNEYGENERAL 340 Now, in this paper, which bears date wpon the 14th of December 1792, and recollecting, as I hope you will do, what I have ly stated to you of the principles of those who were concerned in this transaction, as these principles had been manifested in all the other transactions, I have stated to you, you will find there is this passage: he says— To gull the poor witb the insolent falsehood, that the laws are the same for the poor as the rich, or with idle panegyrics on a rotten constitution, which you have not examined, and of whicb you feel not the benefit—The real friends of the people hear with pity and bear with patience the hourly calumnies to which they are exposed ; they entertain, however, no personal enmities, no aversion, but to the enemies of the people, and no disrespect to the constitution, but where it is hostile to the rights of the people. Now, why it is said to be hostile to the tights of the people, I think, can be pretty well understood, after what I have stated to ou about these communications with France, t it need not be left there, for you will find that this is more distinctly stated in the draught of an answer toa letter, which was likewise read and entered among the minutes of this society upon the 6th of October 1792: the draught of the answer scems to have been prepared on the 2nd November 1792 ; it was to be sent to the editors of the Patriot. The editors of the Patriot were persons who were living at Sheffield; and it will appear by the rs, the substance of which I have not really ily strength enough to state to you, were affiliated at the same time with the London Corresponding Society, aud also with the Constitutional Socicty, in the propagation of their paces and this in an extent, which no j|anguage can do justice to, which it is imposable to describe to you without reading a particular letter, in which they themselves state their mode of procceding, and which, for the purpose of informing you in this respect, shall be presently read to you: to one-of them the following is an answer, and I beg your attention to it, of the 2nd of Nov. 1792. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 341 “ We rejoice with you in the increase of the members of the societies of freedom ; our bosoms glow with the sentiments—we are brothers in affection with you, and with the freemen of Stockport’—(who wrate that letter which I before observed upon, which states that nothing can do but a convention, and that their object is a government immediately constituted by the people: that that cannot be while the Crown or the Lords, as you choose to cunstrue the letter, retain their authority)—They add—““ Freedom, though an infant, makes “ Herculean efforts—Now they Meant nothing in the world to the prejudice of the monarchy, they meant nothing in the world but a full representation of the ree inaparliament co-existing with king and lords. They add —“ The vipers, aristocracy, that is, persons who have got coats upon their backs—“ and Monarchy—we have it yet in England, gentlemen—“ are panting and writhin Wnder its grasp: may success, peace, ani happiness attend those efforts! — That letter, so prepared, will be produced to you, with the corrections of Mr. Horne Tooke, in his own hand. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 342 Gentlemen, I have now gone through, as well as I am able,—and I hope you will keep in view the case I have stated,—the principles and practices of these societies, with all their affiliations. I ought to mention to you, that you will find ia the evidence, as itis laid efore you, most uncommon industry in picking up fresh connexions. If a paper appeared in the country, stating that a socicty of any sort was formed, you will find immediate industry to connect them, and affiliate them with the London Corresponding and Constitutional Societies. If these societies professed —as, for instance, the Stockport Society professed—that they would have nothing but a government constituted immediately by themselves, they contrive to give an answer satisfactory to them. If the societies professed attachment to the monarchy, and desired explanation whether they meant Mr. Pitt's plan, which Mr. Paine laughs at, or whether they meant the duke of Richmond’s plan—or whether they meant, as a letter, you will hear by and by, says, to rip up monarchy by the roots, you will find they satisfied them all sufficiently to enlist them all for that purpose, which from their own transactions, I state to be neither more nor less, than to do what Mr. Paine did in his book, to combine the principles, which they stated, when the times were ripe for it, with the practices which were correspondent with those principles; to apply those principles, which were alike the principles of these societies and of the French constitution of 1791, and which Mr. Paine, Mr. Barlow, and those addressers to the convenion, receiving such answers from the convention in 1792, declared bad produced a constitution in France upon the 10th of August 1792, to apply them not to form that, which in its nature is an absurdity, a royal democracy, but that which upon principle is consistent, though it ita wretched bad governMent, a representative government, to be exchanged here in lieu of our limited monarchy, in lieu of our government, under which I state it, with a defiance to the world to tell me that I do not state it truly, that a people never did enjoy, since the providence of God made us a people (you may talk about theories as you please), that they never did enjoy, for so long atime together, such a quantum of actual private happiness and private prosperity, public happiness and public prosperity, under any constitution, as we have enjoyed under the constitution, to the destruction or the support of which it is for you to judge whether such means, as I have been stating to you, were designed to be esuployed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 343 ‘The next thing that was to be done, was to go on in strengthening themselves by affiliation ; and you will fin eager that they have connexions at Norwich, Shefheld, Leeds, and other places: indeed, there was hardly a county, in which they had not affiliated societics, and, if you believe them, to great numbers. The next step they took was, not that they should have it accomplished—their principles would not let them accomplish it—but it was for the purpose of attaching more and more affiliated societies, that they began now to think, in the year 1793, of making applica“tions to parliament. gentlemen, mn the course of that year, 1793, whilst they are to make applications to parliament, you will find that they distinctly discuss the utility of doing so. The London Corresponding Society, it will be proved to you, take the opinion of the socicties in the country with respect to three distinct propositions. Mark this. Now, gentlemen, in September 1792, the Stockport Society told the London Corresponding Society that there was no hope of doing any thing but in a convention; the London Corresponding Society give the answer that I have before stated. They began to think of this thing called a convention in the beginnir g of the year 1793, and they propose having communication, on the other hand, from the country societies. They State three propositions—W hat is it we are to do 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 345 liament did not attend to; I mean petitions to introduce a change in the government upon the principle of annual suffrage and universal Tepresentation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 346 They determined for the present that they would content themselves with petitions: that this would occasion a great deal of debate: that that would give them a vast variety of opportunities of discussing the point they had had in agitation since 1792; and, if the public mind was not ripe for a convention in 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 347 1798, the proceedings and transactions of 1793, had a natural and obvious tendency, when these transactions were made a proper use of, to bring to maturity the project, not yet Come to maturity: you will find therefore that both the London maneeyning Eee and the Society for Constitutional Information keep this object in view. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 348 The Norwich Society, upon the 5th of March 1793, write thus to the Society for Constitutional Information, and which you will see had held correspondence also with the London Corresponding Society upon the subject of the same proposition : “ It is with peculiar satisfaction that we are favoured with your correspondence,—they first ssy—“ We wish to find out a method of redress; at present we see a great propriety in universal suffrage and annual elections; but we beg will be obliging enough to inform us of wl you have collected of the sense of the people by your correspondence: we have to inform you that our worthy Corresponding Societies of London have recently submitted three propositions for our investigation ; first, whether a petition to parliament, or an address to the king, or a convention. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 349 When I find here the word convention, I think I may address this question to you as nen of common sense; if, in August 1792, the London Corresponding Society, by the address which I have read to you, have told you distinetly that they cannot get any redress from parliament, is it not marvellous how it is to be made out in argument, that, in March 1793, they were to have a convention in ordet to get it from parliament, and more i larly to get it from that parliament, which, upon their owp principles was not tent to give it, if they had a mind to take it from parliament? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 350 “ Permit us briefly to state our views for your revisal ; and with respect to the first, we behold we are a conquered people; we have tamely submitted to the galling yeke, and resistance in the present circumstances is vain; we cannot, we cannot act the man; and, 88 necessity has no law, we think ourselves under that degrading necessity to state our grievances to the House of Commons, with a request for redress; and should they refuse— which they did—“ to grant our reasonable petition, we have still got (no thanks to them)—here is an accurate, a short descrij tion of the affiliated societies—“ a formidab! engine, that will couvey the insult to the remotest parts of the kingdom: as to the propriety of the second, we wish to submit to your superior judgment, and should esteem it a favour to be informed of the result; fer at Present we are dubious of its good conseuences. Lastly, a cunvention ; and oh! that the period were arrived; but in the present state of affairs, alas! it is impracticable ; yet this is the object we pursue, and esteem any other means only in subordination to, and as having a tendency to accomplish that able end. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 351 “ We wish to be in unison with. our breahren and fellow labvurers, and should be glad of any information, as soon as it is convenient; and we beg your advice whether it is necessary, as soon as possible, to collect signatures to a petition for a real representation of the people 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 352 This letter, of the 5th of March 1793, having been received from Norwich, you will find that Mr. Frost, who had then lately come from France, and was about that time, I believe, talking of no king in this country, in which it is not yet quite lawful to say so, was thought an extremely proper pergon to draw up a letter in answer to this; and accordingly it is stated upon the books of the society, that Mr. Frost was ordered to prepare that answer: however, it got into abler- hands; for, unless i am again misinstructed, it was settled by counsel, and the substance I will now read to you. It is dated the 16th of April 1793. “ From the seeretary of the Society for Constitutional Information to the secretary of the United Political Societies at Norwich
ATTORNEYGENERAL 354 “ That the constitution of England has no more of that character it once possessed ; that the supposed democracy of the country has become a matter of property and privilege ; and that we have therefore no longer that mixed government, which our adversaTies are praising, when they know it is no longer in our possession, are facts notorious and indisputable: where then are we to look for remedy 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 356 Now, who are ourselves? why, those affiliated societies! “ ourselves represented in some meeting of delegates for the extensive purpose of reform, which-we suppose you understand by the term convention. The Norwich Society writes to the Constitutional Society, and it proposes a convention as the only means of doing this business. The Constitutional Society states that it is to be done only in a convention,—of what? of themsclves. Why then, I say, upon the 16th of April, 1798, the Constitutional Society construed the acts of the 20th of January, 1794, which I shall allude to presently, and the 27th of March, 1794, because the Constitutional Society, said that a convention was a convention of themselves, represented in some meeting of delegates,—and for what purpose ? for the extensive purposes of reform; how ? byapplyingtoparliament? No. Why, thispassage states expressly that the reason why they would have a convention was, because they would not apply to parliament; and canIimpute to men of understanding, that are employed in this business, for there ere merf of understanding enough employed in this business; whether that understanding is. properly employed in this business, it is not for me to say any thing about—can I impute any thing so absurd to men of understanding as that they meant to form a convention, which convention should carry their petition to parliament? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 357 t is the end of each of these propositions that we ought to look to; and, as success in a good cause must be the effect of perseverance and the rising reason of the time, let us determine with coolness, but Ict us persevere with decision. As to a convention, we regard it as a plan the most desirable and most practicable ;—when? so soon as the great body of the people shall be virtuous enough to joinusin the attempt? No—but “so soon as the great hody of the people shall be courageous and virtuous enough to join usin the attempt. You will see whether the interpretation which I give of the word “ courageous by the manner in which I mean to expressit, is due to it or not, by what I have to state to you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 358 Gentlemen of the jury, with a view to explain this thing called a convention, as contradistinguished from parliament, give me leave to carry back, your attention for a moment to January 25, 1793. In this society, which, in November, 1792, had the correspondence with France, which I stated, in January, 1793, when we were on the eve ofa war, and upon the eve of a war which had been produced by the “principles which brought fraternization into’ this, country, and took place soon after that decree of 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 359 November,. 1792, you will find that these resolutions were come to “ That citizen St. Andre, a member of the National Convention of France,—that convention which had deposed a king, as that which could not exist ina government, formed upon the principles of the rights of man, as disclosed by Mr. Paine, his fellow-member in that convention,—“ as one of the most judicious and enlightened friends of human liberty, be admitted an associated honorary member of this society
ATTORNEYGENERAL 361 “ Resolved, that citizen Roland, being also considered by us as one of the most judicious and enlightened friends of human liberty, be admitted an associated honorary member. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 362 Gentlemen, I particularly request your attention to this—“ that the speeches of citizen St. Andre and citizen Barrere, associated honorary members of this society, as given in the Gazette Nationale, ou Moniteur universel of Paris, on the 4th, 6th, and 7th of January, 1793, be inserted in the books of this society ;—and, as far as this society could effectuate it, they endeavoured also to have these resolutions, lished in the newspapers, and it will be 1n proof to you that, in the books of the society, it is resolved that each of these resolutions should be so published. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 363 Now, gentlemen, I shall prove to you, by evidence completely effectual for that purpose, what these speeches were, and then, if you will be so good as to ask yourselves what the Constitutional Society, which in January and February ordered these speeches to be published, meant by a convention in that letter of the 16th of April, 1793, you will judge whether that convention was to be the means Vege they would neither apply to the ing, the executive power, nor to the parliament), was to be the means of handing their application to parliament or whether, on the other hand, it was to be the means of introducing by its own force, a representative procrmnent in this country? that assembly, which you will find, they insist would for the time absorb all the powers of government, which, if it did exist, would delegate its legislative power only so long as they chose to delegate it, a body competent to create a legislature, and possessing within itself an eternal power of reform, an eternal source of revolution. With respect to St. Andre, speaking to the convention, he says, “ Your right to decide the fate of kings arises from your being a revolutionary assembly created by the nation —a- revolutionary assembly created by the nation in such a state is at least that thin which I think no good Englishman ever wil wish to exist to see—“ a revolutionary assembly, created by the nation in a state of insurrection. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 364 Speaking of the trial of the king of France, mee This proceeding is of the highest importance to public order, absolutely necessary to the existence of liberty, aud connected with whatever is held most sacred by the nation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 365 he people of Paris—This is upon the question whether the person of the king be ioviolable, a maxim unquestionably true ia the constitution of this country, a maxiot perfectly consistent with the civil liberties of the people, because, though the king’s person is inviolable, he has advisers, who are violable as to every act that he does—“ The people of Paris, by making a boly insurrection against the king on the 10th of Angie —that 10th of August, which, in Mr. t's letter to Mr. Tooke, was absolutely necessary to the existence of liberty in France—“ deigs him of his character of inviolability. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 366 he people of the other departments, applauded this insurrection, and adopted the consequence of it. The people have therefore formally interposed to destroy this royal inviolability. The tacit consent of the Lk rendered the person of the king inviolable; the act of insurrection—I pry heaven defend us from the operation of such principles in this country—“ the act of insurzection was a tacit repeal of that consent, and was founded on the same grounds of law as the consent itself; the king’s person is inviolable only with relation to the other branches of the legislature, but not with relation to the people. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 367 Now, I ask, what did those gentlemen, who ordered this speech to be published, that the king’s person is inviolable only with relation to the other branches of the legisla ture, when they were talking of conventions, mean? Iam sorry to say that my mind is drawn to the conclusion that they thought the king’s person was not inviolable with ree lation to the people, a convention of whons was to be formed, and was to be formed because an application to parliament was useless. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 368 Now, let us see the description of a convention. “ A convention differs from an ot dinary legislature in this respect: a legisla ture is only a species of superintending magistracy, a moderator of the powers of government: a convention is a perfect representation of the sovereign: the members of the legislativeassembly acted in August upon these principles, in sammoning the conyention; they declare—precisely as it is declared in the letter I have been reading to you—“ that they saw but one measure which could seye France, namely, to have recourse to the supreme will of the people, and to invite the yee to exercise immediately that upalienale right of sovereignty, which: the constitu: tion had acknowledged, and which it could not subject to any restriction: the public interest required that the people should manifest their will by the election of a Nasional 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 369 Convention, formed of representatives in vested by the people with unlimited powers. The people did manifest their will by the election of that convention. The convention being assembled is itself that sovereign will which ought to prevail. It would be contrary to every principle to suppose that the convention js not alone exclusively the expression of the general will. i 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 370 “¢ The powers of the convention must, from the very nature of the assembly, be unlimited with respect to every measure of general safety, such as the execution of a tyrant. It is no longer a convention, if it has not power to judge the king: a convention is a constituent body, i. e. a body that is to make a constitution ior the people; a legislature makes laws ler an established constitution, and in conformity to it. It is despotism when, in the ordinary and permanent establishment ofa state, there is no separation of powers ; but it is of the very essence of a constituent body to concentre ‘be the time all authority: it is the very nature of a national convention, to be the tempo image of the nation, to unite in itself all the powers of the state, to saploy them against the enemies of liberty, and to distribute them in a new social compact called a constitution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 371 Gentlemen, after I have stated that to you, I think I cannot possibly be mistaken when I conceive that you can do no otherwise than put the same construction upon this letter which I did. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 372 I will now take the liberty of calling your attention to a letter of the 17th of May 1793, and the answer of the 26th May 1793, passing over a tt many letters, the substance of which you will inform yourselves of by having read, namely, letters that prove affiliations solicited and granted to Leeds, Tewkesbury, Coventry, and many places in the kingdom, more numerous than I apprehend bt will believe, till you see what the numof them is, by evidence actually before 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 373 Re ou. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 374 Gentlemen, I beg leave now to call your attention, in order of time, to a letter of the 17th May 1793, for it begins a correspondence Most excessively material with that part of country in which the convention has been already held ; I mean Scotland; a convention which, I think I shall satisfy you, did, for the time, act upon the principles that I have stated to you, from the speech of Barrere, as far as it could act, and in which I think, at the moment that I address you, if it had not been stopped in the execution of its purposes, and had been joined by those whose acts we are considering this day, you might have seen, in the speeches of a national convention in Great Britain, a repetition of the language of Barrere, instead of hearing it from me in a court of justice. Gentlemen, I hold it, in the office that I fill, to be due to the administration of the jus
ATTORNEYGENERAL 375 Uce of this country, to say distinctly, if 1 un- i derstand the case upon which certain persons were tried for the acts which they did in Scotland, that, if they had been tried tor high treason, they would have no right to complain; no right to complain if the question upon their conduct had been agitated in that shape before a jury of the Sout Gentlemen, upon the 17th of May, a Mr. Urquhart going from London, Mr. Hardy, and a Persea of the name of Margarot, celebrated in the future history of this business, join, and write a letter—parliament had, as the expected it would, and as they meant it should, rejected their petition—he London Cor. responding Society eagerly seizes the opportunity of Mr. Urquhart going back to Edinburgh, to request of your society a renewal of correspondence, and a more intimate co-operation in that which both societies alike seck, viz. a reform in the parliamentary representation. We are very sensible that no society can by itself bring about that desirable end : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 376 let us, therefore, unite as much as possible, not only with each other, but with every other society throughout the nation. Our petitions, you will have learned, have bean all of them unsuccessful: our attention must now, therefore, be turned to some more effectual means; from your suciely we would wil. lingly learn them, and you, on your part, may depend upon our adopting the firmest measures, provided they are constitutional, and we hope the country will not be behindhand with us. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 377 Now, by “constitutional measures, it is clear that they meant that a convention, as contradistinguished from a parliament, would be constitutional: it is clear they meant it, because they have said it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 378 Then Mr. Skirvingwrites thus — “ Mr. Urquhart did me the pleasure to call on Thursday afternoon, and delivered your letter of the 17th inst. I am much pleased with the contents of it, and shall lay it before the first meeting of our societies here, which, however, does not take place till Monday sevennight. I would have acknowledged the receipt of your favour by yesterday’s post, but was tou much employed in removing our household to another leising to attend to any thing else. NowI beg your attention to this, because you will see in the transactions of the ople in convention in Edinburgh, that they looked to what they were todo in case of a rebellion as well as any other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 379 feither you in England or we in Scotland should attempt separately, the reform which we, I trust, seek to obtain, we should, by so doing, only expose our weakness, and manifest our ignorance of the corruption which opposes our important undertaking ; if we sought only the extirpation of one set of interested men from the management of national affairs, that place might be given to another set; without affecting the vitals adverse to the system of reform, these might be easily accomplished: but to cut up deep and wide rooted prejudices, to give effectual ener, to the dictates of truth in favour of public virtue and national prosperity, in opposition to self and all its interested habits, and to withstand and overawe the final efforts of the powers of darkness, is the work of the whole, and not ofa part; a work to which mankind till this awfu' poe were never adequate, because never till pow disposed to fraternize, not merely or only, I trust, from the sense of the common danger to which we are exposed, but from the ennobling principle of universal benevolence. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 380 I know no greater service that I can do my country, than to promote the union you so wisely desire: and I am happy to assure you, that I have bitherto discovered no sentiment in our association, adverse to the most intimate and brotherly union with the associations in England. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 381  think the minds of all must in the nature of things be now turned to more effectual soa of reform. Not one person was convinced of the necessity of it by the most convincing arguments of reason, together with the most unequivocal expressions of universal desire. What then is to be hoped for from repetition? Iam only afraid that the bow in England against reform was so contracted, that in returning it may break. You would willingly learn, you say, from us—I own that we ought to be forward in this: we have at once in great wisdom perfected our plan of organization, and if we were in the same independent state of mind as the people of England, we would be able to take the lead, the associations with you are no more, I fear, excuse my freedom, than an aristocracy for the good of the people: they are indeed moderate, firm, and virtuous, and better cannot be; but we are the people themselves, and we are the first to show that the people can both Jute and resolve, if undirected by faction, with both wisdom and moderation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 382 “I have not a higher wish in the present exertions for reform than to see the people universally and regularly associated, because Tam persuaded that the present disastrous engagements will issue in ruin, and the people must then provide for themselves; and it would be unhappy when we should be ready to act with unanimity, to be occupied about organization, without which, however, anarchy must ensue—we will not need but to be prepared for the event—to stand still and see the salvation of the Lord—let us therefore take the hint given us by our opposers; let us begin in earnest to make up our -minds relative ig Pe extent of aber which r ought to seek, be prepared to justify it, and to controvert objections : let us model the whole in the public mind; let us provide every stake and stay of the tabernacle which we would erect, so that when the tabernacles of oppression in the ‘palaces of ambition are brokea down, under the madness and folly of their supporters, we may then, without anarchy aud all dangerous delay, erect at once our tabernacle of righteousness, and may the Lord himself be in it! 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 383 Gentlemen, these are things all very easy tobeunderstood. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 384 “ How hurtful to the feelings of a reflecting mind, to look back to the wretched state in which the Roman monarchy, eafeebled and broken by its own corruptions, left the nations, which it subjected, like sheep without a shepherd; they soon became a prey to every invader, because there was mone to gather and unite them; had they, foreseeing the evil, associated for mutual defence, -no robber would have been able to enslave them ; would have given laws to all parties, as as to themselves: all separate colonies and nations would have sought their alliance ; but not having virtue to associate, and heal the divisions, and root out the selfish spirit, which ambition-fostering governments procure to their subjects, they fell under oppressions, from under whose iron sceptre they have never yet been able to deliver themselves. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 385 “ We may suppose an event, which we deprecate; nay, should we not be prepared for every possible issue of the present unprecedented divisions of- mankind, we have a right to be apprehensive of the abilities of our own managers, who are so afraid to depart from recedent, that, like men of detail, they may e inadequate to the task of preserving the vessel from shipwreck, now grappling with danger not only great, but new and uncommon. If the present ministry fail, who after them shall be trusted? It requires little peNnetration to see the anarchy and discord which will follow; it will be such, teh thing short of a general union ai people themselves, will be able to heals baste therefore to associate, at least to be to associate; if, then, such a broken state of things should take place, the civil broils that ane necessarily ensue, would soon subside before the united irresistible voice of the whole. Do not, I entreat you, hesitate’ thinking such a work premature as yet,— this is written in May 1793; but a month, and then it may be too late; a malignant party may be already formed, and only waiting for the halting of the present menagers; it will then be too late to seek to subject to deliberation, after a party has dared the act of rebellion. Jf you go po further than separate meetings in different towns, we will not be able to confide in yous con fraternity, because while in such a state you may be but the tools of a faction; we have all confidence and unite with all affection in one assembly of commissioners from all countries of the world. Gentlemen, observe that expressica ; this letter, in the beginning of it, speaking with reference to the war, does. not know but the palaces of ambition may be all overset; the illars will tumble with’ their supporters. Then it says, “ we could have all confidence and unite with all affection in one assembly commissioners from all countries of the world —if we knew they were chosen by the unbiassed voice of the people, because they would come up with the same disinterested views and desires as ourselves, having all to a common centre of union and interest; but we could not confide in fellowcitizens, who kept aloof from such union, and would not previously affiliate in one great and indivisible family. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 386 Gentlemen, I have befote told you, that there was a society at Birmingham. Upon the 10th of June 1793, the London Corresponding Society writes to that Society in these terms: “ it is with singular satisfaction the Committee of the London Corresponding Society received your letter; they are very giad to see the spirit of freedom springing up in Birmingham, and they make no doubt but that the zeal of your Society and the increase of your numbers will soon do away the stigma thrown on your town by the unjustifiable behaviour of a Church and King mob: ‘we are entirely of your opinion. with regard to the necessity of a general union, and we believe, as you do, that when once the country shall have so united,—what then? “ the Neroes of the day will be forced to yield to the an demand of a long and sore oppressed entlemen, the political societies at Norwich also write to the London Corresponding Society with respect to this Convention upon the 25th of June 1793, in which they say, “ we also received your friendly letter prior to that wherein you stated three propositions: first, a petition to his majesty, or to parliaament, or a national convention; and ordered one of our committee to answer it ; should be glad if you will inform me whether it was attended to.’ I gave my opinion on the subJect to the Constitutional Society of London, and found their ideas congenial to my own, —thatalludes to the letter they wrote him,—viz. an address to the king—futile; a petition to parliament (as a conquered people)— tolerable; a national convention GE crutenstances admitted), best of all. ‘Gentlemen, you will find that, upon the 28th of June 1793, whilst these societies were holding so much correspondence with y Tespect to thie national convention, as the only effectual mcans, it was thought an address to the nation should be prepared: that is not immaterial, because you will find afterwards, that the project of a national convention in Scotland was thought by many of the members of it, and many of the members of those bodies, to have failed for want of such a previous address to the nation; and upon this occasion two gentlemen are brought. together, I do not know whether one of them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 387 at that time was s member of the society or not, but two members are brought together, Mr. Horne Tooke and a borer of the name of Yorke, who, you will find, was a delegate ofto the convention in Scotland, and who you will find has acted a considerable other parts of this country, were to ployed in preparing that address. Upon the 6th of July 1793, a letter havin; been feceived from the political socintes de Norwich, theanswer, signed by the prisoner at the bar, is given in these terms':“Fellow-citizens, the London Cotresponding Society have received, and: read with pleasure, your letter of the 25th of Jane ;' bit the answer, which you mention to‘have been made to our three questions, has not by come to hand; we shall be glad to be i formed by your next whether it was ever ‘put in the post-office. i “ie 6 “With regard‘te the questions themselves, however individuals may have made up thelr mitids on them, the public seeincd most to approve the mode of petitioning parliament. Then it states the effect oF the petitions, ‘“ Exhorting you therefore to throw aside all unavailing complaint, we wish you to occupy yourselves in instructing the people, in intrdducing and maintaining order and regularifs in your own society, and in forming a junctio’ with all others associated for the same putpose throughout the nation, by keeping up’a constant correspondence with them; but, above all, orderly and courageously preparin yourself for the event,"—now mark the event,— “ for, as it is natural to suppose that those, who now pe on the public, will not willingly yield up their enjoyments, nor repossess us of our rights without a struggle, which by their be haviour in Ireland,—that alludes to the bill in Ireland to prevent a convention,—" wehave some reason to think they are meditating, and perhaps may intend to effect by means of those Joreign mercenaries, who ure now paid by the sweat of our brow, and whom, under some plausible pretence, it would be no difficult ! matter to land on our shore: it may be morepantageous to humanity to show them at firstthat their opponents are neither mob nor rabble, but an indignant oppressed people, in wham is not yet entirely extinct the valour of their foree fathers. . A e gentlemen, in a letter to Hertford, which is written by the same Correspending Society, upon the Sist of July 1793, and which Socie' at Hertford had desired to know their princt ples, they state themselves in the same manner; “ We receive with pleasure your assurance of co-operating with us fora reform in parliament, en object to which all our endeavours tend, and on which our hearts arp invariably fixed; but as your declaration that you will not pledge yourselves to demand universal suffrage and annual parliaments, is followed by no specific plan of reform of your another set; without affecting the vitals ad-sion in’ the ‘palaces “of verse to the system of reform, these might bedown, under the easily accomplished: but to cut up deep and supporters, we may. wide rooted prejudices, to give effectual energyand all dangerous to the dictates of truth in favour of publictabernacle of righ’ . virtue and national prosperity, in opposition tohimself be in it 0 ee..self and all its interested habits, and to with- gentlemen, theseare stand and overawe the final efforts of theto be understood. i powers of darkness, is the work of the whole,“ How hurtful to th and not ofa part ; a work to which mankinding mind, to look bac! —

Having thus unequivocally stated our principics, we shall conclude by observing, that the “Dill just passed in Ireland is of a nature to Bwaken the jealousy of every friend to freedom and humanity—will render every exertion justifiable, should a similar attack upon conBtitutional freedom be attempted here. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 405 ‘. In October 1798, the Scotch Convention having met, of which we have all of us heard 80 Touch out of this place, you will find that a etter had been received from a Mr. Sinclair, together with an address from Sirving who Was secretary to the Convention and Friends of the People in Scotland, by the London Constitutional Society; an extraordi meeting of the Society was therefore called, by the Crown and Anchor, to consider the wtility and propriety of sending delegates to a convention of delegates. of the different societies in Great Britain, at Edinburgh, for the purpose of obtaining a parliamentary reform. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 406 Upon the 28th of October 1798, this society came to a resolution to send delegates to that convention, and the two persons elected were Mr. Sinclair and Mr. Yorke; and perhaps one cannot state a more striking. instance of the extraordinary power of a small society, afflating itself with societies, spread all over the whole kingdom, than by stating that Sinclair, who was deputed from this society, meeti with other delegates in Scotland, bad no di culty of assuming with others the title of a delegate to the British Convention—to assert their right to do acts in contradiction to the legislature—than by telling you, that this Yorke and Sinclair were deputed from this society by a poll, in which he, who had the majority, had seventeen votes only; My. Yorke and Mr. Sinclair are accordingly scot down, and they go with all the delegation of the power of the people, which this Constitutional Society, thus affiliated, could give them, and what they thought it was you will see presently
ATTORNEYGENERAL 408 ‘gasp—one or two caurpaigns more will terminate its existence. “We are glad to see that you ‘begin to make a proper use of delegation; where 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 409 ‘bodies of men are too numerous to be convened easily on every occasion, delegation is 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 410 “the best, and indeed the only way to obtain the general opinion. Scotland, iniproving on the idea, have ot only summoned their tw delegates, but also invite those of every other society to attend a kind of convention (as if Mr. Hardy knew nothing about it), “ which is to be held at Edinburgh on the 29th instant, the enclosed paper, which I, previous to the communicating your letter to our committee (which will meet only to-morrow), make haste to tranemit to you, will show you that your society is included in the general invitation to send delegates to that peste which we exhort you to do. if you possibly can; I firmly believe our society will not miss the opportunity of doing the same. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 411 ‘Now you will find that, upon the 5th of October 1793, Hardy, who wrote this letter upon the 17th, wrote to Skirving in this way 2—“ With pleasure I peruse your favour of the 2ad instant, but, as yet, have scen nor heard nothing ‘of the two copies’ of Mr. Muir’s trial, which you mention as being sent to the society and to myself—be kind enough, notwithstanding, to return that gentleman thanks for his polite attention, and assure him that we view him in the light of a martyr to freedom, as well as Mr. Palmer, and that our warmest bh are, that the oppressors of mankind will either be ashamed or afraid of carrying their revengeful malice into executron 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 412 «The General Convettion, which you mention, appears to Mr. Margarot (to whom alone E have communicated your letter) and myself te be a very excellent measure, und as such, I cordd wish you, without delay, to communicate it officially to our society without any ways mentraning thut have written to me prisutely— if in your official letter you should sequire us 80 send a deputation to that meeting, I have no doubt tut our society would, with pleasure, accept the invitation ; andIain persuaded it may do much good
ATTORNEYGENERAL 414 You are right; itis true, that we ‘have hed another general meeting, at which a hastily composed and suddenly produced address to the king was read, applauded, and tobe presented ; but, on a cool revisal, the said address being found to be more 1iPnabired om spirited, more dengerous in its lan e, than advantageous in its object, feaider being too long, the committee, with the approbation of the majority of the society, have adopted anomuch safer, more apposite, relating solely to the war: enclosed you have a copy of it; but-you was misinformed when you was, told we passed any resolutions at that meeting, for we only came to one, and that rather of a private nature, namely, that the conduct of sir James Sanderson, in preventing ‘the meeting of the London’ Corresponding ‘Society, at. the Globe tavern, Fleet street, was of such’ a nature s to place him below our censure. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 415 Gentlemen, the London Constitutional -Society gave their delegates, Mr. Yorke and Mr. Sinclair, certain instructions: and I ought’ here to tell you, -by way of explaining the effect of whatam now to state, that the’ manner of ‘keeping the books of the London Constitutional Society, as I understand it, was this—The resolutions, made upon one night,’ were taken upon loose minutes, either by the’ secretary, or by other persons, who acted in his absence, or in his presence, when he was not. doing that duty himself: they were entered before the subsequent night of meeting, regularly. in the book, and the first thing done upon the' subsequent night of meeting was to read the’ resulutions which were made upon the former night, and to see that they were correct: now it will naturally occur that the minutes may explain the book, and the book may explain the minutes: now, when they come to drawthe minutes, which you will have for the insteuction of their delegates ata convention, which was to be held in Scotland, the first’ ided was, toinstruct those delegates, to petition parliament; but they seem to have recollected that that wasa measure, which had been’ abandoned some months before by all the societies with whom they were affiliated: they therefore struck out of their minutes the purpose of applying to parliament, and they send instructions in these words : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 416 “ The delegates are instructed, on the part of the society, ty assist in bringing forward and supporting any constitutional measures fer procuring a real representation of theCommons of Great Hritain in parliament— that, in specifying the redress to be demanded of existing abuses, the delegates ought never! to lose sight of the two essential principles, general suffrage and annual representation, together with the unalienable right in the poopie to reform, and that a reasonable and nown compensation ought to be made to‘ the representatives of the nation by a national contribution. What they meant by the representatives of the nation, after what I have already read to you, I think you cannot possibly mistake. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 417 London Correspanding Society are’ somewhat bolder in the instructions, which they send with their delegates to the convention in Scotland : you will find these instructions are to the following effect : By article the 1st, the delegate is instructed “ that he shallon no account depart from the original object and principle of this society; namely, the obtaining annua! parliaments, and universal suffrage, by rational and lawful means. 2d. To support the-opinions that representatives in parliament ought to be. paid by their constituents, : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 418 ““7th, That itis the duty of the people now, gentlemen, I beg your attention to this; it is the principle, upon which the convention in Scotland was formed, and upon which it acted: “ That it is the duty of the people to resist uny act of parliament, repugnant to the original principles of the constitution, as would be every attempt to prohibit associations for the purpose of reform. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 419 Gentlemen, there is no government in this country, if this principle is to be acted upon, because nobody can tell to what extent it will Bo and accordingly you will see that these lelegates, who went into Scotland, with this authority in their hands, carried the authotity far beyond the resistance, which they were authorized to make according to the principles t:ere laid down, and they state a preat variety of cases, all approved afterwards oth by the London Corresponding, and the Constitutional Society, in which the people, and the convention of the people, were to resist parliament. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 420 Gentlemen, these societies having sent delegates to the conyention in Scotland, I proceed now to state that the acts of that convention, to the extent at least to which the delegates from this country were authorized to act, are evidence against those who sent them and therefore against the persons here indicted. But farther, they communicated to the societies here, particularly to the prisoner at the bar, their acts; and the societies here, in distinct resolutions, acting upon consideration, approved their whole conduct: they therefure made that conduct of their delegates in the convention in Scotland, whether it was agrecable to the original authority which was given them, or not, their own; they adopted ut by giving it their subsequent approbation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 421 Gentlemen, you will find, first of all, that they received a letter from the Sheffield Society, athliating with them, in which it was Proposed to determine like Englishmen. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 422 After receiving a great deal of other correspondence, which I will not trouble you with reading, the societies here prepare to send delegates to Scotland. Mr. Skirving sent a circular letter upon the arrival of the English delegates to the delegates of all the associations in Scotland, which were extremely numerous, and very widely extended; and I think the delegates of these difterent societies came together to the number of one hundred and eighty. After sitting some time, Mr. Marrot, you will find, who was the delegate of the London Corresponding Society, represents to the body there met—“ That the societies in London were very numerous, though sometumes fluctuating ; that in some part of England whole towns are reformers: that in Sheffield and the environs there are fifty thousand ; that in Norwich there are thirty societies in one; that if they could get a convention of England and Scotlan , they might represent six or seven hundred thousand males, which is a majority of all the adults in the kingdom. — 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 423 You will find Mr. Margarot moves, that, previous to publishing an address to the public a committee should be appointed to consider the means, and draw up a plan of general union and co-operation—between what? Not between any societies in the two nations, but a plan of general union and co-operation between the two nations. In their constitutional parent of a theory of parliamentary reform, they stylejthemselvesa convention, and this, gentlemen, is extremely material for Pi to attend to; they style themeelves, “ The British Convention of the delegates of the people associated to obtain universal s and annual parliaments. Then I ask what is a convention of the people according to these societies? According to the proceedings in Scotland, a convention of the people is a convention of the delegates from s0cieties in England and Scotland. They assert that the people have in them all civil and political authority; and they, repeatedly, again and again, from the moment that this convention was formed in Scotland to the moment of its dispersion, more especially at the time of its dispersion, more especially still from the time of its dispersion tll the time of a meeting on the 20th of January, at the Globe tavern; and on the 27th of March, when another convention was proposed, as I stated at the outset, they repeatedly and in the most pressing terms state that now or never was the time, when the people were to meet, when they were to act by their own force, when they were courageously to prepare themselves for the event, and to show those whom they called their oppressors and plunderers, that they were a brave people, in whom valour was not extinct. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 424 Having thus met together, upon the principles of the French system, which took place on the 10th of. August 1792, they proceed directly to the French practices, which took place then in the National Assembly of France, took place then hecause the people of France were understood to be represented by aconvention ; these delegates taking upon themselves also to be aconvention of the people, they instituted Primary Societies, they divided the country into departments, they appointed provincial assemblies, they have Committees of Union, they thank for patriotic donations, they assume an epoch, they appoint a Secret Committee to be called together upon extraordinary emergencies; and upon the 28th of November 1793, they come toa resolution, to which I must beg your most serious attention. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 425 Gentlemen of the jury, you will remember that they went with authorities, which stated to them that it was the duty of the people, which people they had taken upon themselves to represent, to resist any act of parliament, that should be made for a parti purpose. It is hardly, I think, to be contended, that the pat bulk of the people of this country, ; ing wrongous imprisonment and against unppy in their political existence, as undoubtedly they are, remaining happy in their political existence, because they do not teel grievances (till they are taught by malignant industry to believe that they exist), I mean to such a degree as to call for measures of this sort, could believe that the legislature of the country, doing justice to the subjects, whoin it is bound to protect, would permit a proceeding of this kind to go on—yet, gentlemen, confiding su much as these persons did in the supposed state of their number-in that coun- ; try, and of those who were to be connected with them in this, you will find that, upon the 28th of November 1793, one of the persons belonging to that convention, citizen Sinclair, I think, the members all standing up upon their feet, for the greater solemnity of the thing, proposes this resolution— Resolved that the following declaration and resolutions be inserted at the end of our minutes—“ That this convention—now if it be possible to say that any convention means to act asa con- , yention of the people, it is that which sets itselfabove the legislature in the act it is doing —“ that this convention, considering the ca-lamitous consequences of any act of the legislature, which may tend to deprive the whole or any part of the people of their undoubted right to meet, either by themselves or by delegation, to discuss any matter relative to their common interest, whether of a public or private nature, and holding the same to be totally inconsistent with the first principles and safety of society, and also subversive of our known and acknowledged constitutional liberties
ATTORNEYGENERAL 427 Gentlemen, permit me to. call your attention to this, that this declaration, in its principles, follows the instructions that they had teceived, that, if any attempt was made to bring in a convention bill, they were then to doso and so. They then proceed thus—“ do declare before God and the world, that we shall tollow the wholesome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act, which shall militate against the constitution of our country’—That 1s saying, that the will of the legislature is not a better judge of what is an act against the constitution of the country, than the affiliated clubs at Edinburgh—“ and shall continue to assemble and consider of the best means by which we can accomplish a teal representation of the people, is that a parliament 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 429 “ And we do resolve that the first notice fiven—The first notice—parliament is not even to discuss the thing; but, if an intimation of it ismade in parliament—“ That the notice given for the introduction of a conYention bill, or any bill of a similar tendency to that passed in Ireland in the last session of their parliament, or any bill for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus act, or the act for preventdue delays in trials in North Britain, or in case of an invasion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 430 Gentlemen, I call back to your recollection the letter of Skirving—I call back to your recollection not only the letter of Skirving, but that the troops of liberty were promised to be sent with bayonets and pikes from that country, which at this moment was likely to invade us—“ or the admission of any foreign troops whatsoever, into Great Britain or Ire land—If the parliament of this country, for the purpose of protecting itself against that foreign invasion, had brought these foreign troops into Great Britain or Ireland, not being the troops of a nation with which we were at war, this convention of the people was to act upon the introduction of such foreign troops in the same manner as they would act in case of an invasion by those who were at war with us—What is the construction that follows upon that
ATTORNEYGENERAL 432 Gentlemen, are the parties tu this convention in Scotland such men, as would think of bringing themselves together to declare their sittings permanent upon such a gout as they state here, namely, the legislature of a great country acting in the execution of the great duties which belong to the legislature of that country, without supposing, by that solemn declaration, that they could make their meeting effectual by the acts which were to be carried on for the purpose of preventing that legislature from deliberating upon such duties? By what acts could it be done but by exertions, as they style them, in the manner of their forefathers, by force? By affiliated societies, exerting their physical strength that physical exertion, which Mr. Barlow observes is to be preceded or presided by spreading useful knowledge, and that useful knowledge, being that which is to beat down the existing authority of King, Lords, and Commons. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 433 “ The convention therefore resolve, that each delegate immediately on his return home do convene his constituents, and explain to them the necessity of electing a delegate or delegates, and of establishing a fund without delay, against any of these emergencies, for his or their expense, and that they do instruct the said delegate or delegates to hold themselves ready. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 434 Gentlemen, you see what they expected from the legislature—they knew that what they were doing ought to provoke the legisTature to do what they meant to forbid the legislature to do: and they instruct their delegate or delegates to hold themselves read: —“ to depart at one hour’s warning. Well ight Mr. Skirving say, that a month's delay, ged ile whole was lost : well might Mr. Hardy say, sie he ort in lettersabel produce presently, that i opportunity is lost now, it is lost for ever—we must act now, or we never can. Having some reason to suppose that this convention would be dispersed, they then with great solemnity come to another resolution : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 435 “ That the moment of any illegal dispersion of the British Convention shall be considered as a summons to the delegates to repair to the place of meeting appointed for the convention of emergency hy the Secret Committee, and that the Secret Committee be instructed without delay to proceed to fix the place of meeting. gentlemen, after these resolutions it became necessary to do a little more, that is, to declare upon what principles this conyeniee existed. Now mar ue inciples, and do your country justice; a Laren of the puarseliane tae Thave mate to you, as are worthy your attention, to what I have beture stated as the necessary connexion between the principle and practice of Mr. Paine, and of these societies. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 436 Gentlemen, these principles brought together the French Convention—what is the ractice then, that flows-out of the principle? hy, it is the assembling of a convention upon principles obliging it to sit for the purpose of declaring that the eeilelne shall do nothing but what they liked: that is to all intents and purposes a National Convention ; if not a convention for an eternal reform, at least a convention, that probibits the legislature to do any thing but what is agreeable to them. Then having met for the execution of the practice, they proceed immediately to the declaration of the principle—but they do not proceed to a declaration of the principle, till they have done that strong and solemn act, which I have stated: then they resolve “ that acommittee be appointed to draw up a declaration’—This is France exactly—It is the Southwark Society in 1792—“ a declaration of the natural imprescriptible rights of man, and that the same be prefixed to an address to the people of Great Britain. That a committee of observation, that is, for the better effectuating the purpose that they had before declared, ““be appointed in London to give the earliest intimation of any motion of the kind mentioned in the foregoing resolutions to the different societies. You will then find that they met in a place, which they call Convention Hall, under the wt name of the British Convention, and then they are informed that the London Corresponding Society would undertake tobe that committee of observation, which, they say, ought to exist —and then you will find that the members mentioned that they had thousands of their constituents in London, Sheffield, Norwich, eds, &c. and that the convention was to look at itself as in its true nature a Committee of the people—that therefore it was necessary to have, as they have in France Primary Societies, who shall be consulted—in other words, that this committee of the pores Edinburgh, which was to overrule the ogi lature, was itself to be overruled by these Primary Societies, these primary societies themselves being overruled by the leaders of the great clubs, from which they emanated, and so forming in this country a government, under the power of a Jacobin Club, and that ereounen destroying the present existing legislature of the kingdom. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 437 You will also find that, before these persons parted, Mr. Margarot communicated to his constituents the proceedings of this body, which he styles always the Convention of t People associated to obtain annual parliaments and universal suffrage. There are letters which I shall lay before you, without detailing them, stating that they looked up to the London Corresponding Society, and the Society for Constitutional Information— that their active exertions were necessary for the accomplishing the projects, which the: sitting in Edinburgh were to execute; aad then the two delegates of the London Corresponding Society write to Mr. Hardy, as the secretary of that society, an account of their proceedings—they give him an account of that solemn motion, and of the manner of making it, which I have just been detailing to you—they state to him that they had determined to assemble in convention in any such case— that the appointment of the place, which is a circumstance I beg your most serious attention to, was left to a Secret Committee; but then they send to him an account of the motion, infurming him in the letter—that “letters convey but very imperfectly, and with no great degree of safety, what we might wish to inform each other of. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 438 Now what do you think it is that they do not inform him of in this letter
ATTORNEYGENERAL 440 This Secret Committee having been apinted in the Scotch Convention, the fact ing communicated to the London Corresponding Society by their delegates, you willlikewise find that Mr. Sinclair, the delegate from the Constitutional Society to the Society at Edinburgh, was not behindhand in the communication of it: he communicates the proceedings, and desires that a secret committee may be appointed in that society. It was not long after this, that the wisely exerted power of the magistracy of that country dispersed that convention. The dispersion of that convention, which, from what I have before stated to you, was conceived to bea body that must then do its work, or its work never would be done, suggested to the societies of this country the necessity of undering the same business, of undertaking it at the same hazard, knowing that the project must either then be accomplished, or that it never could thereafter be attempted—for that no government could permit such a convention as this to meet, when its nature was teally understood, without taking some means to protect itself against the consequences of the existence of such a convention. Gentlemen, you will therefore find, that, after they had been dispersed, and aftcr, in consequence of that dispersion, some of them had been punished in Scotland, by sentences which were pronounced upon offences, not stated in the records of that court in so aggravated a way against them as they might, in my humble opinion, have been stated, that it became ni that some step should be taken immediately to prevent the mischief ich was meditated; for you will find, in the evidence, propositions in these societies about a rescue, which failed; but Pe: will find in their correspondence from Scotland, and their correspondence from those ships in which the members of the Scotch Convention were before they sailed in execution of their sentences, not only the strongest invitations to do some strong acts in this country, to both societies, but, on the other hand, the strongest and most unequivocal declarations pee societies, that these strong acts must ne. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 441 Gentlemen, you will find that before they left Scotland, upon the 11th of December, 1793, there is a letter from Mr. Margarot to Mr. Hardy to this effect—“ We received your letter and remittance yesterday, and shall be glad to receive another such without delay. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 442 “ The convention you will see has declared Nself permanent; they are to sit jn some other part of the country, which is not yet 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 443 Gentlemen, Mr. Sinclair, the delegate of the Constitutional Society, came to London. Ihave before observed to you, from a letter of Gerrald and Margarot, that there were some things that could not safely be conveyed by letter. Margarot writes a letter from Edinburgh to the ‘prisoner, in which he says —“ My colleague, Gerrald, also proposes to leave place the latter end of this, or the beginning of the next week: he will expleia himself to you: Pray send him ‘money for this journey, &c. He is now gone to Perth on very urgent business. Since Sinclair's departure nothing new has occurred, except the formation of a society somewhere about the Grampian Hills’—this shows the spirit of fraternization—“ they have already made a subscription towards it: again we are interrupted, and likely tu lose the post, unless I dispatch this immediately. ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 444 Upon the 22d of December 1793, another letter is written to Mr. Hardy by the same gentleman, which probably led in some degree, to the transactions that I have to state as having passed in January 1794; for, after stating what had happened to himself ip Scotland, he says— Sheffield has on this occasion exhibited a most manly spirit’ — The Sheffield Society had at that time sent out some excessively strong resolutions, which I shall give you in evidence in. the course of this business—“ I am extremely mortified to find so great a difference between them and the London Corresponding Society ; itis not however too late. For God's make send forth some very strong resolutions, and above all, talk of impeachments, and of petitioning the king to remove from their offices those persons who have thus violated the laws of the realm. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 445 You will find from a letter of the 24th of December, that spp ales a delegate of the London Society, a delegate of Norwich, and a Mr. Brown, who was the delegate from Sheffield, had gone to attend a general meeting of the Society of the Friends of Freedom in'East Lothian, and then the expression isThe time is come that we must show ourselves worthy of liberty, or deservedly lose it. The opposition of our adversaries is demonstration of the propriety and efficacy of the means which we have employed to obtain it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 446 Upon the 27th of December 1793, a will find Mr. Margarot states that Mr. Gerrald was gone to Perth; that he himself had been in t Lothian ; that they had been well employed; that they must send out spirited resolutions; and you will find, that, upon the 11th of January 1794, Mr. Hardy writes a letter to Norwich relative to the proceedings I have now been stating, the Constitutional Society first, and the London Corresponding Society afterwards, peving in their public acts approved every thing that this convention had done. Mr. Hardy’s letter runs thus: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 447 I have just received a letter from citizen Margarot, at Edinburgh, with some of the Edinburgh Gazetteers, where you will see that citizen Skirving is found guilty, and sentenced for fourteen years transportation to Botany Bay. Margarot’s trial comes next; he meets it with great firmness and resolution. I have no time to make m comments on the proceedings, but I thi our opponents are cutting their. own throats 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 448 ‘| as fast as they can—Now is the time for us to do something worthy of men: the brave deSenders of liberty, south of the English channel, are performing wonders, driving their enemies before them like chaff before the whirlwind. Margarot tells me that he has not time to write to you just now, but he hopes to have time very soon, when his trial is over, and immured in a prison. The London Corres‘ponding Society is to have a general meeting, and an anniversary dinner on Monday the 20th instant, at the Globe tavern, Strand. Gentlemen, you will find that Mr. Margarot, this delegate, with whom Mr. Hardy is thus in correspondence, writes to the Norwich United Societies—“ This morning ten ships of war have left Spithead for the channel; and it is here reported, that the Brest fleet is out. Rumour, always magnifying things, says there are seventy sail of the French at sea; if so, there must be a number of transports among them, and a descent may probably be the consequence—for God's whe: my worthy friends, do not relax in the cause of freedom.—Now what connexion had a descent with the cause of freedom
ATTORNEYGENERAL 450 ‘the proceedings of the year 1794, as far as ithey depend upon written evidence; and it must be a satisfaction to the mind of every man who hears me, that, in the course of this business, whatever observations may arise upon the parol eyidence that will be 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 451 “given you, I think ‘you will find so strong a confirmation of all you are to hear in the written evidence that is to be laid before you, ‘that these observations cannot possibly mislead you from coming to the true conclusion upon the whole of the evidence, whatever that may be. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 452 Gentlemen,. the Constitutional Society, having sent their delegate to the Scotch Con‘vention, you will find that, ata meeting of “the 17th of January 1794, the following reso‘lutions were come to, to which I must desire your particular attention, more especially as there are some circumstances belonging to the composition of those resolutions, which appear to me to be worthy of attention. I have before told you that these resolutions “were usually drawn from minutes—the original minutes still exist, and perhaps they show that discretion, with which men are sometimes able to state, in different ways, precisely the same thing: I say, that these Tesolutions of the 17th of January 1794, were meant to excite the subjects of this country to resistance. co 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 453 “ Resolved, That law ceases to be an object of obedience, whenever it becomes an instrument of oppression. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 454 “ Resolved, That we recall to mind, with the infamous Jefferies, once lord chief justice of England, who, at the era of the glorious revolution, for the many iniquitous sentences which he had passed, was torn to pieces by a brave and injured people. This 1s applied to the judges of Scotland, who executed the law upon such facts as I have been stating —“ That those who imitate his example deserve his fate—this sort of intimation might have a tendency, I hope it had not, to put in any peril those who did, in the regular course, and in the due course, of their judicial duties, pass those sentences, to which these resolutions allude. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 455 “ That the Tweed, though it may divide countries, ought not, and does not, make a separation between those principles of com‘mon severity in which Englishmen and Scotchmen are equally interested; that injustice in Scotland is-injustice in England; and that the safety of Englishmen is endangered, whenever their brethren in Scotland, for a conduct ‘which entitles them to the approbation ofall wise, and the support of all brave men, are sentenced to Botany Bay, a punishment hitherto intlicted only on felons. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 456 hat we see with regret, but we see without fear, that the period is fast approacliing when the liberties of Britons—this was in January—“ must depend, not upon reason, to which they have long appealed, nor on their powers of expressing it, but on theirfirm and undaunted resolution to ‘oppose tyranny by the same means by which it is exercised. Now what is thetyranny? The exercise of the regular government of the country. What is the means by which it is exercised? The application of the force of the country in support of the government of the country. What is this resolution then? Why, that the means which the government takes in the regular exercise of its functions, ought now to be resisted— We see it with regret, but do not see it with any fear. That a breach of allegiance was contemplated you can have no doubt, for you will see in the original of this that it stood thusthat, “ as allegiance and protection are reciprocal, law ccuses to be an object of obedience, wherever it becomes an instrument of eppressian Cae that, as it stood originally, with the third resolution, and whatait? Why, it is—that the protection, which was due from Kim to whom allegiance is due, has not been afforded: therefore allegiance is no longer due. “ We see with regret, but we see without fear, that the period is fast approaching, when the liberties of Britons must depend, not upon reason, to which they have long appealed, nor on their powers of expresing it, but on-their firm ard undaunted resolution to oppose tyranny by the same means by which it is exercised. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 457 You will also find that it stood, “that lishmen feel the oppression of Scotehmen, which they are determined to resist at the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 458 ‘fhe deepest satisfaction, the merited fate ofhazard of their lives,"—You will find the lass resolution, in the minates, comparing the gebuine representatives of this country, in the House of Commons, with this convention in Scotland, which convention in Scotland had taken upon itself to resolve upon resistance to even a motion, in either House of Parliament of this country, in the execution of their duty, thus : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 459 hat we approve of the conduct of the British Convention, who, though assailed by force, have not been answered by arguments, and who, unlike the members of a certain assembly, have no interest distinct from the common body of the peuple—The words originally e008 who “ being the incorrupt representatives of many thousands, have spoken thege of truth and firmness. Can I make this court the instrument of conveying to the public, what I cenfess I do most anxiously wish to make it the instrument of conveying to the public, as far as it is fit, in the execution of the duty that I am now discharging, that they may understand what it is that men, when they are scattering these libels through the country, mean—“ this convention, assailed by force, have not been answered by arguments—How was it possible to answer those by arguments, who were comting to solemn and sacred resolutions, which they did not even dare to put upon the face of their own minutes? How were we to answer those by ment, who were working under ground till they had blown up the government, and then say, you cannot point out that we have been acting ill, because we will not tell you how we have been acting ? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 460 Upon the 16th, Mr. Margarot writes again, leaving them to pursue what sort of conduct they please. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 461 Then there is a letter of some importance of the 28th of January, which is written to the person who stands at the bar—“ We have justreceived notice from the sheriff to hold ourselves nenly We depart at an hour's warning: we night; we imagine to Newgate; Look out for us. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 462 Gentlemen, you will likewise find a letter from Mr. Margarot to Mr. Hardy, of great consequence, as it explains many of the passages im the evidence between the 20th of January 1704, and the time that those persons were apprehended. Margarot writes from Edinburgh in this manner : “ armed associations are, I ewe, now set on foot by the rich; wherefore should not the poor do the same? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 463 “ Are you to wait patiently till twenty thousand Hessians and Hanoverians come to cut your throats? And will you stretch forth your necks like lambs to the butcher’s knife, and, like lambs, content yourselves with bleating? Pray let me hear from you soon. Remember me to Moffat, Muir, and Palmer, and all suffering brethren. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 464 Gentlemen, upon the 20th of January 1794, there was a meeting at the Globe tavern; that meeting, which, you will permit me to observe, Hardy mentioned in his letter of the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 465 11th of January 1794, which I before have spoken of, when he said the London Corresponding Society were to have a general meeting, and an anniversary dinner. Gentlemen, the proceedings of that day will des serve your very particular attention. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 466 “ Ata general meeting of the London Cor. responding Society, held at the Globe tavern, Strand, on Monday the 20th day of January 1794, citizen John Martin in the chair,— when I state this to you, I ought to say that I shall prove the prisoner to have been present, or to have been connected with all the transactions that I have been stating—“ the following address to the people of Great Britain and Ireland, was read and agreed to : citizens, We find the nation involved in a war, by which, in the course of one campaign, immense numbers of our countrymen have been slaughtered ; a vast expense has been incurred; our trade, commerce, and manufactories are almost destroyed ; and many of our ma nufacturers and artists are ruined, and their families starving. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 467 o add to our affliction, we have reason to expect that other taxes will soon be adied to the intolerable load of imposts and impositions, with which we are already overwhelm ed, for the purpose of defraying the expenses which have been incurred in a fruitless cresade, to re-establish the odious despotism of France. Co 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 468 “ When we contemplate the principles of this war, we confess ourselves to be unable to approve of it as a measure either of justice or discretion; and, if we are to form our calcu lation of the result, from what has already passed, we can only look forward to defeat, and the eternal disgrace of the British name. While we are thus engaged in an expen sive and ruinous foreign war, our state at home is not less deplorable. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 469  We are every day told by those persone who are interested in aap ns the corruption list, and an innumerable host of sinecure placemen, that the constitution of England is the perfection of human wisdom; that our laws (we should rather say their laws) are the perfection of justice; and that their administration of those laws is so impartial and so Teady, a3 to afford an equal remedy both to the rich and to the poor, by means of which we are said to be placed in a state of absolute freedom. The paper then goes on and reasons upon the state of the law in this country, under an exposition of Magna Charta, which gives as nearly the true meaning of it as man would give, who had never seen it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 470 “Jf we look to Ireland, we find that aeknowledged privilege of the people to mect for the support and protection of their rights and liberties, is attempted by terror to be taken away, by a late mfamous act of parliament
ATTORNEYGENERAL 472 “In Scotland, the wicked hand of power has been impudently exerted without even the wretched formality of an act of parliament
ATTORNEYGENERAL 474 “ The wisdonr and good conduct of the British Convention in Edinburgh has been such, as to defy their bitterest enemies to name the law which they bave broken; notwithstanding which, their papers have been seized and made use of as evidence against them, and many virtuous and meritorious individuals have been, as cruelly as unjustly, for their virtuous actions, disgraced and destroyed by infamous and illegal sentences of transportation; and these unjust and wicked judgments have been-executed with a rancour -and malignity never before known in this land; our respectable and beloved fellow Citizens have been cast fettered into dungeons, amongst felons in the hulks, to which they were not sentenced. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 475 “Citizens, we all approve the sentiments, ‘and are daily repeating the words for which these our respectable and valuable brethren are thus, unjustly and inhumanly, suffering ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 476 we do associate—mark the expression—“ in order to obtain a fair, free, and full representation of the people in a house of real national representatives
ATTORNEYGENERAL 478 ‘with societies in England; and that, in that state of affiliation and association, holding a convention, as they call it, of the people, from delegates of these societies, and not el the people—to do what 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 480 Gentlemen, recollect the expressions that Tread to yeu from Skirving’s letter: “ will you wait till barracks are erected in every village, and till subsidized Hessians and Hanoverians are upon us? You will now see from the proceedings I am stating to you, that the time was come, that they were not only virtuous but courageous enough to do an act, which in 1792 and 1793, though they were virtuous enough to do, they were not cow rageous enough to do. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 481 “ You may ask. perhaps, by what means shall we seek redress? We answer, that men in a state of civilized society, are bound to seek redress of the grievances from the laws, as long as any redress can be obtained by the laws; but our common master, whom we serve (whose law is a law of liberty, and whose service is perfect freedom), has taught us not to expect to gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles: we must have redress Jrom our own laws. —Were they to be a convention of the people, then, without making laws? They approve the whole conduct of the British Convention, that would not let others make laws, and yet were they not to make laws? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 482 “ We must have redress from our own laws, and not from other laws; the laws of Great Britain are thus described,—“ the laws of our plunderers, enemies, and oppressors : indeed, if the legislature of their country were their plunderers, enemies, and oppressors, in their Notions, it would be very difficult to suppose, that they were to have redress from the laws of that legislature; but then it follo of course, that they meant to have reiress Ronn laws made by some other body, that had authority to make laws: and what that other bodyis, but the Convention which they determine upon must be left for those to say, who can find it out. They go on then to say, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 483 ‘“ There is no redress for a nation circumstanced as we are, but in a fair, free, and ful representation of the people
ATTORNEYGENERAL 485 Then follows a resolution that will require likewise your very particular attention : “ Resolved, That during the ensuing session of parliament the general committee of this society do meet daily, for the purpose of watching the proceedings of the parliament and of the administration of the government of this country. This was to be published: they do not therefore venture to insert totidem verbis that resolution, which I have stated to you was so solemnly made, and so sacredly sworn to in the Scotch Convention, but they resolve “ that upon the first introduction of any bill or motion inimical to the liberties of the peole, such as for landing foreign troops in Great ritain or Ireland, for suspending the Habeas Corpus act, for proclaiming martial law, or for preventing the people from meeting in societies for constitutional information — What the meaning of the term constitutional is we can judge by this time—that uponany express motion of this nature, “or any other innovation o «a similar nature ; that on any of these emergencies the general committee shall issue summonses to the delegates of each division, and also to the secretaries of the different societies affiliated and corresponding with-this society, forthwith to calla eae caecalin of the people, to be held at such place, and in such a manner, as shall be specified in the sammons, for the purpose of taking such measures into their consideration. They omit the case of invasion in this publication. But what is this, supposing nothing had passed in Scotland of what I have stated to you? What! Is the legislature, is the rule and government in this great country reduced to this state, that it shall ind no protection in the administration of the law of the country against ns, associating and affiliating themselves x the purposes which they declare here? Is no motion to be made in parliament for amy purpose, which these societies choose to comprehend under the terms “ any other innevation, without explaining what it means
ATTORNEYGENERAL 487 Now, do they canvene the-people? In faet, it will be said, nothing like it. t they cali themselves a convention of the people in the very terms that they use. the summonses are to go to the delegates of each meeting, and also the secretaries of the different societies corresponding with this society, and no where else. For what purpose? ‘To call a general convention of the people! Then, what w the meaning of all that, taking it with its context? It is thise from your laws—the laws of you, our plunderers, enemies, and oppressors—we can expect no relief: we do not mean to come to you fur any: but we will watch you, and if you dare to propose an innovation of any sort, we shall call a fain, Sree, and full representation of the people. Composed pray how? By delegates from our societies, to seek, as a general convention of the People, redress from our own laws. It appears to me that the reasoning upon this paper 1s so whole and intire, that it is out of power of human ingenuity to touch it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 488 Then they resolve, “ That a hundred thousand copies of the Address to the people of Great Britain and Ireland shall be printed. Then they follow this up with the publication of a great many toasts ; and really, when one mentions such a thing as toasts in the trial of a greatnational cause, such as this undoubtedly is, one is afraid of its sinking into insignificance ; and yet this is a great feature in this cause. You will find that previously to one ofthe most seditious meetings which was ever held in this country, it was thought of importance enough that they should meet once, twice, or thrice, in committees, in arder to frame toasts, which were best calculated to inflame their minds, and to urge those forward who were already engaged in these projects, “ The Rights of Man: “ The British Convention ;—“ Success to the arms of freedom, against whomsoever directed. This is during the war—against whom were the armsof freedom directed, in the opinion of these persons? You remember they said that “ the elector of Hanover may join his troops to traitors and robbers; but the king of Great Britain will do well to remember that this country is not. Hanover: should he forget the distinction, we will not. They corresponded with the French in October; and in November 1792, they state to you, that the principles of their resolutions are those upon which they meant to act—that Great Britain was now engaged in a war—which they mmned—in which the arms of freedom, as ghey said, had never been engaged on the part of Great Britain. Then the meaning of the toast is obvieus, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 489 Another toast was—“ The virtuous and spirited citizens now in confinement for matters of opinion. Now, these matters of opinion are acts all done in the long tissue and detail of aconspiracy to subvert the monarchical government of this country, under its present legal provisions and limitations. The name of Mr. Frost being mentioned— I'mean him no disrespect in saying this—but it is tothe purpose of this business to take Notice of it—that gentleman was prosecuted in this country for this doctrine—“ No king, none in England, I am for liberty and equality every where. What was the consequence of that? The judgment of the law of England upon him was, that he was guilty of an offence: he was punished: he has suffered that punishment, and made an atonement to the Jaw: but these gentlemen, who sent Mr. Frost with Mr. Barlow, to state such doctrine to France, and br:ng such doctrine baek from France, you will find that they havea formal resolution that they will sustain this Mr. Frost in all his persecutions and prosecutions. Docs that mean nothing? If Mr. Frost is perseeuted for holding doctrines in the country, which were to put the king out of the system, is it no evidence of intention with respect to those who engaged in such projects jas I have mentioned, that they do come to a resolution, in which they declare that the law, questioning the propriety of declarations of that kind amounts toa persecution, and that he ought to be sustained against it? Gentlemen, you will bear from witnesses, who were present, what the proceedings on the 20th of January, and the general com’ plexion and nature of them were. Mr. Martin being in the chair, and Mr. Hardy being present, who wasa member of both these societies, an attending member in both of them, I will give you Martin’s account of the proceeding on the 22d of January 1794, in a letter in bis own hand-writing, sent to MauTice Margarot, at Edinburgh, who bad advised you will recollect, the London Corresponding Society to come to sume strong resolutions— who had urged that now is the time, that two months in Scotland would do the business, provided they did their duty in England. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 490 “ My dear sir, I dare say you think I have forgot you from my not having written to You, but you know my sentiments so well that it ‘was unnecessary for me, and would probably have been improper to say much on the subject of your mission’—then he states something about private business. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 491 “We had a meeting on Monday, I was in the chair—the newspaper gives our numbers at 500, but we were nearer 1,500: every thing was well conducted, that is to say regularly, and the proceedings were tolerably bold. Mr. Hardy, dare say, has sent you a copy of the address and resolution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 492 “ Your conduct receives universal approbation; and though I at one time dreaded the who opposed the subscription at first, are now putting their hands to the very bottom of their pockets, and swear by God you shall be supported with the last guinea—we must have another general meeting in a chapel, or some large place, and declare the purpose of a subscription, and I think we shall get plenty of the needful:for that and other purposes. Have you read my letter to ? do you incline to try the writ of error? what do the Scotch lawyers think of it, and what do you think of the legal knowledge of my countrymen? I firmly believe that the law is the only science, of which they know nothing. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 493 he king went yesterday to meet Ais parliament’—so now we have got no parliament of ours, the people of this country —“ they sat till six o’clock this morning: the papers are not out, but I am told only twelve members were for peace: I am glad the minister has so great a majority within doors for the war, and that the people have a greater majority without doors against the war: the swinish rogues had the impudence to write ‘ No war’ on all the doors and corners of the Houses of Lords and Commons, and they had even the audacity to groan and hiss, while his most sacred majesty was passing to and from the House —nay told, a woman, moved and seduced by the instigation of the devil, and traitorously intending, &c. did in St. James's Park take off her patten, and threw it with all her force at his majesty, whereby the glass of the state coach was broken, and his majesty putin fear: God save the king, for if, &c
ATTORNEYGENERAL 495 “ The society is increasing rapidly, both in spirit and in numbers, and the richnow begin to come among us, and to sit down with pleasure among the honest men with the leathern aprons. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 496 I could write to you strange things, but I know not but this may be read by somebody before it comes to your hands. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 497 Gentlemen, after this had passed, you will find that that letter was written by the Corresponding Society to the Society tor Constie tutional Informatiton (which I first mentioned to you) upon the 27th of March 1794, and now with your leave, I will read a part of .it to you again. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 498 “ I am directed by the London Correspond ing Socicty to transmit the following resolutions to the society for Constitutional Information. I should tell you first, in the order of time, that the society for Constitutional Information distinctly adopt that paper of the London Corresponding Society of the 20th of January 1794, as their own, and order it to be entered upon their books; they approve of the manly sentiments of it, and they fully take it to themselves, to all intents and purposes, as if it had been a conjunct meeting of them both. Then, the London Corresponding Society having held this- language respecting the convention, and upon the 24th of J. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 499 want of money, yet that is now over: those, the Constitutional Society having adopted the project of a convention stated in the address of the London Corresponding Society of the 20th, and the nature of that convention being acopvention from the atftiliated societies, to take upon themselves the character of a conpention of the people, it would be surprising indeed ifthe convention, which they speak of on the 27th of March, should be a convention of a different nature from that which they had both agreed to on the 20th and 24th of January—and with that observation I come again to this letter of the 27th of March. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 500 am directed by the London Corresponding Society to transmit the following resolutione tu the Society for Constitutional Information, and to request the sentiments of that society respecting the important measures which the present juncture of affairs seems to require. ‘The London Corresponding Society eonceives that the moment is arrived throughout the years 1791, 1792, and 1793, they thought it was not arrived—“ when a full and explicitdeclaration is necessary from all the friends of treedom—whether the late illegal and unheard-of prosecutions and sentences shall determine us to abandon our cause, or shall excite us to pursue a radical reform, with an ardour proportioned to the magnitude of the object, and with a zeal as distinguished on our parts, as the treachery of others in the same glorivus cause is notorious. The society for Constitutional Information is therefore required to determine whether or no they will be ready, when called upon, to act in conjunction with this and other societies, to obtain a tair representation of the people, whether they concur with us in seeing the necessity of a speedy convention for the purpose of obtaining, in a constitutional and legal method, a redress of those grievances under which we at present labour. Now, in the first place, with respect to the words “constitutional and legal method, ‘these persons have not much to claim upon the score of the effect and force of the words constitutional and legal method, which appear, through all their transactions of the years 1792 and 1793, and more particularly through the transactions of 1793, as they appy to the British Convention, in Scotland, to thought consistent with the existence of a eonvention of such a character as that had; and, if it was their purpose to have a convention of the people, by summonses to affiliated societies, that convention to take upon itself the power of the people, it is in vain that they talk of legal and constitutional methods : it is in vain, if the thing they mean to do, and the manner of doing it, is not legal or constitutional —Upon this letter, I apprehend, after what has passed, there can be no doubt what is meant bya convention: but it is not left there: for in the third resolution they state, that “there ought to be immediately 4 convention of the people by delegates—mark the words—“ deputed for that purpose from the aifferent societies of the friends of freedom, assembled in the various parts of this nation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 501 Then here is a convention of the same character, of the same name, and the same constitution, as that mentioned in the resolution of the 20th of January 1794. Now, to whom is this proposed? It is proposed to that Constitutional Society, which had adopted the address of the 20th of January 1794, and which had also said, by approving that address, that they were of opinion that redress was not to be obtained by the laws of England, but that they were to have redress against their oppressors, plunderers, and enemies, by their own laws—by that sort of representation of the people, which is formed by aconvention of the people, summoned from those associated societies. Then what follows upon it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 503 Gentlemen, when I lay this evidence before you, if I stopped here, I should be glad to learn why this is not a step taken for the execution of such a purpose as I have before stated—a step taken for constituting a body, or a step taken towards devising the means of constituting a body which was, lke the convention mentioned in the speech of Barrere, to supersede the legislature, to depose the king, to suffer him to have no existence, but what their good will and pleasure would allow him, against the will, as the language of the indictment states it, and im defiance of the authority of the parliament—to depose the king—for, if these people have the sovereign power, and they must have the sovereign power upon their own principles—the king of England cannot have it in the manner in which it is vested in him now. He was bound to resist such a projectas this: he owed it to every good subject in his country to resist it— he was sworn to do it by the solemn obligation of his coronation oath—you cannot therefore contemplate a case of his acting otherwise—the king being bound to resistance for the security of the subject, and fur the sake of observing his oath, for the sake of continuing to reign according to the terms of that oath, according to the statutes acreed upon in parliament assembled, and the laws and customs of the same. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 504 But, gentlemen, I do not stop here: you will also that there was a mecting at 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 505 Chalk Farm, the particulars of which I will Not state farther than to say, that, when they arg read, you will see that that meeting at Chalk Farm was a step taken in the farther prosecution of the functions of that committee of co-operation—that it was a measure taken for the express purpose of trying the temper of the people, of seeing what they could do by numbers. That meeting was held in April 1794, and it is very remarkable that it appears that there were meetings in other parts of this kingdom ; more particularly it appears from a letter, found in the possession of this prisoner, baa a there was a meeting in the open air at Chalk Farm, so there were meetings elsewhere —it required vigilance—it required the interposition of some strong hand, by parliament or otherwise, to preserve you in the situation in which you now are: if it be the will of these persons that you shall not remain in it, it is at least the duty of those, who are to watch over the country as long as it can exist, that it shall not be destroyed by any fault of theirs: but you will find there were meetings in the open air at Leeds, Wakefield, Huddersfield, Bradford, Birstal, and at various other laces. This project of a convention had en communicated to many parts of the country, and too many of them had assented to it; not only assented to it, but it will be proved, that the prisoner sent a circular letter to the remotest parts of this kingdom (which I willnow read), for the purpose of assembling this convention, for the perpore of carrying into effect the project of this British Convention, the body of which had been dissipated, but which was still carrying on its purposes b measures precisely the same as those whic! had exist in this part of the island. You will find that the prisoner writes this circular letter to all those societies; and the addressing this circular letter to all the societies, shows that the convention that was to be called was not to be a convention of the people at large, but a convention of delegates summoned from those societies, to usurp the character of “ a convention of the people. — “ The critical moment is arrived—mark the difference of language; in 1793 the time is not yet come, men are not virtuous nor courageous enough ; in 1792 they expected nothing from parliament; in 1793, they expected every thing from the societies in due time; and now they assert that the due time is come, that the Sulness of time is come—“ the critical moment “6 arrived, and Britons must either assert with zeal and firmness their claims to liberty, ‘or yield without resistance to the chains that ministerial usurpation is forging for them. Will you co-operate with us in the only peaceable measure—a very peaceable measure a convention of this sort!—“ that now presents itself with any prospect of success? We need not intimate to you, that, notwithstanding the unparalleled audacity of a corrupt and overbearing faction—now this corrupt and overbearing faction is the King, Lords, and Gommons of Great Britain—“ which at present earnest on the rights and liberties of the people; our peeing cannot in England be interrupted without the previous adoption of a convention bill. A convention bill !—this shows the reason for their resolutions in Scotland about permanent sittings, and the meeting of another British Convention, and for their language, which they held upon the. 20th of January 1794; “a measure it is our duty to anticipate’—mark these words—“ our duty to anticipate, that the ties of union may be more firmly drawn, and the sentiments and views of the different societies throughout the nation be com "—What was their object in this circular letter? If, when the British Convention in Edinburgh sat, there had been a motion for a convention bill in the parliament of Great Britain, why, their object was then, we perceive, that of being ready at an hour’s warning; communicating in ali parts of the kingdom to their delegates that solemn resolution, which had been made im the British Convention upon the 6th of November; they were instantly, before the project of such a bill could in parliament ripen out of notice of a motion into a bill once read, to be assembled in Edinburgh to prevent any such bill passing; they solemnl vowed to each other, hand in hand, and stan ing up, to give the greater solemnity to the declaration, “ that the moment such a bill as that was introduced into parliament, they would resist it at the hazard of their lives. Then what did they mean in this circular letter ? they meant that, while as yet the bare expectation of a convention bill might exist, while, as yet, no notice of such a motion was given or heard of in parliament—that it was their duty to anticipate what parliament might possibly think of. How to anticipate it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 507 The loprothaetion of sick men e this eountry for the humane purpose of giving them that air, which they could not obtain while on board a ship, is made the pretext of this letter for stating that “Hessians and Austrians are already among us, and, if we tamely submit, a cloud of these armed barbarians may be pace inupon us. Let us form then another British Convention. What was that convention? they expressly state it to be convention of the people, and a convention, which is to assume controlling powers over the legislature. “‘ We have a central situation io our view, which we believe would be most convenient for the whole island, but which we forbear to mention (entreating your confidence in this particular) till we have the answer of—whom 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 509 Gentlemen, this will be proved to you to have travelled as far as Strathaven, to have been received there, and delegates to have been appointed in consequence of the solicitation ; and then, as in the British Convention, in the month of November 1793, this great project of calling together a body, which was to put an end finally to the existence of parliament, was to be conducted by a secret committee ; because its operations, its assembling, and the means which were to be taken for it, could not be committed to numbers, a secret committee was then appointed. This letter ends—“ for the management of this business we have sppomnied a secret committee: you will judge how far it is necessary for you to do thesame. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 510 Gentlemen, the next proceedings were at Chaik Farm. In these proceedings, it appears, they had stated to the Society called “ the Friends of the People, this measure of a convention ; that measure the Friends of the People refused to agree in. You will find that, refusing to agree in that measure, at the meeting at Chalk Farm, when it was stated that the Society of the Friends of the People would not agree in it—indeed, agree in it they could not—you will find what was the reception, which the communication of that information met with—an universal from a body of men, amounting, I believe, to a couple of thousand there assembled. entlemen, this committee of correspondence and co-operation, you will find, met; you will find that there is in the hand-writing of the prisoner, in avery short note, an account of what was done when they met; that one of the first steps towards the accomplishment of their purposes, was a communication of the correspondences of the country societies to those who were to be the delegates of the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 511 Constitutional Society; but the meeting was’ broke up by the apprehension of the prisoner and others, which has led, as I before stated, to this prosccution. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 512 Gentlemen, I have before told you that I conceived it was competent for me, as indeed 1 apprehend without question it is, after proving the conspiracy, to show the conduct of the persons, who were parties in that conspiracy, in furtherance of the conspiracy, when it is proved. You will find that one of the persons who attended the meeting of the 20th of January 1794, and who was a very active member of the London Corresponding Society, and likewise one of the committee of correspondence and co-operation, which J have alluded to as the final act of this business, gives himself this account of the transactions of the 20th of January 1794, and of other circumstances: this is Mr. Thelwall. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 513 “ It is with infinite satisfaction that at last I received a letter from you; it was brought this morning by citizen Lee, and has been delayed, I understand, this fortnight at Rotherhithe by some accident. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 514  am too well acquainted with mankind to be surprised, too much of a philosopher to be angry at the abuse and misrepresentation of mistaken men; but I shall endeavour, as I wish to preserve the good opinion of a man whom I remember with esteem, to send you such printed documents as will prove to you that, instead of having deserted the cause of liberty, I have redoubled my zeal, and thas there is not at this time in England a man that goes bolder lengths, and exposes himself to more danger, in the cause of liberty, tham myself. I have been for four or five months past almost the sole labourer upon whom the fatigue, the danger, and the exertions of the London Corresponding Societies, the only avowed Sans Culottes in the metropolis, have rested; and have been otherwise so active in the cause, as scarcely to have passed a week without threats and conspiracies from the government and its purblind adherents. Ever since the famous, or infamous, call it which you will, proclamation of November, 1792, I have been frequenting all public Meetings where any thing could be done or expected, have been urging and stimulatin high and lew, and endeavouring to rally an encourage the friends of freedom. I have been constantly sacrificing interest and security, offending every personal advantageous connexion, till ministerialists, oppositionists, and moderees, hate me with equal cordiality, and, if I may judge by their conduct, fear me as much as they hate.. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 515 “ For these four months, I have been giving political lectures and gr and appropriating the whole receipts, till the last fortnight, to the support of our delegates to the British “ Convention ; for the history of which I must refer you to citizen Talbot, whom I have not seen tat whom I hope to see before he leaves England. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 516 e then gives an account of the meetings T have been stating to you, and of his lectures: then he says, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 517 “ Adieu. I will collect together what political papers ‘I can, to send to you when I can find leisure. Do write to me; let me know something aboat the state of politics and society in America. I fear you are somewhat short of the true Sans Culutte liberty ; that you have too much veneration for property, too much religion, and too much law. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 518  fear you are somewhat short of the true Sans Culotte liberty. Now, that is, that you have too much veneration for property, too meh religion, and too much law. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 519 Gentlemen, having now gone through the written evidence, I am to state to you some other circumstances. I have not indeed stated all the written evidence, because you will have written evidence laid before you of stimulations, under singular pretexts, to these societies, to arm themselves. You will find, that parliament, where they meant hereafter to suffer no debate, about the Hessians and Hanoverians, they circulated among them papers, and it will be brought home to those with respect to whom it is stated, to this effect — The ins tell us we are in danger of insvasion from the French ; the outs tell us that we are in danger from the Hessians and Hanoverians: ineither case, we should arm ourselves. Get arms, and leam how to use shem. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 520 You will likewise find, upon this part of the ease, that, after the dispersion of the Bri‘ish Convention in Edinburgh, after it was teen that the law of this country was strong enough to beat down .a conspiracy of that kind, acting by their mere naked numbers, that it became then, in their opinion, necessary to the accomplishment of their purpose, to act with arms. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 521 Now, gentlemen, where a general conspiracy of this sort, among affiliated societies, existed in Scotland, Sheffield, Norwich, Manchester, smd various parts of the king‘dom, all aiming at the same end, all acting upon the same principle, all involved in the same project of having a convention from the different parts of the united kingdoms, it is natural that they should think of arms: but, if the eonspiracy did not exist, it would seem a very odd thing that it should happen in fact, that, in these different rts of the kin; ‘field, and in London, we should find persons preparing arms of a sort, and of a denomination, which of late years we have not heard of in this country, except as existing in France, and except as stated in a letter from France, which I have read to you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 522 But, gentlemen, Bo will find, from the evidence I have to offer, and indeed it is not lom, in Scotland, in Shef. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 523 snprisips that you should so find—after I shall tell you, that in the pocket of one of the parties in this conspiracy, and distributed also in divisions in the London Corresponding Society, were papers, importing that upon the 1st of April, 1794, was to be periirrmesh, The Guillotine, or George’s Head inBasket ; papers in which the sacred person of the king 1s so spoken of, and in which all orders of men, under ludicrous representations of them to their country, were doomed te lamp-irons, and to suspension ; after I shall tell you, that I am instructed that Mr. Thelwall could, when retiring from Chalk-farm, take a pot of peer in his hand, with a knife take off the ead, and say, “ Thus I would serve all kings ; if you should find such language used, I am persuaded you widl not be surprised to find pikes in the hands of these men and their associates—to find muskets in the hands of these men and their associates. Do not, gentlemen, let us be misled by the great doctrine of the Bill of High that every man has a right to arms for his own protection— he has without question a right to convenient arms for his own defence; but the point before a jury will be, for what purpose had he the arms? If he attempts to say that he had them for his own defence—if had he them in fact for a worse purpose, the attempt to colour the tact makes the fact more criminal. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 524 Gentlemen of the jury, you will find that Mr. Yorke, in the month of November 1793, will be proved to have been at one of the divisions of the London Corresponding Society, stating, that he was going among the sons of liberty into Belgium, to bring into this coun try the true friends of liberty. You will find that he was a member of the Landon Cortespending Society, and constituted a delegate of the Constitutional Soeiety to Scotland ; that he has been propagating at Sheffield the same doctrine, as his brother associates were propagating in London: that he was there directing the form in which pikes should be made, to persons who were to make such instruments; that the persons at Sheffield enter into a correspondence with the prisoner at the bar; that they inform him that these pikes are made; that he delivers the direction to persons of the Corresponding Society, in order that they may furnish themselves with these instruments ; and that they were to be furnished from Sheffield to a place here, I think, the Parrot, ix Green Arbour alley, or some other place in this town; and that, if the apprehension of these persons here, and at Shetheld, had not put an ead to the farther execution of the project, there would have been a large apron of these pikes into this part of the kingdom. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 525 Gentlemen, you will find that this idea of arms was carried farther; you will find that, for the use of this society, a plate with figures, showing the manner of learning the military exercise, was engraved by a Mr. Worship, a member of this society. You will find that there was a military society in Lambeth, and another in Turnstile, Holborn; they were small in their beginnings, I admit; but these things must be so in their beginnings; and you will find, that the prisoner at the bar ve'to a witness of the name of Edwards, a jirection of whom to obtain pikes at Sheffield. Mr. Williams; another witness, who will be called to you, who is a gun-engraver in the Tower, made muskets for the use of these societies in Lambeth, and in Turnstile, with an express protest that he should not be employed, unless he himself became a member of the societies. You will find accordingly that he did become a member of them. You will find that they drilled at particular places. Gentlemen, I give you this outline of this part of the evidence, because I do not wish to enter more into the particulars, than to give you a general impression of the nature of the case which I have to lay before you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 526 You will likewise see, what is natural enough to happen, when you find in the book of the Society for Constitutional Information, that Mr. Horne Tooke could think of giving notice, that he would move “ that two books should be vpened, one of them (bound in black) in which should be entered all the enormities of those who deserve the censure ; and in the other, the merits of those who deserve the gratitude of the society. You will not be surprised, if you should find persons in these affliated societies, of lower descriptions, holding conversations about seizing the Most august persons in the nation; if you should hear of their holding conversations about the situation of persons in the House of Commons, and the means by which they could know their persons. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 527 Upon the whole, gentlemen of the jury, I shall now lay the testimony before you, submitting this written evidence to you, calling witnesses, above all exception, to a great part of the case; calling some witnesses, whom I now avow to you, you will find, were persona employed by government to watch over the proceeslings of these societies, and who there‘ore became informed, in consequence of such employment, of some of their transactions; and government would have been wanting to itself, and would have been wanting to a degree of criminality, which no mancan describe, if this country had at this moment been in the state in which it would have been, if these pikes had been brought into actual exertion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 528 At Sheffield, indeed, I am told they had got to the length of forming iron instruments, which were to disable horse, which they called night-cats, and which would immediately insert themselves into the hoofs of horses feet. I say, if, with these projects going on im the country, a secretary of stute, or any other person in the executive government, had hesitated a moment to procure information, these parties might have been able to put into execution the projects they were mepighng. and he would have been answerable for it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 529 Gentlemen, it-is the great province of a British jury, and God forbid these prisoners should not have the benefit of the reflection, that British juries are able to protect us all— are able to sift the characters of witnesses— to determine what credit is due to them—listening to men of good character without any impression against their evidence—listening to men, such as I have stated, with a strong impression against their evidence ; that impression, however, to be beat down by the concurrent unsuspicious testimony arising out of the rest of the case, if, upon the whole ou shall find the case to be made out as I ave stated it to you1. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 530 Gentlemen, I torgot to mention to you, that you will likewise find, about the time that this convention was talked of, that there was a new constitution framed for the Corresponding Society, in which they speak of a royalist as an enemy to the liberties of his country —of a democrate, as a friend to the liberties of his country; and you will find, that, ina constitution again revised, the whole was thrown into a scheme, and into a system, which was to add physical strength to the purposes of that convention, which was, I submit to you, to assume all civil and political authority. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 531 Tf you find all these things, and, if under the direction of that wisdom that presides here, with respect to which, gentlemen, let me say again, that the situation of this country is indeed reduced to a most miserable one, if the respect, which is due to the administration of the law, is suffered to be weakened in any manner, if the respect, which is due to the administration of the law, that administration, which perhaps is the best feature of the constitution under which we live, is destroyed, miserable indeed must be the situation of your country! If you’ find under that direction that the case, being proved in fact, is also made out in law, you will do that on behalf of the public which is due to yourselves, to the public, to your posterity, and theirs. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 532 But on the other hand, if, after hearing this case fully stated, and attempted to be fully proved, you should be of opinion that it is not proved, or you should be finally of opinion that the offence is not made out ac cording to the Aallowed interpretation of the statute of Edward 3rd; I say then, in the conclusion, I pein. from my heart, in the prayer which the law makes on behalf of the prisoner, God send the prisoner a safe deliverance !

BOWER 557 “ Citizen; I am directed by the London Corresponding Society to transmit the following resolutions to the Society for Constitu‘tional Information, and to request the senti‘ments of that society respecting the important measures which the present juncture of affairs seems to require. The London Corresponding Society conceives that the moment is arrived when a full and explicit declaration is necessary from all the friends of freedom, ‘whether the late illegal and unheard-of prosecutions and sentences shall determine us to abandon our cause, or shall excite us to pursue a radical reform with an ardour proportioned to the magnitude of the object, and with a zeal as distinguished on our parts as the treachery of others in the same glorious cause is notorious; the Society for Constitutional Information is therefore required to determine whether or no they will be ready, when called upon,.to act in conjunction with this and other societies, to obtain a fair representation of the people ; whether they concur with us in seeing the necessity of a speedy convention, for the purpose of obtaining, in a constitutional and legal method, a redress of those grievances under which we at present labour, and which can only be effectually removed by a full and fair representation of the people of Great Britain, The London Corresponding Society cannot but remind their friends, that the present crisis demands all the prudence, unanimity, and vigour, that ever was or can be exerted by men and Brtons; nor do they doubt but that manly firmness and consistency will finally, and, they believe, shortly terminate in the full aecomplishment of all their wishes. I am, felow citizen (in my humble measure) a friend to the rights of man, , Harpy, Secretary. 
BOWER 558 “ Resolved unanimously,. 1. That, dear as justice and liberty are to Britons, yet the va lue of them is comparatively small without a dependence on their permanency, and there can be no security for the continuance of any right but in equal laws. 
BOWER 559 “ 2, That equat laws can never be expected but by a full and fair representation of the people ; to obtain which, in the way pointed out by the constitution, has been and is the sole object of this society ;. for this we are ready to hazard every thing, and never but with our lives will we relinquish an object which involves the happiness, or even the political existence, of ourselves and posterity. 
BOWER 560 “3, That it is the decided opinion of this society, that to secure ourselves from future feed: and scandalous prosecutions; w prevent a repetition of wicked and unjust se tences, and to recall those wise and wholesome laws that have been wrested from us, and of which scarcely a vestige remains, there ought to be immediately a convention of the people, by delegates deputed for that purpose from the different societies of the friends of freedom, assembled in the various parts of this nation, and we pledge ourselves to the public to pursue every legal method speedily accomplish so desirable a purpose.

WOOD 589 “A parliamentary reform is that which of allother things, in our opinion, deserves the attention of the public. We are more and mure convinced, by every day’s experience, that the restoring the right of voting universally to every man, not incapacitat by nature, for want of reason, or by law for commission of crimes (together with anDual elections) is the only reform that can be effectual and permanent. As Providence has kindly furnished men in every station with faculties necessary for judging of what con-y cerns themselves, it is somewhat strange that the multitude should suffer a few, with no better intellects than their own, to vsuxr the iaportant power of governing them without control, i t has has been a long and very just complaint, that a very great majority of the people of this country are not represented in pariament; that the majority of the representatives of the whole nation are chosen b number of voters not exceeding twetve t sand, Many large and populous towns have not a single vote for a representative, such as Birmingham, containing about 40,000 inhabitants, Manchester above 30,000, Leeds above 20,000, besides Sheffield, Bradford, Wolverhampton, Halifax, &c. &c. ‘ 
WOOD 590 “Let us look at the metropolis, andseewhat a great majority of the inhabitants have not a single vote. Those facts are solid evidences, therefore need no comment.

GARROW 614 Sir, I am directed by the London Corresponding Socicty to send a few copies of their address and resolutions to the Society for a Reform of Parliamentary Representation at Edinburgh ; likewise I have to inform you of their wish to enter into correspondence, and be in close connexion with your suciety : as our cause isone, our sentiments ought to be known to each other, and act with one heart in a matter of such vast importance. We began this society last January; and, since we published our declaration and resolutions, we have increased so rapidly in number and respectability, that we were under the necessity of dividing into different companies to meet at separate houses, and each division sends a delegate to meet as a committee, to transact the business of the whole society, The indorsed papers will inform you more fully of the principles we set out upon. Be so good as to deliver them to the president or secretary of your society. As I know you to bea friend of freedom, you will endeavour to proTavte a union between the two societies; for, by uniting together, we shall become stronger, and a three-fold cord is not easily broken,—I am, sir, with great respect, your most humble Servant, Thomas Harpy, secretary.

LAW 793 “ Having never before heard of your society, they wish to have some further pei ai concerning it, as to its origin, its principles, and the tum er of its teem: eh aac count in your next letter will give them great satisfaction. They do not thereughly comprehend how it would be possible to incorporate with our society three of your members 
LAW 794 Norwieh, the residing in Norwich, inasmuch as it would be impossible to communicate to them at that distance all our correspondence, and they could not attend our committees, where the business is transacted. If it is information you want, they very readily will answer any question you may put to them; and, to that end, invite you to a -regular correspondence, As to the object they have in view, they refer you to their addresses: you will therein see they mean to disseminate political knowled a thereby engage the judicious part of the nation tu demand a restoration of their rights in annual parliaments, the members of those arliaments owing their election to the unfount and even unbiassed suffrage of every citizen in possession of his reason, and not incapacitated by crimes. They consider the obtaining such parliaments to be the ground work of every necessary reform ; to this theres fore they steadily adhere, and turn themselves neither to the right nor to the left, to follow any other plan whatever; the rules and order of their society being so plain and easy, that if they can get a majority of the nation to act as they do, the pone reform will effect itself. They look upon the trifling difference that may have arisen between the several societies to be of very little consequence, and think they will subside without any ways injuring the cause. 
LAW 795 “ They think ita matter of small importance whatever name you choose to adopt. They advise you to follow their plan, and divide yourselves into small societies, cach of which to choose a delegate; the delegates, when met, to form the committee, and transact the business of the society; afterwards, let each delegate report to his division the business so dune; let him admit fresh members, communicate fresh intelligence, encourage political discussion, or read to you such books as may convey the instruction your weaker members stand in need of ; but, above all, be careful to preserve peace and good order among you; let no dispute be carried to excess; leave monarchy, democracy, and even religion, entirely aside; never dispute on these topics, let your endeavours go to increase the numbers of those who wish for a full and equal representation of the people, and leave to a parliament, so chosen, to form plans for remedying the existing abuses ; should they then not answer your expectation at the year’s end, you may choose others in their stead. The committee offer you every assistance in their power, but request that your questions may relate chiefly to the methods of obtaining a reform in parliament. Like yourselves, they are friends to peace, not aiaceny: and well-wishers to the rights of man; yet not so sanguine in their expect: tions as to imagine those rights will Testored by the spontaneous consent of those who have so long deprived mankind of them. Understanding that ou are many societies in oa ek recommend to you to unite upon the plan before mentioned; the correspondence, then carried on by one committee, will serve you all: they likewise recommend the appointment of one of the least conspicuous of your members to receive such letters as may be sent to the society, lest, if he be well known about your town to be a member, some interruption might take place in the delivery. ‘

LAW 797 “ London, the 1st February, 1793. 
LAW 798 “ gentlemen, We are instructed by the committee of delegates of the London Corresponding Society to express the satisfaction they experience in finding, by your answer to our letter, that your society are willing to communicate freely with those whose friends they profess themselves to be: not the less determined to obtain the desired reform, had you refused to act in concert with us, we yet freely acknowledge that your concurrence will add great weight to our so just demand. Leaving' the distinctions of rank, talents, and fortune, entirely out of the question, on a subject in which every man is equally interested, all must be convinced, that when members of Parliameng demand a reform, abuses certainly exist; and that when men, distinguished for their knowledge of the laws, join in the purmal, is constitutionality is sufficiently warran 
LAW 799 “ With you we think, that ‘the common happiness of all’ is the only constitutional authority laws can claim—that laws so founded must meet the affections of the whole nation and that those who seek the most effectual means of obtaining such, ‘ equally promote the present peace and the future prosperity of their country.’ -‘Venerating with you our excellent constitution, we are firmly persuaded the restoring it to its primitive purity will be found a sufficient remedy agains every abuse we complain of. Did we, however, deem less highly of its principles, we could not be brought to think ourselves so greatly degene as to be unequal to the Bike| of a task which our forefathers undertook, without fearing it would prove beyond their strength, not to disgrace them by supinely submitting to a total overthrow of the glorious fabric, reared by their yalour and cemented with their blood, from premature apprehensions of ‘ the tempest that mightensue’ in a conflict of oppression against general good—pecuniary interest, and life Itself, are never to be brought into competition with liberty. “ We thank your society for your kind advice concerning peace, order, and obedience to the laws: we made them the foundation of our union, as our addresses sufficiently evince—we have never d from obedience, and have thereby frustrated evil designs of all those who militate against reform. You acknowledge, that ‘ te wish success to the cause of freedom is congenial to the heart of a Briton,’ instead therefore Bod admitting your argument against our havi: published such Datiaiense by a friendly ade dress to the National Convention of France, that you, that all other societies, that the whole nation did not catch the generous flame, and follow our example—as to the handle likely to be made of it by our corrupt opposers (and well we have noted them), let them use it like most of their other machinaaa it will only accelerate that which they read. 
LAW 800 “ We must observe, that at a time when the enemies of mankind are exerting every Ee to crush the infant effort ef French hi
LAW 801 'y, it became our duty, as friends to human happiness, to express the just abhorrence we entertained of a manifesto which we conceived aimed, not so much at the liberty of France as at the liberty of the world. But to make any particular comments upon that manifesto is now unnecessary, as it might be unsafe—we only wish every Briton to peruse it. 
LAW 802 iad seepardliens of any evil intention, which the malice of our enemies may attribute to our conduct, we remain conscious of our rectitude; and that we therein acted up to the free, open, manly, generous national character of Britons—a character which oppression, assisted by enervating luxury, has not yet been able to entirely extinguish. 
LAW 803 “Unnoticed, however, you have tree over our statement ofabuses, our addresses to the nation, our demand of protection, addressed to those whose duty it is to afford it, and our answer to the calumnies of Mr. Reeves’s association, we request your notice ofthem. Pressed likewise by our numerous country correspondents to give them authentic information of what measures you mean to pursue when you mean to begin, and how far you intend carrying your proposed reform; we beg your explicit answer on these heads, and that you will enable us speedily to rightly inform the country thereon—no ways doubting, but that from your answer, we shall be enabled to assure them that you are really what your title imports, the Friends of the People, for many thousands of whom, in the name of the London Corresponding Society, united in one common interest and pursuit, with man other societies in different parts of the isl. altogether forming no despicable number of usotal members of society; we have the honour of subscribing ourselves, your fellow. labourers, and humble servants. 
LAW 804 “ Sir; I am directed by the Society of the Friends of the People to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated February 1, 17953 
LAW 805 having pledged ourselves by our public actsand documents, to use every effort in our power for the purpose ofobtainingacomplete, substantial, andi radical reform of the representation uf the people in parliament, we never can be cos posed to have surrendered to any other body of men the exercise of our own discretion, with respect both to the plan which we deem most effectual for the purpose, and the time which we may think most favourable for offering it to the public; at present we think, that to make public our views on these subjects, would be to furnish arms to our enemies, and to injure the cause in which we are engaged. The period, however, is probably not very far distant when these particulars will be made known to the public; it is sufficient now to apes our confidence, 
LAW 806 1 that moment will prove by evidence More substantial than professions; that we will propose no plan of reform which is short of an effectual destruction of abuses in the representation of the people, and that we have honestly exerted every faculty we possess in choosing the time most favourable to the success of our plan. 
LAW 807 “ We have learned, with affliction and indignation, the arbitrary and unconstitutional interruption of meshing of citizens, peaceably and lawfully assembled for the discussion and maintenance of their rights. We have ever viewed with utter disapprobation both of their principles and proceedings, the associations who have been the authors or instruments of this persecution. Their principles, we think, are repugnant to the free spirit of the English law; and their conduct, we think, has been as injurious and oppressive, as the principle of their institution is unconstitutional and absurd. But deeply penetrated as we are with these sentiments, we neither possessed power nor legal competence to interpose for the protection of an individual, suffering even under the most unjust prosecution, we cannot therefore feel ourselves blameable for inaction in cases of which the particulars were never laid before us, and in which it might have been perhaps impossible, rae perhaps improper, for us to have interfe 
LAW 808 “‘We do not think it necessary to make any particular remarks on those publications which you have put forth; we are not called upon to pronounce any judgment on the publications of individuals or societies; and however we may lament the grievances of which some of your publications complain, our efforts must necessarily be limited to the object of our institution—the creation of an to speak the public voice in legislation. 
LAW 809 “We cannot help expressing some surprise at the information, that societies in different ts of the kingdom, who were solicitous about the nature and extent of our plans of reform, instead of expressing such solicitude to ourselves, should have chosen the indirect and oircuitous channel of apy other society. 
LAW 810 Had they applied to the Friends ef the People directly, they would assuredly have received every information compatible with prudence, and with a due regard to the success of our common cause. 
LAW 811 “On the subject of your correspondence with the National Convention of France, we freely communicated to you our opinion in our last letter; we see no reason to change the sentiments which we then expressed on the prudence and tendency of that measure, for though we not only ‘ acknowledge, but avow with pride, ‘ that to wish success to the cause of freedom is congenial to the heart of a Briton ;’ yet we cannot think that men engaged in so momentous a cause, as that of parliamentary reform, are. entitled to make public declarations, even of their most viriuous sentiments, in any manner which may injure that cause, serve the purposes, and strengthen the pretexts of its enemies. Far be it from us to treat with severity and rigour even those errors and indiscretions into which men may be betrayed by a generous zeal for the cause of freedom, but surely it cannot be denied, that the correspondence of societies in this country with public bodies in France, has furnished the most specious pretences to interested men, for confounding a virtuous sensibility to the interests of liberty in other countries, with a criminal intention to introduce disorder and civil commotion into our own ; it is chiefly by the help of this pretext, that designing men have so successfully prace tised on the alarms of the Se and that timid honesty has been rendered the dupe and the instrument of corruption. But on this subject all further remark is now become unnecessary, as every good citizen must now feel himself precluded from all political intercourse with, France (for a period which we earnestly pray may be very short), by a war, the principle of which we utterly disapprove, the inevitable evils of which we deeply deplore, and at the possible consequences of which we tremble. Among the most wise and honest friends of liberty there must arise frequiens differences of opinion and of conduct; and these differences, the natural effect of an independent judgment and independent spirit, are perfectly compatible with mutual confidence nde g co-operation; when indecd designing persons avail themselvesof such differences, tosow distrust, and to insinuate suspicivas against the characters and intentions of men, it is then only that they become perniciousand injurious, Against practices which might produce such a spirit of disunion and distrust, it is surely almost unnecessary to warn the friends of liberty, at a moment when our enemies are so formidable and so united. They havesacrificed all inferior interests and all former differences to their common interest, in perpetuating abuses and corruptions. Let it not be said, that more generous motives have a less powerful influence on the human mind, and that the love of liberty is not able to produce that union among her friends, whieh in her enemies has arisen from the most abject and sordid passions. 
LAW 812 “ It seems scarce necessary to represent to the London Corresponding Society the pe‘culiar necessity of circumspection and moderation, at a moment when the most venial indiscretion of the friends of reform is remarked with such malignant watchfulness, and converted into an argument against the cause of reform itself. 
LAW 813 “ He must surely either be a secret enemy, or an unsafe and pernicious friend of that cause, who could prompt you to any thing that could be construed into indiscretion, or who would labour to sow distrust among the small number of those who now appear in behalf of freedom in England, at a period when a persecution is carried on against the friends of reform at home, and a war is commenced, which in its progress may combine the arms of England with those of powers engaged in a crusade against the general liberties of Europe
LAW 815 o Mr. Thomas Hardy, secretary to the London Corresponding Society. 
LAW 816 “ Mr. Edward Lauzun deposed, that he found the following paper in Mr. Hardy’s house. Sir, The committee of the London Corresponding Society have at present to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th of apa f “ With pleasure we perceive your societ not unwillin gto keepupacorrespondence wit! tus, yet at the same time we are sorry that you should appear to be hurt by the plain questions we put to you in our last; to ask of you what measures you mean to pursue in a matter which concerns us all, is certainly ne ways calling upon you to surrender up to our society, or even to the public at large, your discretion ; nor can we conceive that a of men having pledged themselves to the public, can be a sufficient security to that public to repose implicit confidence in them, without being made further acquainted with the nature and extent of the plan you mean to pursue, in order that we the people may, if we approve it, co-operate with you; the extent of your porponedt refers we apprehend is already determined upon, and we can discover no advantage likely to result from its secrecy ; on the contrary, if we are to ask for ourselves the same thing which our friends mean to ask for us, the latter must receive their instructions from us, or we must be ditected by them ; in either case there must be no secrets ; we further conceive, that the permanency of a reform must be founded on the ee of the public, who after merely berating om every thing proposed, have found your plan the most useful and the best that could possibly be laid down. The business we are engaged in is of too important a nature to admit of reserve or disguise ; 
LAW 817 we will therefore, by the frankness of our behaviour, show ourselves worthy the friendship of a society of honest men endeavouring to serve their country, and plainly tell you our country correspondents did not desire us to inquire of you what you meant to do, but fairly asked us whether we thought you honest? whether we thought you meant to serve 2 party, or the nation? whether we imagined you intended a partial or a complete reform? Addressed in this manner to us, and blunt as these questions may appear, they have nothing in them whieh can possibly offend you, the people having always an undoubted right to scrutinize the character andprinciples of those who call themselves their friends, and, as such, avow an intention of bringing. forward measures in which we are so deeply interested. As to the furnishing our enemies with arms by a disclosure of our intention, we cannot conceive that demands, founded on constitutional rights, can lose any of their force by being made public. Reason (vires acquirit eundo) to triumph requires only to be known; and as none of the ple’s demands are founded on fallacy, to take the enemy by surprise weuld be unworthy of the public champions, and moreover, perfectly needless when truth and reason must unavoidably bear down aH before them without the assistance of guile. 
LAW 818 “ Under the idea that, where you say you neither possessed power, nor legal compe“tence to interfere for the protection of an individual, suffering under the most unjust prosecution,’ you allude to the case of our bill sticker, we must beg to set you right, and to inform you we never, as a society, sought the interference of any body of men; on the contrary, we are firmly persuaded, however hard such cases may bear upon individuals, they will eventually prove of service to the public, nothing having a greater tendency towards rousing the country from its too prevalent apathy, with regard to stretch of prerogative and abuse of power. 
LAW 819 “ As to our Address tothe French National Convention, we imagine it best to say ho more about it at present, only that if it has furnished pretexts to designing men, it has only saved them the trouble of seeking excuses elsewhere: but such men, eves without our aid, would have been at no loss ; at the same time, we are to believe the plan for war, if conceived before then, was by no means accelerated thereby; intended as preventatives, addresses might have been effectual, if they had not been more generally adopted; the only fault therein, that by a mistaken idea; the addressers mre credit to phe pei hes a ter a of energy t it posSoseed. ea agree wilt you, that umity of sentiment is ne-way ingpmpatible with diver. 
LAW 820 sity of opinion, and that the latter is natural to m mt minds; with the same object in view, their mode of pursuing it will andoubtedly differ; with caution, therefore, we will watch over those who wish to sow athe seeds of unnecessary distrust among us, and will at the same time take good care that the doctrine of implicit confidence may Dot gain ground among us; full as much as yoursetves, we plead the necessity of union among the friends of liberty, but isment that it is prevented, or at least retarded in many instances by the very same thing that promotes it among the enemies of reform, namely, interest; with them, all their interest is for the continuation of abuses, ‘while to some of us a reform must be attended with ‘pecumiary loss, and many others would lose their employ, their daily bread, were it dcpown they took an active part; thus, the same motive, assuming on one side the appearance of a virtue, gives emulation to bad amen, and on the other, in its vilest bat most aatural ferm, stays the pepsiess of those who, with the best intentions, labour to save their coentry.

EYRE 925 “ Friends and Fellow Countrymen; Unless we are greatly deceived, the time is approaching when the object for which we struggle is likely to come within our reach. That a nation like Britain should be free, it is requisite only that Britons should will it, to So. That such should be their will, the abuses of our original constitution, and the alarm of our aristocratic enemies, sufficiently witness. Confident in the purity of our motives, and in the justice of our cause, let us meet falsehood with proofs, and hypocrisy with plainness, let us persevere in declaring our principles, and misrepresentation will meet its due reward—contempt. 
EYRE 926 “In this view, the artifices of a late aristocratic association, formed on the 20th instant, call for a few remarks, on account ef the declaration they have published relative to other clubs and societies formed in this nation. It is true that this meeting of gentlemen (for so they style themselves) have mentioned no names, instanced no facts, quoted no authoTities ; but they take upon themselves to assert, that bodies of their countrymen have been associated, professing opinions favourable to the rights of man, to liberty, and equality ; and, moreover, that those opinions are conveyed in the terms, no King, no Parliament
EYRE 928 “ If this be intended to include the societies to which we respectively belong, we here, in the most solemn manner, deny thelatter part of the charge; while, in admitting the former, we claim the privilege and glory in the character of Britons; whoever shall attribute te us, who wish only the restoration of the lost liberties of our country, the expressions of Ne King, No Parliament, or any design of invading the property of other men, is guilty of a e Mis an impudent, and a malicious falseood. 
EYRE 929 “We know, and are sensible, that the wages of every man arc his right; that difference of strength, of talents, and of industry, do, and ought to afford proportional distinctions of property, which when acquired and confirmed by the laws, is sacred and inviolable; we defy the most slavish and malevolent man in the meeting of the 20th instant, to bring the remotest proof to the contrary. If there be no proof, we call upon them to justify an insidious calumny, which seems invented only to terrify independent Britons from reclaiming the rightful constitution of their country. We adinit, and we declare, that we are friends to civil liberty, and therefore to natural equality, both of which we consider as the rights of mankind, Could we believe them to be ‘in direct opposition “ to the laws of this land,’ we should blush to find ourselves among the number of its inhabitants; but we are persuaded that the abuses of the constitution will never pass current for its true principles; since we are told in its first charter, that all are equal in the sight of the law, whichshall neither be sold, nor refused, nor delayed, to any freeman what“ soever ;’ should it ever happen that ‘ right and justice’ are apposed by expense, by refusal, or by delay, then is this principle of equality violated, and we are no longer free men. 
EYRE 930 “ Such are our notions of those rights which it is boldly maintained ‘ are inconsis“ tent with the well being of society.’ But let us not suffer men who avow no principles of liberty, whose favourite cry is inequality of Property, to estrange others of our countrymen from aiding us in serving the community, and from recovering to the nation that share of its:sovereignty which has unhappily been sacrificed to corrupt courtiers and intriguing boroughmongers. 
EYRE 931 “ Ifour laws and constitution be just and wise in their origin and their principle, every deviation from them as first established, must be injurious to the people, whose persons and property were then secured; if at the revolution this country was adequately represented, it is now so no longer, and therefore calls aloud for reform. 
EYRE 932 “ If it be true that the people of Britain are superior to other nations, is it that our taxes are less burthensome? or that our provisions are less expensive? is it from the various productions of our svil that we are rich? is it owing to the majority of our numbers that we are strong? Certainly not. France has the advantage in all these respects, and, up to this period, she has never Been our superior in wealth, in power, in talents, or in virtues. But let us not deceive ourselves, the diffcrence between us and that nation was formerly, that our monarchy was limited, while theirs was absolute; that the number of our aristocracy did not equal the thousandth part of theirs; that we bad trial by jury, while they had none; that our persons were protected by the laws, while their lives were at the mercy of every titled individual: we therefore had that to fight for which to them wasunknown; since we were men while they were slaves. 
EYRE 933 “¢ The scene indeed has changed; like our brave ancestors of the last ccntury, they have driven out the family that would have destroyed them; they have scattered the mercenaries who invaded their freedom, and have ‘ broken their chains on the heads of their oppressors.’ If during this conflict with military assassins and domestic traitors, cruelty and revenge have arisen among a few inhabitants of the capital let us lament these effects of a bloody and tyrannous manifesto, but let us Icave to the hypocrite pretenders to humanity, the task of blackening the misfortune, and attributing to whole nation the act of an enraged popuace. 
EYRE 934 “ As we have never yet been cast so low at the foot of despotism, so it is not requisite that we should appeal to the same awful tribunal with our Petiren on the continent. May our enmities be written in sand, but may our rights be engraven on marble! We de sire tu overthrow no property but what has been raised on the rums of our liberty: we look with reverence on the landed and commercial interests of our country, but we view with abhorrence that monopoly of burgage tenures, unwarranted by law or reason in this or any other nation in Europe. 
EYRE 935 “ Let us then continue with pleasure and firmness in the path which is begun; let us then wait and watch the ensuing sessions of ppulanceng, from whom we have much to nope, and little to fear. ‘The House of Commons may have been thd source of our calamity, it may prove that of our deliverance. Should it not, we trust we shall not prove unworthy of our forefathers, whose exertions in the cause of mankind so well deserve our imitation.

GARROW 955 Indorsed, “ Received the 10th of June, 1793; answered the 20th of July. 
GARROW 956 “ Edinburgh, 25th of Mey, 1793. 
GARROW 957 “ Mr. Hardy, Sir, Mr. Urquhart did me the pleasure to call on Thursday afternoon, and delivered your letter of the 17th cusremt. I am much pleased with the contents of it, and shall lay it before the first meeting of our societies here, which however does not take place till Monday seven-night. I weuld have acknowledged the receipt of your favour by yesterday’s post, but was too much emluyed in removing our household to another lodging to attend to any thing else. 
GARROW 958 f either you in England, or we in Sceotland should attempt separately the reform which we, I trust, seek to obtain, we should, by so doing, only expose ous weakness, and manifest our ignorance of the corruption which opposes our important und ig. If we sought only the extirpation of one set of interested men from the management of national affairs, that place might be given to another set, without affecting the vitals adverse to the system of reform. These might be easily accomplished ; but to cut 2 deep and wide rooted prejudices, to give effectual energy to the dictates of truth, in favour of public virtue and national prosperity, in eppesition to self and all its interested habits, and to withstand and overawe the final efforts of the powers of darkness, is the work of the whole, and not of a part; a work to which mankind, till this awful period, were never adequate, because never till now disposed to traternize ; not merely, or only I trust, from the sense of the common danger to which we are exposed, but from the ennobling prim ciple of universal benevolence. 
GARROW 959 “1 know no greater service that I can do my conty than to promote the unien you so wisely desire ; and I am happy to assure you that I have hitherto discovered no sentiment in our association adverse to the mest intimate and brotherly union with the associationsin England. 
GARROW 960 I think the minds of all must, in the nature of things, be now turned to more effectual means of reform. Not one person was convinced of the necessity of it by the most convincing arguments of reason, together with the most unequivocal expressions of universe} 
GARROW 961 desire; what then is to be hoped for fromto be apprehensive of the abilities of our own repetition? I am only afraid that the bow in England against reform was so contracted that in returning, it may break. You would willingly learn, you say, from us: I own that we ought to be forward in this: we have at once, in great wisdom, perfected our plan of organization; and, if we were in the same independent state of mind asthe people of England, we would be able to take the lead. The associations with you are no more, I fear, (excuse my freedom) than an aristocracy for the good of the people: they are indeed moderate, firm, and virtuous ; and better cannot be : but we are the people themselves, and we are the first to show that the people can both judge and resolve, if undirected by faction, with both wisdom and moderation. 
GARROW 962 “I have not a higher wish, in the present exertions for reform, than to see the people universally and regularly associated, because I am persuaded that the present disastrous engagements will issue in ruin, and the people then must provide for themselves; and it would be unhappy, when we should be ready to act with unanimity, to be occupied about organization, without which, however, anarchy must ensue. We will not need but to be prepared for the event, to stand and see the “salvation of the Lord.’ Let us therefore take the hint given us by our opposers ; let us begin in earnest to make up our minds relative to the extent of reform which we ought to seek; be prepared to justify it, and to controvert objections; let us model the whole in the Public mind; let us provide every stake and stay of the tabernacle which we would erect, so that when the tabernacles of oppression in the palaces of ambition are broken down, under the madness and folly of their supporters, we may then, without anarchy and all dangerous delay, erect at once our tabernacle of righteousness, and may the Lord himself be in it! 
GARROW 963 “ How hurtful to the feelings of a reflecting mind to look back to the wretched state in which the Roman monarchy, enfeebled and ken by its own corruptions, left the nations which it had subjected! like ‘ sheep without a shepard they soon became a prey to every invader, because there was none to gather and unite them: had they, foresecing the evil, associated for mutual detence, no robber would have been able to enslave them; the would have given laws to all parties, as well as to theinsclves; all separate colonies and nations would have sought their alliance: but mot having virtue to associate and heal the divisions, and root out the selfish spirit, which ambition-fostering governments procure to their subjects, they fell under oppressors, from under whose iron sceptre they have never yet been able to deliver themselves. We may suppuse an event which we deprecate; nay, should we not be prepared for every possible issue of the present unprecedented divisions of mankind, we have a right managers, who are so afraid to depart from precedent, that, like men of detail, they may be inadequate to the task of preserving the vessel from shipwreck, now grappling with danger, not only great, but new and uncommon. If the present ministry fail, who after them shall be trusted? It requires little penetration to see the anarchy and discord which will follow: it will be such that nothing short of a general union among the people them selves will be able to heal: haste, therefore, to associate, at least to be ready to associate. If then, such a broken state of things should take place, the civil broils that would necessarily ensue, would soon subside before the united irresistible voice of the whole. Do not, I entreat you, hesitate thinking sueh a work premature as yet: but a month, and then it may be too late. A malignant may be already formed, and only waiting for the halting of the present managers ; it will then be too late to seck to‘subject to deliberation, after a party has dared the act of rebeh lien. If you go no further than separate meetings in different towns, we will not be able to confide in your confraternity, because, while in such a state, you may be but the tools of a faction. We could have all confidence, and unite with all affection in one assembly of commissioners from all countries of the world, if we knew they were chosen by the unbiassed voice of the people, because they would come up with the same disinterested views and desires as ourselves, havi all agreed to a common centre of union aud interest; but we could not confide in fellowcitizens who kept aloof from such union, and would not previously affiliate in one great and indivisible family. n troubling you with so long an epistle, I have atleast shown my inclination to core respond. I have also hinted at things which appear to me the present subjects of consideration, because I am desirous of your opinion upon them; I have possibly wrote with too much freedom, but you will place it to account of zeal in the cause, and on this score discharge my design, which is disinterested and hilanthropic. With sincere esteem and affection, Lam, sir, your well-wisher, “W. Surrvine, secretary. 
GARROW 979 We now propose to read an answer to the last letter, found in the possession of the prisoner. 
BOWER 989 It is impossible. t 
EYRE 990 What is your own judgment as to the course we ought to pursue? Mr. Attorney General, have you nearly concluded your evidence ? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 991 Not half. 
EYRE 993 As to what is now hinted at, itis matter of very great importance to the public justice of the country In every view of it. It is undoubtedly a general rule, that there is to be no adjournment and no separation of the jury after the evidence is entered upon, until the jury bave. given their verdict. That is a rule which I shall never willingly depart from, nor ever consent to depart from but ina case of extreme necessity, and where therefore the necessity of the case will justify a deviation from the strict rule of law. 
EYRE 994 I think the necessity does exist in every case in which it shal! appear that the cause wil] go into such a length that the attention of a jury cannot be kept alive to it throughout, without the assistance of some refreshment ; and where, from that length, they cannot have that assistance from the Court, which by law they are entitled to have; provided that necessity, therefore, is apparent in this case, I should certainly readily incline to enter intoa consideration of the qucstion, whether we can, and, if we can, whether we ouglit to adjourn ; and in what way it may be done. 
EYRE 995 I know that, in point of fact, there was anadjournmentin onecriminal case: but that was a misdemeanor : there was a doubt started whe“ther in that case, though the court adjourned, the jury should not be kept together. I have not been able to learn with any certainty what the fact was; but there is one circumstance from whence I do conclude that, in truth, the jury could not have been kept together during the whole of that time, because the adjournment thcre was over an entire day at two different times in the course of the hearing of that cause ; and I have no imagination that the jury were kept together during all that time, unless the adjournment oeerihe day was only for a few hours; but it is s0 long ago, that few people remember how it was; I conceive that, under that adjournment, the jury must have becn allowed to separate. 
EYRE 996 I am not satisfied that, in strict law, there is a clear distinction between the case of allowing a jury to separate in a misdemeanor and ma capital case. I believe the rule of lew is the same; and I am inclined to think that the strict rule was, that, even ina civil case, the jury could not separate after the ease was once gone into. 
EYRE 997 In the 14 Harry 7th, there was a question debated in the Exchequer Chamber (is in the year book) upon the effect of the jury having, in consequence of a violent storm to which they were exposed, separated for a time; they afterwards returned again, and delivered their verdict. But the principal doubt that arose in that case, was the circumstance of a juryman having taken some yefreshment from the hand of a friend of one of the parties; however, that question never was decided; and I do not know that there is any other case in which the question has been much considered : therefore, if the counsel for the prisoner make the application to the court upon the ground of a necessity interesting to the prisoner, andif the counsel for the prosecution consent to that application upon such grounds as are proper to influence the jadgmentof the prosecutor, it seems to me in some way or other, it would be right that an adjournment should take place. I showki have no difficulty with regard to the Court; the difficulty that occurs to my mind is with segard to the separation of the jury. ularly, and properly, and agreeably to the ancient course, the jury ought to be kept toether. 
EYRE 998 e There are a great number of civil cases in the old books where the jury could not agree, or something happened in the course of the cause that made it necessary for the Court to be consulted before the cause could proceed. The practice was where the jury was sent for from the country to Westminster-hall, there a hostel was provided for them, and they were always sent back to their hostel: there they were attended by an officer, and kept mm all communication: but modern times have totally changed the habits of business, and there are hardly any traces of that now left, and that sort of thing is impracticable. 
EYRE 999 I made some inquiry what might be done (the subject, you see, was not totally out of my thoughts) if it should so happen that the necessites of public justice should extort from us a departure from the general rule: and the sherills, who have been always disposed to do what is right for them to do, and to give us all the assistance that is possible, did promise that they would endeavour to accommodate the jury in this house: whether that can be done, or whether we can depart even from that strictness, and suffer the jury 0 go to their own houses, upon the application of the prisoner and the consent of the poses, taking their word of honour that they would have no communication with any body upon the subject of this cause; that is a question upon which i should much wish to hear what my brothers have to say, after asking the uestion again of the sheritl, what caa be one here? 
EYRE 1001 itis a distressing thing to put the jury into these circum stances, which I should be sorry for, but it is better than sitting up for three days and two nights, which, for any thing I can see, must be the case. I am very ready to take my share of the fatigue, but my apprehension is, that the cause cannot be so effectually tned as it would be if the Court and jury had the refreshment of food and rest. 
EYRE 1003 I think it is not simply that he may give that ind I think he must ask it as necessary to his defence. 
MACDONALD 1005 The reason why the jury should never separate was, that they should not give in their verdict under any improper impression : but if that should superinduce an atter impossibility that justice could be done either by the jury or the bench; pay, by the witnesses pessibly, whose recollection, if they sit up for many hours, must be extremely imperfect: and ifthe gentlemen at the bar cannot do justice to their clients on either side,—if that is the case, and justice cannot be done, you must look to the prisoner, his case requires equal regard. The prosecutor’s evidence had the opportunity of being heard when the jury were fresh; now, if they are incapacitated to attend to his case in the way that his case requires, justice will not be done to him. 
MACDONALD 1006 If we are under the absolute necessity of departing in some degree from the strict rule, I dank we'should depart as little as possible ; and, therefore, I confess the only hesitation in my mind is between the jury's being accommodated here and their going home to their own houses: I have a great deal of difficulty, I own, about that. 
GARROW 1008 We have the same anxious desire, provided it can be done consistently with the rules of law, that the jury may be accommodated. 
EYRE 1009 If the jury live at a great distance, they might rather choose to sleep here. e 
HOTHAM 1011 Mr. Erskine stated himself to be in a very delicate situation, which he certainly is ; and it is impossible for him not to see that the Court also are ina very delicate situation; because, as to ourselves, if the adjournment is to take place, every body knows that there is no reason why we should be kept in this house ; we may go to our respective homes; at the same tine, there never has Leen an instance of a jury separating, and going away in the manner that is now etapa. Tcontess I think that there may be very serious consequences from it, As to the necessity, I think nobody can resist it; itis evident that the trial must go to such a length, that it cannot be proceeded upon safely without some sort of an adjournment of that kind: but I do foresee very serious difficulties hereafter, as well as pethaps in this very case, in gentlemen going home, and separating themselves. It is a very delicate and unpleasant situation to be pblized to say to gentlemen that they must be kept here all night; but really, if I am forced to speak, I think that they ought not to separate. 
EYRE 1014 Do you think you are able to go on all night? if you do go on all night we shall make but a certain progress, and I am afraid we shall be in no condition to pursue our business to-morrow. 
EYRE 1017 The rule of law is clear beyond all doubt; at the same time, the necessity of public justice arises distinctl. and visibly, and is felt by all mankind: i my apprehension, that will justify a departure from the strict rule, but it will only justify that departure as far as the necessity goes, and there the difficulty is: but, to be sure, if the jury can be accommodated, and can have that refreshment which is necessary to go on, without separating, then the necessity have been speaking of does not carry them through the whole case of being allowed to separate. As there is nu doubt in any body’s mind about it, we must‘desire the sheritls to give the jury all the accommodation they can furnish them with, and we must desire of them to submit to a difficulty which I am very sorry is imposed upon them, but which I do not see any means of avoiding. Bailiffs must be sworn to attend the jury. The counsel for the prisoner will observe, that the recorg mutt be made up as of the first day of the trial. 
EYRE 1020 We. shall certainly be disposed to give the counsel for the prisoner all reasonable opportunity to make the best defence the nature of the case is capable of. I observe the greater number of papers that have been read, and the most important as yet, are papers that are printed, and before us, therefore, there can be no difficulty as to them, for I have no doubt that the printed papers have been very well considered—To-morrow we shall see what the papers will be; if there are any which appear to us, or shall appear to you, to be papers that require a careful casting your eye over before you prepare for your defence, I shall certainly propose to the Sour that you su have a reasonable opportunity for so loing. 
MACDONALD 1021 With resi to the complaint of the privy council, there is no instance, I believe, of their ever suffering such a communication, 
EYRE 1023 I do not think it possible for the Court to have interfered upon any ground. It is one thing to permit the prisoner to see the evidence that is to be made use of against him, and it is another thing, if it should so happen, that in the seizing of his papers, there arg papers not fit to be made use of against him, but that are necessary for his defence, that such papers should have been seen; in that case, I apprehend that upon an application to the privy council or the secretary of state, that they would do what public justice requires—order access to such pas pers. The papers which are to be produced y the prosecutor, a prisoner never has by law, nor ought to have an opportunity of examine ing till they are produced in evidence. Papers that are not necessary for the prosecution, ut necessary for his defence, come under a very different predicament, and I think the rule held upon them would be very different, 
LAW 1024 The papers in the case of Mr. Sayre had been seized, and the chief justice said, give notice of the papers you. want,. and move for them. 
EYRE 1025 If you asked to look at those papers which were intended to be produced against you, I do not think that was right. 
EYRE 1027 I believe we had better not discuss the thing now.

I was at a meeting on the day this mentions, and the determination of the association are universal suffrages and annual parliaments, and it was tbe unanimous desire and wish of that meeting, that two persons, if possible, should be sent from our society in England, as delegates, to meet our dear northern frends in the ensuing convention. I must earnestly desire the said wish of our friends here may be complied with, as it will add to the dignity of our association in particular, and to the convention in general, and will further the common cause much, ina way the Judgment of our association must hit upon, without any explanation of mine. If any person could be elected of sound principles, a clear understanding speaker, with a long head and a good warm heart in ‘the cause of freedom, having it in view, and not his own aggrandizement, such a delegate would be of great service. If sucky a one is chosen, he must be here by the twenty-ninth day of this month, as the convention meets on that day; and if my poor feeble efforts will be of any service to the convention as the other delegate, the London Corresponding Society may command me for the support of their interests as far as lam capable; but those of you who know me, know I am no speaker, much less an orator, but this I will say, my heart lies in the right pare and hates and abhors all despots, lease to communicate this to our friends, and let me know the society’s determination, if they will honour me with their confidence. I am often with our friend Muir; he bears his confinement with a fortitude of soul, inspired with the genius of liberty; he is well. I have much to say, but I must leave off.

BOWER 1124 These are the proceedings of the convention. 
EYRE 1131 I take it for granted they mean to do that, because, otherwise, the proceedings of the convention at Edinburgh can be nothing in this cause. 
BOWER 1132 There are subsequent approbations of them without end; we shall read evidence enough of that by and by. 
EYRE 1133 There is enough, in my opinion, to let in the evidence; the application of it is quite another censideration: this is the act of a body, to which this prisoner sent persons to act in his name; he may afterwards to be sure object that they exceeded their commission, and therefore they are personally responsible; but I think that will be observation upon the evidence, it is no objection to the evidence. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1135  Mr. Skirving must be considered as agent to the society, and it is extremely important, as it seems to me.

GARROW 1162 I believe you are a printer by business— Yes. Were you employed at any time to print a number of these papers
GARROW 1164 When were you employed
GARROW 1166 By whom were you employed
GARROW 1168 Was any body with him when he came with it
GARROW 1170 Were there more persons than one
GARROW 1172 What orders did he give F ia respecting it
GARROW 1175 We submit that it is. 
GARROW 1177  submit to your lordsbtp that it is the clearest evidence in the wor after that which your lordships and the jury have already heard. We have proved, by a great variety of evidence, much of it under the hand and signature of the prisoner now at id lordship’s bar, much by papers found in is custody at the time of his apprehension, a clear connexion and conspiracy upon the subject of this high treason between Mir. Thelwall and the prisoner. We therefore submit to your lordships with confidence, but with deference undoubtedly, that all the acts of Mr. Thelwall, or any other person against whom we have given evidence, fitto be submitted to the jury of their accession to the peneral plan of the conspiracy, is clearly evidence against every man charged with that conspiracy ; this therefore is an act of Mr. Thelwall’s ; it is hardly worth discussing in this instance, only that it is as well to do it the first time that the objection arises; but we have other evidence, such as the defendant’s paying for the printing; but having given evidence of Thelwall and Hardy being parties to the neral conspiracy alleged as high treason, we have a right to give in evidence any acts of these conspirators relative to that object against any of them. 
EYRE 1180 That is what I was going to observe, the insisting on one ide, and objecting on the other, is perfectly Premature, for not knowing what the contents of the paper are, the Court cannot judge whether it is a branch of the evidence of the general conspiracy, or something personal with which the prisoner has nothing to do. 
GARROW 1181 I take the liberty of stating to the Court, that the ground and foundation upon which I humbly submit to read this Paper is, that it is an instrument to carry into lect the general high treason charged in this indictment. One stage or step of the conspiracy being a paper to excite the subjects of this country to desert their allegiance, and in defiance of that allegiance to set about to call a convention by force to assume the power of the legislature. It is as an instrument and a paper to carry that into effect that we desire to read it. 
EYRE 1183 tIt is necessary in order for the Court to judge whether it is of the tendency you describe, to open to us tbat part of the paper which you say has that tendency. I have cast my eye over the paper, and I see that there is a passage in it which does go to the general object. 
GARROW 1185 I shall not by any ingenuity of my friend be drawn into the argument of an abstract question, I forbore to state the paper, lest it might be said I was giving the effect of it; I will now state the passage which I say demonstrates that it is of that quality, “You may ask, perhaps, by what means shall we seek redress? We answer, that men in a state of civilized society are bound to seek redress of the grievances from the laws as long as any redress can be obtained by the laws. But our common Master whom we serve (whose law is a law of liberty, and whose service is perfect freedom) has taught us not to expect to gather grapes from thorns, nor figs from thistles, We must have redress from our own laws, and not from the laws of our plunderers, enemies, and oppressors. There is no redress tor a nation circumstanced as we are, but ina fair, free, and full representation of the people. 
GARROW 1186 Now we allege and humbly insist that we have given much evidence to show that the purpose of this conspiracy, which is charged to be high treason, was, by force to assume the power of legislation, in despite of the constituted authorities of the country, as they at present happily exist here, by substituting a convention of the people. 
EYRE 1188 This purports to be a paper containing a resolution at a general meeting of the London Corresponding Society, held at the Globe tavern; it is brought to the printer by one of the members of that society, the prisoner being another member of that society, acting in that society as the secretary; then they being both involved therefore in the proceedings of that society, and this being a printed paper produced by one of them, it does seem to me that in a general charge of a conspiracy this is evidence to prove a circumstance in that conspiracy : whether it will be ultimately so brought home to the prisoner, Hardy, as that he should be responsible for the guilt of having published it, may be another consideration, but that it is a branch of the conspiracy, and a circumstance occurring in it, the import of the paper plainly proves. It does seem to me, theretore, that it is admissible. 
GARROW 1189 What directions did Mr. Thelwall give you when he brought you the manuecript for the purpose of printing 
GARROW 1191 What were you to do with the two thousand when you had printed them? ; 
EYRE 1193 Whether it is two thousand, or what number, cannot be material, it is the publication of an act of this society. 
EYRE 1195 It applies to the society, as far as relates to the general transactions of that society, but as far as it may constitute individual guilt, which may be separated from the general guilt of the parties to the general plan, that is another consideration. 
GARROW 1196 Did you print the number ordered 
GARROW 1198 How soon did you print them 
GARROW 1200 Did you know him before 
GARROW 1202 Were you a member of the society yourself

GARROW 1225 Were you present at the time these resolutions were proposed in the society
GARROW 1227 Was it on the day upon which the resolutions purport by Mr. Thelwall’s paper to be come to, that you went to the Globe tavern, or amonth after 
GARROW 1229 Look at the paper, and tell us whether it was January or February; is the date correct 
GARROW 1231 Then do you believe it was the 18th of January, and not the 18th of February, upon which you had the copy 
GARROW 1233 Have you any doubt of that 
GARROW 1235 When you returned again, was it to a private dinner or a public dinner of the society 
GARROW 1237 Was there any chairman at the dinner? did you see any person in the chair

GARROW 1290 “AT A GENERAL MEETING 
GARROW 1291 “ op THE« LONDON CORRESPONDING SOCIETY, “ Held at the Grose Tavern, Strand, “On MONDA Ythe on Day of JANUARY, “1794. 
GARROW 1292 “CITIZEN JOHN MARTIN, 1n THE CHAIR. 
GARROW 1293 he following Appress to the Prorte of Great Britain and Ireland, was read and agreed to. 
GARROW 1294 Cinzens, We find the nation involved im a war, by which, in the course of ONE Campaign, immense numbers of our countrymen have been slaughtered; a vast expense has been incurred, our Trade, Comterce and Manufactories, are almost de‘ stroyed, and many of our Manufacturers and Artists are ruined, and their families starving. o add to our affliction, we have reason to expect, that other taxes will soon be added to the intolerable load of imposts and impositions with which we are already overwhelmed; for the purpose of defraying the expenses which have been incurred, in a fruitless crusade, to re-establish the odious despotism of France. “When we contemplate the principles of this war, we confess ourselves to be umabke to approve of it, as a measure, either of justice or discretion; and if we are to form our calculation of the result, from what has already passed, we can only lock forward to defeat and the eternal disgrace of the British name. 
GARROW 1295 “ While we are thus engaged in an expensive and rumous and foreign war; our state at home is not less deplorable. 
GARROW 1296 “ We are every day told, by those persons who are interested in supporting the Corruption List, and an inmumerable Host of Sinecure Placemen, that the Constitution of England, is the perfection of human wisdom; that our laws (we should rather say, TaErr laws) are the perfection of justice; and that their Administration of those laws is so impartial and so ready, as to afford an equal remedy, both to the rich and to the poor; by means of which, we are said to be placed in a state of absolute freedom, and that our Rights and Liberties are so well secured to us as to render all invasion of them impossible. 
GARROW 1297 “ When we ask, how we enjoy these transcendant privileges; we are referred to MAGNA CHARTA, and the BILL of RIGHTS; and the glorious REVOLUTION in the ig 1688, is held out to us, as the bulwark of British liberty. 
GARROW 1298 “ Cit1zens; We have referred to Magna Charta, to the Bill of Rights, and to the Revolution, and we certainly do find that our ancestors did establish wise and wholesome laws: but we as certainly find, that, of the venerable Constitution of our ancestors, hardly a vestige remains. 
GARROW 1299 “ The only Chapters of the Great Charter, which are now in legal existence, are the 14th and 29th. 
GARROW 1300 he important provision of the 14th Chapter, runs thus: 
GARROW 1301 “A Freeman shall not be amerced for a smal! fault, but after the manner of the faut ; and for a great fault after the’ greatness thereof, saving to him his contenement ; and a Merchant likewise, saving to him his merchandize ; and any other’s villain than ours shall be likewise amerced, saving to him his wainage; And none of the said amerciaments shall be assessed, but by the oath of honest and lawful men of the Victnage.’ 
GARROW 1302 “ But by the usurped power of the judges, in assessing Fines (and what Fines !!) in the cases of Misdemeanor; this glorious Right of the Subject, of having these fines assessed by the Jury (the only possible protection from slavery and the vilest oppression), is unjustly fat infamously ravished from us. 
GARROW 1303 he provision of the 29th chapter, runs thus : 
GARROW 1304 “ «No Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his freehold, or liberties, or free customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any otherwise destroyed, nor we will not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land. We will sell to no man, we will not deny, or defer to any man, either justice or right.’ 
GARROW 1305 he various methods now in constant tice by which the benefits of this provision are totally defeated and destroyed, might induce us to suppose, that the GREAT CHARTER has been repealed ; if we did not assuredly know, that it is the fundamental basis of our constitution; which even the REAL representatives of the people (much less the miserable nominees of HELSTUNE and OLD SARUM) have not the right, nor (as we trust it will be found by experience) the POWER to repeal. Yet what do we find in practice? Unconstitutional and illegal INFORMATIONS EX OFFICIO, that 1s, the arbitrary will of the king's Attorney General, usurping the oflice of the ACCUSING Jury; and the interested oath of a vile common informer, with the judsment of as vile a common trading or pensioned justice, substituted in the room of our birthright, an impartial trial by our country. 
GARROW 1306 Add to this, that the exorbitant expense of judicial proceedings, the novel practice of arbitrarily and repeatedly annulling the vericts of Juries, and the dilatory practice of the courts, most openly and shamefully contradict the clause which forbids the denial, the delay, and the sale of justice, 
GARROW 1307 “ A man accused of Fetony (for which by the comnion law of England, his life and goods are forfeited) may be bailed on finding two sureties for forty pounds each; but upon a charge of MISDEMEANOUR by words only, bail to the amount of ONE. THOUSAND POUNDS has been demanded. 
GARROW 1308 “Upon conviction also, for such misdemeanour, enormous fines, long and cruel imprisonments unknown to our ancient laws, and unsanctioned by any new statutes, have of late (and but of late) been too frequently and too oppressively inflicted. And all this, although by this bill of rights it is declared, that ‘ excessive bail shall not be demanded, “nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.’ 
GARROW 1309 “ If we look to IRELAND we find that acknowledged privilege of the people, to meet for the support and protection of their rights and liberties, is attempted, by terror, to be taken away by a late infamous act of parliament: hilst titles of honour! No, but of dishonour, are lavished; and new sources of corruption opened, to gratify the greedy prostitution of those, who are the instruments of this oppression. 
GARROW 1310 “In SCOTLAND, the Wicked Hand of Power has been impudently exerted, without even the wretched formality of an act of Parliament, Magistrates have furcibly intruded into the peaceful and lawful meetings of Freemen; and, by force (not only without law, but against law), have, under colour of magisterial office, interrupted thcir deliberations, and prevented their association. 
GARROW 1311 he wisdom and good conduct of the 
GARROW 1312 BRITISH CONVENTION at Edinburgh, has been such, as to defy their bitterest enemies to name the law which they have broken ; notwithstanding which, their papers have been seized, and made use of as evidence against them, and many virtuous and meritorious individuals, have been, as cruelly as unjustly for their virtuous actions disgraced and destroyed by infamous and illegal sentences of transportation. And these unjust and wicked judgments have been executed with a rancour and malignity, never before known in this land; our respectable and beloved Fellow-citizens have been cast Fer TERED into Dungeons amongst felons in the Hulks, to which they were not sentenced. 
GARROW 1313 “ Citizens, We all approve the sentiments, and are daily repeating the words, for which these our respectable and valuable brethren are thus unjustly and inhumanly suffering. We too, associate in order to obtain a fair, free, and full representation of the ple in a house of real national representatives. Are we also willing to be treated as Fetons, for claiming this our inherent right, which we are determined never to forego but with om lives, and which none but thieves and traitors can wish to withhold from us? Consider, it is one and the same corrupt and corrupting influence which at this time domineers in Ireland, Scotland, and England. Can you believe that those who send virtuous Irishmen, and Scotchmen fettered with felons to Botany Bay, do not meditate and will not attempt to seize the first moment to send us after them? Or, if we had not just cause to apprehend the Same inhuman treatment; if instead of the most imminent danger, we were in perfect safety from it; should we not disdain to enjo any liberty or privilege whatever, in whi our honest Irish and Scotch brethren did not oquatly and as fully participate with us? Their cause then and ours is the same. And it is both our duty and our interest to stand or fall together. ‘The Irish parliament and the Scotch judges, actuated by the same English influence, have brought us directly to the point. There is no farther step beyond that which they have taken. We are at issue. We must now choose at once either liberty or slavery for ourselves and our posterity. Will you wait till BARRACKS are erected in every village, and till subsidized Hessians and Hanoveriais are upon us? 
GARROW 1314 “You may ask perhaps, by what means shall we seek redress ? 
GARROW 1315 “ We answer, that men ina state of civilized society are bound to seek redress of the puevances from the laws; as long as any reress can be obtained by the laws. But our common Master whom we serve (whose law is a law of liberty, and whose service is perfect freedom) has taught us not to expect to gather grapes from thorns, nor figs from thistles. We must have redress from our own laws and not from the laws of our plunderers, enemies, and oppressors, 
GARROW 1316 “ THERE IS NO REDRESS FOR A NATION CIRCUMSTANCED AS WE ARE, BUT IN A FAIR, FREE, AND FULL REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE. 
GARROW 1317 “ RESOLVED, that during the ensuing session of parliament, the general committee of this society do meet daily, for the purpose of watching the proceedings of the parliament and of the administration of the government of this country. And that upon the first introduction of any bill, or motion inimical to the liberties of the people, such as, for LANDING FOREIGN TROOPS IN GREAT-BRITAIN or IRELAND, for suspending the HABEAS CORPUS ACT, for proclaiming MARTIAL LAW, OR FOR PREVENTING THE PEOPLE FROM MEETING IN SOCIETIES for CONSTITUTIONAL INFORMATION, or any OTHER INNOVATION ofa similar nature, that, on any of these emergencies, the general committce shall issue summonses to the delegates of each division, and also to the secretarics of the different societies affiliated and corresponding with this society, forthwith to call a GENERAL CONVENTION of the PEUPLE, to be held at such place and in such a manner as shall be specified in the summons, for the purpose of taking such measures into their consideration.

GARROW 1379 That applies to the dinner at the Globe
GARROW 1381 In the division meeting could any person who chose to ask for a acket, without being introduced by a member as a visitor, obtain it3—No. 
GARROW 1382 Do you know Mr. Thelwall 
GARROW 1384 Look at this, and tell me whether you believe this to be his hand-writing (showing a letter ta the wiiness]
GARROW 1386 My lords, I will state the rounds on which we offer this letter as eviBence against the prisoner. We have already given evidence to prove that Mr. Thelwall was not only a member of the London Corresponding Society, but that in the publication of the resolutions passed at the anniversary meeting, and their toasts, he acted as the agent of the society. I now propose to read a letter of Mr. Thelwall’s, as a farther act of that agency. The letter purports to have contained several of these addresses ; it purports, and it will appear likewise by the proof, te have contained several seditious songs, stated to have been composed and sung by Mr. Thelwall at that meeting, which we allege to be another, perhaps a subordinate and inferior branch atthat conspiracy which was to bring all the constituent authorities in the country into contempt, so as to mature the public mind for that great change which we slate to have been the ultimate object of the society. We submit to your lordships, that any act of Mr. Thelwall’s, so in furtherance of this cunspiracy, is evidence against the defendant. It also gives an account of the state of the other affiliated societies in different parts of the world. I cannot state it better than in the language of the letter : London is not the only place that is alive: Scotland is full of liberty boys. Sheffield and many other towns are mentioned as being ina state of expectation for that great catastrophe which they all looked to about this period. 
MACDONALD 1393 To whom is the letter addressed ? 
GARROW 1394 Yo a person of the name. of Vellam. 
GARROW 1395 ft certainly is not in my power to judge of the anxiety of my learned friends about the consequences of producing this letter, except as that anxiety induces them to object to its being read. It appears, that they are appre hensive of the effect and tendency of this letter, because they have made all the observations that occurred to them on the effect and tendency of this letter; and I am sure they will do me the justice to believe, that I mean no offence to them when I say I cannot discern any thing that is not justly, to be described to be argument upon the effect and tendency of the letter, which is argument ta he addressed to the jury. We conceive it is fit to be received in evidence, in order to cons vince the jury that this was done as a part of the agency of ‘Thelwall. But if we are not able to make it out in that way, we insist that the publishing by a larger circle that which was ordered to be printed for general publication, is clear evidence, being in furtherance of the general conspiracy. 
GARROW 1396 My friends seem to suppose that they can limit the acts of those who are not at presentat the bar, for consideration to things done either by themselves or their express order. We are very much mistaken if that be the rule of law. We humbly apprehend, that without revious concert as to the particolar fact done A. A. not being then upon his trial, if B. should have done the act, having been proved before to be a party to the general conspiracy, to be carried into effect by divers means and various instruments, that it is fit to receive evidence of the acts of all the parties to that conspiracy, in furtherance of that generak design ; for instance, it is not required that, in order to give evidence, that a conspirator hired his horse at a particular place, the hirin of which would connect him with the general conspiracy, the ground having been made, it is not necessary to show that he, to the person then trying, had communicated that he meant to go there to hire a horse; but the fact of his having done it is an accession to the general purposes of the conspiracy. All the acts of these persons, limiting it to the objects of the conspiracy, not extending it to crimes of another dye or character, but i furtherance of the general design of the grad conspiracy, we insist, coming from whom they may, whether it be the party upon: trial, whether it be in consequence of the orders given by him, whether communieated before or after, are evidence receivable, subject undoubtedly to the observations to be made upon their greater or lesser effect. 
EYRE 1397 I confess I have great doubt myself whether this evidence ought to be admitted. 1 agree, that where several persons are proved to be engaged ir one general conspiracy, that all the transactions of that conspiracy by the different parfies, may and ought to be given in evidence ; and it is enough if the party accused at this time can be proved to be-privy to that general conspiracy ; for if that is proved, every thin that is done by the different parties concern: in it, must be also imputed to him asa ah of the transaction of that conspiracy. I understand this letter, it is nothing more than Mr. Thelwall’s account to a private friend, of a part which he had taken respecting this paper, and of his having composed songs. And I remember another passage in it, which is very material as against Thelwall, but, in Ty mind, should be reserved till it comes to the time when Thelwall’s own declarations come to be proper evidence. 
EYRE 1398 I doubt whether we ought to consider this Racal letter as any thing more than Mr. 
EYRE 1399 helwall’s declaration; and Thelwall’s declaration ought not to be evidence of any thing which, si remotely connected with this plot, yet still does not amount to any transaction done in the course of the plot, for the furtherance of the plot, but is a mere recital of his, a sort of confession of his of some part that he had taken. It appearsto me, that that is not like the evidence which we before admitted of a fact done by Mr. Thelwall in carrying the papers and delivering them to the printer, which is a part of the transaction itself. His account of that transaction seems to me to stand quite upon a different footing. It seems just the same as an act which shall bind a man, because he is connected with the person that did the act; and his declaration, which shall not bind him, because it is no part of the act. 
GARROW 1400 He says, “ You will also receive enclosed several copies of Addresses published by the society. It is upon that 
GARROW 1401 ‘ound I submit it to your lordship. 
EYRE 1402 To be sure, as far as the transmission of these papers go, it does stand upon another footing; but I should be sorry if the letter was to be read for so immaterial a purpose, as that is only to introduce something which in my mind ought not to be evidence in this case. 
GROSE 1405 I must confess, I have very great doubts upon this subject. The majority of the cuurt is for rejecting the evidence. It does seem to me, I must confess, at least very doubtful whether it ought to be rejected; for it appears to me, that this is evidence of what the parties meant by whag was done at a place where both these parties were present, and both members of one society, and professedly concerned in one plan; it is therefore very material to hear what either of them says respecting this plan, for there is mo doubt about it that these papers are respecting this plan, to show the extent of the plan, and the intention, the animus with which these rele met, and were publishing these papers; therefore, in ‘that light, I must confess, what my brother Buller has said has struck me very much. But, exdlusive of that, from the beginning ‘the inclination of my opinion was and is, that it is evidence. 
MACDONALD 1406 It is certainly a case that has a great dead of doubt attending it; but at the same time I can hardly bring my own mind to consider this as falling within Mr. Garrow’s own definition. It must be something in furtherance of the conspiracy. I agree, that any act done by one, is, to a certain extent, imputable to another; that is, it may be given in evidence to show the general conspiracy in which ‘he was engaged; but an act done, appears to me to be different from the mere relation of it by another person, a mere relation of what passed given by one in a private letter to another. I have much doubt whether it is evidence that ought to be received. 1 am, myselt, inclined to reject it. 
HOTHAM 1407 I am of the same oinion as my lord chief justice and my lord cief baron. I do not think this is evidence fit to be received. I do not think itisa partthe transaction of the plan to be carried into execution. I consider it as a mere relation of what has passed, which, if it is to affect the prisoner, ought to be confined to the real fact that happened at the time to which this relation alludes. Llowever, there is no evidence to prove that what is stated for a fact in this letter, by which the prisoner is to be implicated, actually did happen. 
EYRE 1408 After having heard my lord chief baron and my brothers upon it, I really am of opinion thatt is too questionable to received as evidence, except upon the ground last stated by Mr. Garrow, upon which (if he insists on it) it must be received. 
GARROW 1409 Certainly not. 
EYRE 1410 In the cases of Dammarce and lord George Gordon, the cry of the mob at the time made a part of the fact, of the transaction, therefore I have no doubt that such evidence ought to be received ; but I confess I have so great a doubt upon the admissibility of this letter, that I prefer 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1411 My lord, I should have no idea of pressing this, but mercly with a view to similar questions which may arise.. 
EYRE 1413 Correspondence Mid often makes a part of the transaction, and where correspondence makes a part of the transaction, the correspondence of one man who is a party in a conspiracy, would undoubtedly be evidence, correspondence in furtheranee of the plot: a correspondence of a private nature, a mere relation of what had been done, appears a different thing. 
GARROW 1414  
GARROW 1415 lord, I now proj to Jead a letter upon the principle of Nes Wan & 
GARROW 1416 correspondence between one of the persons proved to have been a party in the conspiracy, and another person at a distant part of t kingdom, likewise proved to be a party in the conspiracy: it is a letter from Mr. Martin, after the dinner at the Globe tavern, to Mr. Margarot, who was at that time in custody in the Tolbooth, at Edinburgh, having been one of the persons apprehended by the magistracy at Edinburgh, as a part of that British Convention whom the magistracy dispersed. The letter is in terms calculated to excite the spirit of the brethren of the North: it hkewise contains a declaration of the universal approbation of the conduct of those delegates in the North, and it states other circumstances of a public nature; the maner in which his majesty had met Ais parliament, as it is stated —the manner in which his majesty is stated by this writer to have been received by the people, and insulted, and his life endangered, as this writer states it, still poing on with a view to excite and encourage them in a distant part of the kingdom, by disseminating the same doctrines, which, in .London, these people disseminated. 
GARROW 1420 Davison proved that he was a member 
GARROW 1428 It is a letter addressed to Margarot, at Edinburgh, he being a misSionary from this society. 
EYRE 1429 Where was it found ? what is the fact? 
WHITE 1430 It was not found among his yers, but we shall prove it to be Martin’s hand-writing. 
GARROW 1435 It was stated to be an excitaYon in terms. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1439 I will trouble your lordship with a very few words upon this point, and, I trust, your lordship will be of opinion that it is unquestionably evidence. Certain persons are indicted for endeavouring to procure a Convention to be assembled to subvert the legislature, rule and government, now duly ani happily established in this kingdom, and other overt-acts of the same tendency. Now upon the very Eencivs which has been just stated by Mr. Gibbs, it appears to me that this is evidence. The principle which is stated by Mr. Gibbs is, that that, which is declared by conspirators, whilst in action, is evidence against those who were not presentat the time, as well as against those who were present at the time. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1441 I am very - litle capable of distingutahing between whatstated and what Mr. Gibbs now says. I take this to be a declaration of conspirators in the progress of their conspiracy, and I take that to be exactly the distinction between this case, and that which your lordships have determined, with respect to which it is my duty to submit to the judgment of the Court. That was a letter addresscd to a person, whom we have not shown to be, in any degree, involved in the conspiracy, to a Mr. Vellam; whereas this is a letter, addressed by Mr. Martin, who is proved to be chairman of the meeting on the 20th of January, to Maurice Margarot, who was the deputy froty the Corresponding Society, at the Convention which was held at Edinburgh; itis, therefore, a conversation, by letter, between two persons who were parties to the conspiracy, if there existed any conspiracy ; for, in all these cases, the first question your lordships and the jury will have to consider, is the existence of a conspiracy, and the object of that conspiracy ; and then, whether the person charged was party to that conspiracy. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1442 Now for the purpose of showing the existence of a conspiracy, and for the purpose of showing what the views of the conspirators were, bow far they went, conversations of those conspirators totally distinct from the prisoner, have constantly been admitted to be iven in evidence. In the case of my lord Stafford, which was a prosecution, by impeachment in parliament, for high treason, in compassing the death of the king, and proceeding to great length; the evidence that was first given was simply, and only of the general plot, by persons who were capable, as they afterwards proved by their testimony, of bringing that treason specifically home to lord Stafford; they were not examined to that point at first, but were examined simply, and only to the general plot; one thing which may proved in the course of that evidence, with respect to the general plot, I will state to your lordships; it was a discourse between Anderton, Campion, Green, and several other persons, with which lord Stafford had no sort of connexion whatever, in which those persons told the witness, that there would be a great alteration in England ere long; that the king was an heretic, and might be destroyed; that they industriously preached this doctrine, and that the duke of York was with them. Evidence was iven of these conversations. Who were e persons that held these conversations? They were not persons included in the impeachment of lord Stafford, but persons to whom it was imputed that they were in the common and general conspiracy, which was cbarged to exist, for .the purpose of the restoration of the Roman Catholic religion in this country, and for the purpose of deposing the king, and subverting the government of the country. The manner in which serjeant Maynard states the evidence which was to be given, seems to me to be perfectly clear. He says, “ This is a treason of a faction, and of a general party in the nation : it is not this or that lord, but a great pumber; itis not this or that lord that is mentioned in the articles, but the conee is of a great faction. This do we ink, and this makes us so earnest to press the general before your lordships, that we may give satisfaction to your lordships, and the world, what this plot hath been, and how carried on every where. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1443 My lords, the consequence of that is very t; for, my lords, if there were a general lesign, and a general plot, as clearly there was, some were to act in Spain, and some in France; some in other places; some in Ireland, Scotland, and England, and a great number of jesuits (we have a matter of hiny in chase about this business)I say, my lords, if it be so, if one action be in one place, and another in another, yet if there be a common consent to accomplish this plot, then what the one dves is the act of all, and the act of all is the act of every one. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1444 “ My lords, the persons were many, and the places and times many they acted in, and the designs which they were to accomplish and the means wherewith they were to accomplish them were many tou. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 1445 My lords, in the case of lord Lovat, the same sort of doctrine is laid-down with respect to the evidence
SOLICITORGENERAL 1447 This was said upon an objection that was taken to the evidence of Mr. Murray, of Broughton
SOLICITORGENERAL 1449 With submission to your lordships, this letter is evidence upon the same ground
ADAIR 1451 It is not on account Of the importance of this particular piece of evidence that I take the liberty of addressing a very few words to your lordships, upon the subject of the objection that has bcen made, but from an impression of the very great importance of the principle upon which this obJection may be decided, and the extensive application of it to other cases that may in future occur, 
ADAIR 1452 In order to understand the objection, it is necessary to state the ground upon which this evidence is offered: and I conceive that a reat part of the argument of my learned iend, who very ingeniously stated this objection at first, is answered by a cunsideration of the ground upon which this evidence is offered ; for I do not conceive, and I, for one, do not offer the evidence to the Court upon the ground, that the idle expressions of 
ADAIR 1453 Mr. Martin respecting the king,—that the relation of an accidental fact that happened im the Park, within Mr. Martin's knowledge, respecting the king, is any evidence at all against the prisoner; but it is upon this ground, that a part of that letter which we offer in evidence is alleged to relate, and your lordships, when it is read, will find that it does relate to an act done by the conspirators, as itis contended, in the furtherance and prosecution of that conspiracy which is by the indictment imputed to the prisoner. 
EYRE 1454 Be so good as state a little more particularly what that is. 
ADAIR 1455 It is a statement from one of the conspirators, who had been in the chair at the meeting of those whom we call the conspirators, held, as it has been alleged, for the purpose of furthering the views of that conspiracy—it is a statement of that conspirator to another person, alleged to be a conspirator, of what fees at that mecting, so held
ADAIR 1457 The grounds upon which this evidence ig offered to the Court, seem to me to fall directly within the principle of lord Stafford’s case; but, even f it eould be distinguished from other cases, I think it cannot be distinguished from the cases of Dammaree and lord 
ADAIR 1458 3eorge Gordon ; and the distinction that has been attempted between an act of violence, or any other act, in furtherance ofa conspiracy, FE confess I do not feel much the force of. — This comes so completely within the principle of lord George Gordon's case, that it is impossible, without holding that case net to be law, to reject this evidence. 
ADAIR 1459 Your lordships will pardon me for having made these observations ; it was merely from the importance of the principle, and not from the least idea that the letter, when read, will be thought to be very much in itself. 
BEARCROFT 1460 I make no apology for troubling your lordships with a few observations upon this point; it is a case of ve great imjortance; and when I say that, I am sure I shall be understood, that I do not stand up to speak of the importance of it, because I am likely to give any extraordinary assistance, but, inasmuch as it is of so great and general importance, I, therefore, feel it m: duty to attempt to do it in the best way can
BEARCROFT 1462 —I will not attempt to break into, or controvert, the rule that has been already laid down by the Court, as I understand it—I will not repeat a syllable that has been said b the learned gentleman before me—but I thin: I can add another observation upon this letter, which would entitle it to be read. 
BEARCROFT 1463 When I say I will not controvert the rule Jaid down, as I understand it, I wish to state, in order that I may be corrected if I misunderstand it, how I suppose it to have been laid down,—as I understand it, it was decided, by the authority of the Court, that a mere narration of simple facts that have passed is not admissible evidence; I think that cannot well be disputed ; my humble judgment certainly goes with that decision, if it is carried no farther; but when a question of evidence, and of great extent and iniportance, is befure the Court, I have been always taught, that the way to decide upon the competency and admissibility of that evidence is to consider,— What is the question trying 
BEARCROFT 1465 Now I understand, or I am grossly mistaken in the whole of this proceeding, that the object of it is to show, that the prisoner at the aris guilty of high treason, of the species chargedin this indictment, by the means, and by overt acts, which amount to a conspiracy, with many others, to carry that treasonable intent into execution; that is the nature of the charge
BEARCROFT 1467 Now, my lords, I take it to be a settled rule in the trial of an indictment for a conspiracy of every kind, that when once you have established, that the prisoner at the bar has conspired together with others, not then upon trial, in the indictment—nay I go farther, not charged in the indictment : When I sa: established, Ido not mean established decidedly, that they are guilty of the conspiracy, but that there is evidence admissible, and to be laid before the jury, upon which they are to exercise their judgment—then I have a right to give in evidence the acts of others, so connected. 
BEARCROFT 1468 My lord, it cannot he disputed, that some evidence to prove the conspiracy is in the possession of the Court; nay, it is in the possession of the jury; for it cannot be in possession of the Court, without being in possession of the jury; they have heard it, of ; course, as it has been admitted
BEARCROFT 1470 been rightty stated by Mr. Solicitor General. 
BEARCROFT 1471 What is the object of the conspiracy 
BEARCROFT 1473 I beg leave to advert to another part of this letter, that, I say, goes pointedly to show, that the design was for compassing the mischievous, the traitorous,—I had very nearly said the personal destruction of the king. What I advert to in this letter, I will read te our lordships in the very words : “ The 
BEARCROFT 1474 ‘ing went yesterday to meet Ais parliament. Your lordships will mark the expression; it is very decent, but— 
EYRE 1476 The interruption is not quite proper : because, if it were so, that my brother Adair had distinctly admitted it in that manner, yet that could not conclude the argument of another learned gentleman, if he was of opinion he could maintain it. 
EYRE 1479 No; only so 'y to inform the Court of the nature of it. 
ADAIR 1482 As my friend has done me the honour to advert more to what fell from me than the weight of it seemed to deserve, I heg leave to state and explain what I did say upon the subject. I did state, and I do not mean to retract it, that the part of the letter which I alluded to, when 1 spoke, was not the ground upon which we offered it to P ha lordships, and would not, of itself, Make that evidence against the prisoner; but I did never state, that if there was that in the letter, upon the ground of which I contended it was proper evidence, as applicable evidence to the charge against the prisoner, that the whole context of that letter should not be taken together, in order to show the intention of the parties who are implicated in that design. I have never admitted that. But his lordship has certainly truly said, that my admission does not preclude any other gentleman arguing upon that ground. I wished to repeat what it was that I did state, that I might not be accused of having admitted that which I never admitted. 
BEARCROFT 1483 I have received this interruption with the greatest patience, because it is made by a counsel for a man now trying for his life; if it had been made in any other place, and ina civil cause, I could not have orborne instantly to express my astonishment at the gross irregularity of the interruption ; because I conceive it is not only the privilege, but it is absolutely the duty of a counsel, when he is arguing upon the admissibility of evidence, to state that evidence to the Court. If, it can, by any other means, be argued, my learned friend will be so good as tell me how that is to be performed, for I really cane not conceive. 
EYRE 1484 The counsel is to open the nature of the evidence. 
BEARCROFT 1486 I am certainly aware, that it may be done in that shape of opening the nature of the evidence; but with great submission to the Court, I conceive that was precisely what I was going to do. I do conceive, with great deference, that it would be extremely improper in me to be reading the evidence, from the beginning to the end, under colour that that should be necessary to argue as to the admissibility of it. I de adanit, that it is sufficient; nay, that more ought not to be done than to state the nature of it; but I conceive that the nature of that part of it, which I point out as one of the main grounds of the admissibility of this letter, are certain particular expressions made use of in it. What strikes me, at this moment, is [contained in two lines and a half : “ Nay, I am told a woman, moved and seduced by the instigation of the devil, and traitorously intending, &c. did, in St. James’s- park, take off her patten, and threw it, with all her force, whereby the glass of the state coach was broken, and his majesty put in fear. God save the king; for, if, &c. as Gerrald says,— Be acl y do submit to the Court, that this is important evidence to the very point of the indictment; namely, for the pu se of showing a mischievous intention to the king. Because this is a letter from one of the conspirators to another of the conspirators, exulting in the transaction, enjoying it, and stating it as good news, for his purpose, to his brother conspirator. That is the light, with great submission, in which it strikes me. I conceive that that is an additional ground upon which this letter is admissible. 
BOWER 1487 I should be ashamed to trouble the court with a word Ls this objection, for the sake of the piece of evidence that is now in my hand, because it does not appear, of itself, to be of so much importance as to demand so much attention ; but it will be of very considerable consequence in the course of these trials, if a piece of evidence, offered to the court under the circumstances in which we offer this letter, should not be considered, as good evidence. 
BOWER 1488 I will attend to what your lordship su gested, that the duty of counsel is to open the tendency of the evidence, at the time it is offered and objected to; and, with great deference to my friends who have gone before me, I do not think that they have opened the tendency of that part of this letter, which appears to me to be material, and to be an indisputable ground why it should be received in evidence. 
BOWER 1489 I must beg your lordships to advert to the state of the present cause. We have already proved, as against the pooner, a paper, signed with the name of John Martin, as chairman, at a meeting of the society of which he himself is secretary. This paper was brought home to him by evidence, and by etnch, he, therefore, admits, that Martin was the chairman of that meeting; the date of the letter, which I hold in my hand, is the 22d of January, 1794; it is subsequent to the period of that convention in Scotland, of which we have heard so much, and it is relative to that convention. ‘The letter which I want to read now is from Mr. Martin, who we have proved to be so connected with Mr. Hardy, to their delegate in Scotland, who was at that time, in consequence of the interposition of the civil magistrate, in confinement, as it appears, to encourage him to proceed in these efforts, which he was sent there to attempt, by telling him that subscriptions will now be raised, which will be an assistance to him, and by informing hiim that it may be thought advisable to have another meeting here, in a commodious place, for the purpose of carryin into effect the views of the convention, which the magistracy of that country interrupted. That is the tendency of the greatest part of the letter, which we now offer to the Court; and if we have brought ourselves into the situation of showing, as I trust we have, that Mr. Hardy has admitted Mr. Martin to be chairman of the Corresponding Society ; if we have proved that the object of that society was to accomplish certain purposes; when I say we have proved, I take it we have given evidence to prove it; if we have proved, that the objects of that society were, to carry certain purposes into effect, by means of the convention ; if we show incitement from a person proved to be connected with the prisoner in the way Martin has been proved, to proceed in those steps which are the objects of that convention, and to persevere in those measures, which were the measures used to bring about the ultimate purposes of that convention, we may prove a direct act, done in furtherance of that conspiracy, by showing a direct incitement, by a Jetter in the very words of the overt act charged in this indictment, to persevere, and go on with that conduct, which was to lead to the ultimate end that the society had in view. 
EYRE 1490 I understand that this letter is not proved ever to have come to the hands of Margarot; you call ita letter; it is, in truth, merely a paper, in Martin’s hand-writing. 
BOWER 1491 The argument would, perhaps, be stronger, if it had come to his hands ; but, with great submission to your lordship, it is evidence of the intent of this Mr. Martin to encourage the party, who appears to have been intended to have been addressed by this letter, in the general purposes for which this society has been established, and which they were going to carry into effect; but it is not so strong, to be sure, as if I could prove that it arrived at Margarot’s possession, because, I take it, that would put it out of all doubt; but any letter, written from a conspirator in the connexion we have proved Mr. Martin to be, having proved him to be chairman of that very meeting, the object of this letter being to persevere in these measures, and to forward those purposes, which we have proved the society had in view, and that Martin, the man who writes this letter, particularly had in view, by the transactions at the Globe tavern, is not, I conceive, a recital of any thing that has passed, but a direct incitement to go on with that act, which we are about to prove, as being the act intended by this society to be carried into effect, by the joint or individual efforts of the members of the society. It does appear to me to be material, that we should now know whether or no, when we have established an intimate connexion between Martin and the prisoner, that an act done by Martin, in direct furtherance and prosecution of the main design, should not be admitted as evidence against the prisoner, though we have given evidence, that they were connected in the individual and particular act which is the subject of the evidence that has been offered. I submit to your lordships, that this is evidence which, in this stage of the cause, ought to be received; and it is not for the materiality of this piece of evidence, but for the sake of the principle that we wish to have established. 
LAW 1492 The ground upon which I meant to address your lordships has been, ina great degree, anticipated by what has fallen from Mr. 
LAW 1493 wer
LAW 1495 Then what is this act? And is it an act: which falls within any of the overt-acts charged upon the face of the indictment
LAW 1497 letter: the only question is, whether such a letter as that, of which it may be predicated, that it contains an exhortation and incitement to this object, is or not to be received in evi dence. I conceive there can be no doubt it is an excitement and exhortation upon this subject, and if it be that it is ad«issible. 
EYRE 1506 This has e into a length of discussion ; butIblame nobody, as there was some differenoe of opinion in the Court upoa the former occasion ; therefore it required that this question should be more fully discussed. 
EYRE 1507 I agree with Mr. Bearcroft, that he has stated truly what the nature of this questian is; namely, that if this were merely a trial for a conspiracy, this would be evidence against one of the parties in that conspiracy, because the question, whether this prisoner is to be reached upon the apecific charge against him, is, undoubtedly, a question, whether he is to be reached -by that medium; aad if the medium is once established, that question arises, upon which I will say no more at presant. 
EYRE 1508 It is perfectly clear that in the case of a Conspiracy, the general evidence of she thing canspired is given in evidence, and then the party who is at present brought before a court of justice to answer for it is to be affected for his shase in it; the question then is, whether a paper under the hand of a person, who is proved to be one of the conspirators, shall be Teceived in evidence, where it ts nothing more ban a paper under his hand? For, as I take Ht, as this case stands, it is not a letter sent to Margarot. There is no preef that Margarot nd recerve any such agen pe aia it may be a paper merely writtem pri ly Martin, who is the person im whose hapdquestion This is of the nature of confession, and writing it is stated to be, and may never have gone out of his hands. The question is, wher ther under these circumstances such a paper is to be admitted in evidence, ina case in which another person pow stands at the bar; and, I confess, that this does not appear to me to be suffidently distinguished from the case which we just now determined, o satisfy my mand that it ought to be received in evidence. 
EYRE 1509 It is undoubtedly true, that the general plot is to be made out by proving the transactions of others, to which the prisoner at the bar may not be immediately a pers but thea, bow is itto be proved? Is it to be proved by the mere acknowledgment of theac other parties, end so made use of against the prisoner now at the bar? For instance, here isa conspiracy charged. Sup; & witness should come and say, J heard Thelwall sey that he was engaged i auch a cons| : and I heard Martin say he was engaged im such a conspiracy ; endIheard Margaret say he was engaged io mich a conspiracy. My present apprehension is, that that would be extremely good evidence personally against the parties, who said it to prove against them individually, that they were cnncerned in that conspiracy, but that it would be no evidence whatever agaiast third persons, a8 was the case on ford StaGord’s trial. A witness praved that he heard A. B. and C. converse upen the subject ofa conspiracy; that is a direct proof that ahese three persons conspired, and there the conversation of que is evidence against the ether, and so on; that is evidence of a transaction, a fact, not hear-say evidence; and not evidence of a party’s acknowledgment, oaly inasmuch as it is an acknowledg. ment by one in the presence of the others, they acquiescing, and therefore becomes distinct and proper evidence. Sut I have ala ways taken it that with regard to these persanal acknowledgments of having meant to in. citey—for that isthe nature of this letter—J have always taken it that that was proper evidence, if the party who was to be affected by it happened to stand at the bar to answer for it: but if another person was indicted by himself, that there could be no evidence received against that person, but the evideace of facts proved by the witnesses, who peeve the existence of the facts in regular evidence: confessional evidence is ad hominem only. Lfit happens that a matter of fact is evidence against A, by evidence of the truth of that fact, other thay the confession of A, that does also become evidence against B, from the circumstance of B being connected ee the plot, and B being bound by al! that A has done. But the course that has been observed in the Stade Trials that I have read, bas been that confessions have been made evidemes against the individuals only who confessed. Bow thing more; that has been considered as evi. dence only against the party, and is not te bo received where that party is not the person before the Court. 
MACDONALD 1510 On the last question before the Court I confined what I said to the exact circumstance of the case, namely, that the bare relation of acts by one of several persons to whom the conspiracy is imputed to a perfect stranger to that conspiracy, is no more than an admission which may possibly affect himself, but cannot possibly affect any of his co-conspirators, it not being an act done in the prosecution of that conspiracy. But, I confess, there appears to me a material distinction in this case. This is a paper which is addressed by one of several conspirators to another of those conspirators; it is introduced as subservient to the proof of the general nature and tendency of that conspiracy, which is alleged and endeavoured to be proved as the foundation of affecting the prisoner with a share in that conSpiracy. 
MACDONALD 1511 Now it seems to me that one conspirator addressing a paper to another conspirator, having relation to that conspiracy (not merely a bare description to a stranger), that one of them addressing that paper to the other is an act complete in that single conspirator, although that paper should be intercepted, or although it never should reach that person for whose perusal it was intended; that distinguishes this from the other case ; it is a different act in one, though it does not reach the other in that sense; it is an act by one of the conspirators, which in order to show the nature and tendency of that conspiracy may be read as against any other. 
HOTHAM 1512 I remain of opinion that in the last case, the letter then offered in evidence ought not to have been suffered to be read. That letter, however, I consider as a very different letter from this; it was enclosing some songs, supposed to have heen sung at a meeting, sent to a totally indifferent person, and that was all that it contained. This letter is written by a man who has been proved to be the chairman of the meeting at the Globe-tavern ; it is stated to be written to, though not received by, Margarot, who has been proved to be the delegate sent by that meeting into Scotland ; and it is stated to contain matters respecting his particular mission to Edinburgh. It 1s stated to contain matters of incitement, and encouragement to him to proceed in the cause in which he was engaged ; namely, in the cause in which he was engaged by the procurement, by the consent, and by the direction of that meeting in 
HOTHAM 1513 London; and that meeting in London has been proved to be composed of the prisoner at the bar, of the writer of this letter, and his correspondent to whom it was intended to be sent, together with many others. 
HOTHAM 1514 Now, therefdre, I do consider this as strong evidence, to show that one of that meeting so blended together as they are with the prisoner, :e such a letter tending to incite and encourage their own delegate to proceed in the business, upon which they had particularly sent him, and for which they had especially commissioned him and empowered him to act, ought to be admitted as evidence to prove the sense of these conspirators, who were also proved to have been together upon that day. 
GROSE 1517 I am of opinion this evidence must be received for the purpose of showing that there was a conspiracy, and of what nature that conspiracy was. In this case the address has just now been produced and read; and in that address it appears that Martin was the chairman, the prisoner the secretary, and that there was a correspondence, both between the prisoner and Margarot, and between Martin and Margarot; that complicates or implicates these three persons in a business of this sort. Then is it not very material for us to hear for the purpose of showing the nature of the conspiracy, the extent and the intention of the parties, what one conspirator writes to the uther, respecting these very acts that are done in the course of transactions relative to this very plan? And when itis said that this is merely aconfession ora writing, I think it is more because we know very well that in many circumstances of this sort it has been determined that, scribere est agere ; and the writing here isan act, and it is such ap act as may show the extent of the plan, that there was a plan, it may show for any thing I know the intention of the parties to that plan. I confess, therefore, I am of opinion that this evidence ought to be read.

If ever a crisis arrived that required the exertions of the people to stop the torrent of corruption, infamy, and despotism that seems likely to overwhelm them, it is the present. In God’s name, ther, let us use these exertions. We are called upon by every thing that is dear to us, as men and as Christians. The cause of truth and liberty must finally be omnipotent; therefore doubt not that the glorious reign of liberty and equality will ere Jong be established; and modern governments, with every appen of wickedness and corruption, will flee, in time, from their genial influence, as beasts of prey to their dens of rapine and darkness from the rising sun. The London Corresponding Society have beheld with indignation the rapid advances of despotism in Britain, and are ready cordially to unite with every other society in the three kingdoms, who have for their object a full and effectual sg ae tion of the people; they therefore have deputed six of their members to meet six of the members of the Society for Constitutional Information, to form a committee of correspondence and co-operation. This committee meets regularly twice a week, at No. 2, Beaufort Buildings, Strand, where any member delegated by your society will meet with every information required. We inclose you a few of our resolutions entered into at our general meeting, on the 14th of April, which will be sufficiently explanatory of ovr sentiments and views.

GARROW 1601 Mr. Erskine. The principle upon which the last piece of evidence was admitted was vel distinctly stated by your lordships, that it might be evidence to show a conspiracy so called, yet would not go to affect the prisoner, unless it could be brought home to him. The only remark I make upon this is, how does it appear to be the same Sheffield Society with which this society was in correspondence? Is it written in the same hand-writing? Does it profess to be written by the same person who betore corresponded with the prisoner? Mr. Garrow. We do not state this is the Sheffield society with which they correpanded; I state it to be from a society at Sheffield, with which town they were in correspondence, signed by a person purporting to be a secretary ; but if my friends object to it, we will not trouble them to argue it. 
EYRE 1603 I think this letter is iy a different situation from the other. It is a Jetter purporting to come from one of these societies ; it is addressed to the prisoner, and it is found in the hands of a person affected by the evidence, at least to involve him in this conspiracy.

BOWER 1667 “ Resolved, That the secretary wait on Mr. Paine, to be informed by him, whether it be agrecable to him, that the two resolutions of the committee appointed to take Mr. Paine’s letter of the 4th of July into consideration, weer with the answer of the society, be published in the papers, and that if Mr. Paine does not disapprove its publication, that it be forthwith published in different papers. 
BOWER 1668 “ Adjourned to the last Friday in September. ,

BOWER 1682 Have you ever talked with him about those notes, or of things that were sent in consequence 
BOWER 1684 Did you publish, at any time, for Mr. Paine, a work, intituled, “ Rights of Man

BOWER 1688 Do you believe it to be one of the books that you published 
BOWER 1692 Look at it, and see whether it is one of the books pa published 
EYRE 1695 Who printed it
BOWER 1697 I thought you had been the printer 
WHITE 1699 The man is dead that bought it, and I must call a witness to prove hi hand-writing. That was proved in a court of justice. 
BOWER 1700 I have the record of a conviction, in which Paine was convicted: this witness was examined upon his oath there, and I can prove what he swore then, which I submit will be evidence. 
GARROW 1702 I think I am entitled, at present, to read this as evidence to go to the jury ; I know it is open to the other side to show that this is not the Rights of Man reeognized by this society

BOWER 1712 “ Sir; The London Corresponding Society having taken the resolution of transmitting to the French National Convention, an address, signed by all the members, or by the different delegates (each stating for how many members he signs), to assure that suffering nation, that we sympathise with them in their misfortunes ; that we view their exertions with admiration ; that we wish to give them all such countenance and support as individuals, unsupported and oppressed themselves, can afford; and that should those in power here—dare (in vivlation of the nation’s pledged faith of neutrality, and in opposition to the well-known sentiments of the people at large) to join the German band of despots, united against liberty, we disclaim all concurrence therein; and will, to a man, exert every justifiable. means for counteracting their machinations against the freedom and happiness of uankind. 
BOWER 1713  am ordered by the committee to acquaint the Society for Constitutional Infor-mation therewith, in order to be favoured with their opinion thereon, and in hopes that, if they approve the idea, and recommend its adoption to the different societies, the publication of such a respectable number of real names will greatly check the hostile measures which might otherwise be put in execution.

GARROW 1730 Letter of Thomas Paine, to the People of France. Published and distributed gratis by the London Corresponding Society. 
GARROW 1731 “ Paris, September 25. (First Year of the Republic.) 
GARROW 1732 “ Fellow Citizens; I receive, with affectionate Eratitade, the honour which the late National Assembly has conferred upon me, by adopting me a citizen of France; and the ditional honour of being elected by my fellow-citizens a member of the National Convention. Happily impressed, as I am, by those testimonies of respect shown towards me as an individual, I feel my felicity increased by seeing the barrier broken down that divided patriotism by spots of earth, and limited citizenship to the soil, like vegetation. 
GARROW 1733 “Had those honours been conferred in an hour of national tranquillity, they would have afforded no other means of showing my affection, than to have accepted and enjoyed them ; but they come accompanied with circumstances that give me the honourable portunity of commencing my citizenship in the stormy hour of difficulties. I come not to enjoy repose. Convinced that the cause of France is the cause of all mankind, and that as liberty cannot be purchased by a wish, I gladly share with you the dangers and honours necessary to success. 
GARROW 1734 “1 am well aware that the moment of any inp change, such as that accomplished on the 10th of August, is unavoidably the moment of terror and confusion, The mind, highly agitated by hope, suspicion, and apprehension, continues without rest till the change be accomplished. But let us now look calmly and confidently forward, and success is certain. It is no longer the paltr cause of kings, or of this, or of that individual, that calls France and her armies into action. It is the great cause of aru. Itis the establishment of a new era, that shall blot despotism from the earth, and fix, on the lasting principles of peace and citizenship, the great republic of man. 
GARROW 1735 t:has been my fate to have borne a share in the commencement and complete establishment of one revolution (I meafi the revolution of America). The success and events of that revolution are encouraging to us. The ey. and ianpinesy: sat have since jowed to that country, have amply rewarded her for all the hardships she endured, and for all the dangers she encountered. 
GARROW 1736 “ The principles on which that revolution began, -have extended themselves to Europe ; and an over-ruling Providence is repesereing the Old World by the principles of the New. The gah ere Som a Asse other pats of , did not admit of her carrying those principles beyond her own situation. It 1s to the peculisr honour of France, that she now raixes the seumiard of liberty for all nations; and in fighting hes own battles, contends for the rights of all mankind. 
GARROW 1737 he same spirit of fortitude that insured success to America, will insure it to France, for it is impossible to conquer a nation determined to be free! The military circumstances that now unite themselves to France, are suc! as the despots of the earth know nothing of, and can’ form no caleulation upon know not what it is to fight: against a nation, They have only been accustomed to make war’ upon each other, and they know from systeny and practice, how to calcilate the probable success of despot against despot; and here’ their knowledge and their experience ends. 
GARROW 1738 “ But in a contest like the present, a new and boundless variet yer circumstances arises, that deranges all such customary calculations. When: a whole nation acts as an army, the despot knows not the extent of the power against which he contends. New armies rise’ against him with the necessity of the moment. It is then that the difficulties of an-invading enemy multiply, as in the former case they diminished ; and he finds them at their height when he expected them to end. 
GARROW 1739 he only war that has any mouarity oF circumstances with the present, is the late revolution-war in America. Qa her part, as it now is in France, it was a war of the whole nation
GARROW 1741 “ Were it now to be proposed to the Austrians and Prussians to escort them into the middle of France, and there leave them to make the most of such a situation, they would see too much into the danger of it to accept the offer, and the same dangers would attend them could they arrive there by any other means. Where then is the military policy of their attempting to obtain by force, that which they would refuse by choice? But to reason with despots is throwing reason away. The best of arguments is a vigurous preparation. 
GARROW 1742 “Man is ever a stranger to the ways by which Providence regulates the order of things. The interference of foreign despots may serve to introduce into their own enslaved countries the principles they come to oppose, Liberty and equality are blessings too great to be the inheritance of Frauce alone. It is honour to her to be their first champion ; and she may now say to her enemies, with a mighty voice, ‘O! ye Austrians, ye Prus‘slans! ye who now turn your bayonets “against us; it is for all Europe; it is tor alt mankind, and not for France alone, that sho “raises the standard of Liberty and Equality. 
GARROW 1743 he public cause has hitherto suffered from the contradictions contained in the constitution of the former Constituent Assembly. Those contradictions have served to divide the opinions of individuals at home, and to obscure the great principles of the revolution in other countries. But when those contradictions shall be removed, and the constitution be made conformable to the declaration of rights; when the bagatelles of monarghy, royalty, regency, and hereditary succession, shall be exposed, with all their absurdities, a new ray of light will be thrown over the world, and the revolution will derive new strength by being universally understood. The scene that now opens itself to France extends far beyond the houndaries of her own dominions. Every nation is becoming her colleague, and every court is become her enemy. It is now the cause of all nations against the cause of all courts. The terror that despotism felt, clandestinely begot a confederation of despots; and their attack upon France was produced by their fears at home. 
GARROW 1744 “ In entering on this great scene, greater than apy nation has yet been called to act in, let us say to the agitated mind, be calm. Let us punish by instructing, rather than by revenge. Jet us begin the new era by a greatness of friendship, and hail the approach of union and success. Your fellow citizen, homas Parner. 
GARROW 1745 What are you by business 
GARROW 1747 Were you acquainted with Mr. Thomas Paine 
GARROW 1749 Have you at any time print any book for him
GARROW 1751 What wasit
GARROW 1753 Did you print one or two parts of that work 
GARROW 1755 Was it at the earlier part of the second part as you call it, or the latter part 
GARROW 1757 You did not finish it 
GARROW 1759 Look at these two books, and tell me whether you believe these to be copies printed by you 
GARROW 1761 How far did you proceed in printing the second part 
GARROW 1763 After the book was completed, did you ever converse with Mr. Paine about it
GARROW 1765 “ Can then Mr. Burke produce the English constitution? 1f he cannot, wo may fairly conclude, that though it has been so muc! talked about, no such thing as a constitution exists, or ever did exist, and consequently that the people have yet a constitution to form. 
GARROW 1766 (Page 59, Bvo. and page 25, 12mo. editions.)—“ A government on the principles on which constitutional governments arising out of society are established, cannot have the right of altering itself. If it had, it would be arbitrary. It might make itself what it pleased; and wherever such a right is set up, it shows there is no constitution. The act by which the English parliament empowered itself to sit seven years, shows there is no constitution in England. It might, by the same self-authority, have sat any greater number of years, or for life. he Bill which the present Mr. Pitt brought into parliament some years ago, to reform parliament, was on the same erroneous principle. The right of reform is in the nation in its original character, and the constitutional method would be by a general convention elected for the purse. There is, moreover, a paradox in the idea of vitiated bodies reforming themselves. 
GARROW 1767 (Page 63, 8vo. and 27, 12mo. editions.)— “ Much is to be learned from the French constitution. Conquest and tyranny transplanted themselves with William the Conqueror from Normandy into England, and the country is yet disfigured with the marks, May then the example of all France contribute to regenerate the freedom which a province of it dee stroyed !" 
GARROW 1768 (Page 161, 8vo. and page 74, 12mo. editions.}—“ The two modes of government which prevail in the world, are, first, government by election and representation : secondly, poreenmnent by hereditary succession. The former is generally known by the name of republic; the latter by that of monarchy and aristocracy. 
GARROW 1769 hose two distinct and opposite forms, erect themselves on the two distinct and posite bases of reason and ignorance
GARROW 1771 (Page 165, 8vo. and page 76, 12mo. editions.)—“ From the revolutions of America and France, and the symptoms that have appeared in other countries, it is evident that the opinion of the world is changed with respect to systems of government, and that revolutions are not within the compass of political calculations. The progress of time and circumstances, which men assign to the accomplishment of great changes, is too mechanical to measure the force of the mind, and the rapidity of reflection, by which revolutions are generated : all the old governments have received a shock from those that already appear, and which were once more improbable, and are a greater subject of wonder, than a general revolution in Europe would be now. 
GARROW 1772 “ When we survey the wretched condition of man under the monarchical and hereditary systems of government, dragged from his home by one power, or driven by another, and impoverished by taxes more than by enemies, it becomes evident that those systems are bad, and that a general revolution in the principle and construction of governments is necessary. 
GARROW 1773 “ What is government more than the management of the affairs of a nation? It is not, and from its nature cannot be, the property of any particular man or family, but of the whole community, at whose expense it is supported ; and though by force or contrivance it has been usurped into an inheritance, the usurpation cannot alter the right of things. Sovereignty, as a matter of right, appertains to the nation only, and not to any individual ; and a nation has at all times an inherent indefeasible right to abolish any form of governMent it finds inconvenient, and establish such as accords with its interest, disposition, and happiness. The romantic and barbarous distinction of mer into kings and subjects, though it may suit the condition of courtiers, cannot that of citizens ; and is exploded by the principle upon which governments are now founded. Every citizen is a member of the sovereignty, and, as such, can acknowledge no personal subjection ; and his obedience can be only to the laws. 
GARROW 1774 “ When men think of what government is, they must necessarily suppose it to possess a knowledge of all the objects and matters upon which its authority is to be exercised. In this view of government, the republican system, as established by America and France, operates to embrace the whole of a nation; and the knowledge necessary to the interest of all the parts, is to be found in the centre, which the parts by representation form: but the old governments are on a construction that excludes knowledge as well as happiness; government by monks, who know nothing of the world beyond the walls ofa convent, is as consistent as government by kings. 
GARROW 1775 “What were formerly called revolutions, were little more than a change of persons, or an alteration of local circumstances. They rose and fell like things of course, and had nothing in their existence or their fate that could influence beyond the spot that produced them. But what we now see in the world, from the revolutions of America and France, is a renovation of the natural order of things, a system of principles as universal as truth and the existence of man, and combinin, moral with political happiness and nation: prosperity. 
GARROW 1776 1, Men are born and always continue free, and equal in respect of their rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public utility. 
GARROW 1777 “ 2. The end of all political associations is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man ; and these rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance of oppression. 
GARROW 1778 “3. The nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty ; nor can any INDIVIDUAL, Or ANY BODY OF MEN, be entitled to any authority which is not expressly derived from it. , 
GARROW 1779 (Page 171, 8vo. and page 78, 12mo. editions. —“ As it is not difficult to perceive; from the enlightened state of mankind, that hereditary governments are verging to their decline, and that revolutions on the broad basis of national sovereignty, and government by representation, are making their way in Europe, it would be an act of wisdom to anti cipate their approach, and produce revolutions by reason and accommodation, rather than commit them to the issue of convulsions. 
GARROW 1780 “ From what we now sce, nothing of reform in the political world ought to be held improbable. It is an age of revolutions, in which every thing may be looked for. The intrigue of courts, by which the system of war is kept up, may provoke a contederation of nations to abolish it: and an European congress, to patronize the progress of free government, and promote the civilization of nations with each other, is an event nearer in probability, than once were the revolutions and alliance of France and America. 
GARROW 1781 [The following passages were read from the Second Part of the “ Rights of Man.} 
GARROW 1782 (Page 21, 8vo. edition.)—“ All hereditary vernment is, in its nature, tyranny
GARROW 1784 (Page 27, 8vo. edition.}—“ How irrational then isthe hereditarysystem, which establishes channels of power, in company with which wisdom refuses to flow
GARROW 1786 (Page 47, 8vo. edition
GARROW 1788 “ The convention went deeply into all the subjects; and having, after a variety of debate ain investigation, agreed among themselves upon the several parts of a federal constitution, the next question was, the manner of giving it authority and practice. For this purpose they did not, like a cabal of courtiers, send for a Dutch stadtholder, or a German elector ; but they referred the whole matter to the sense and interest of the country. 
GARROW 1789 “ They first directed, that the proposed constitution should be published. Secondly, that each state shoul, elect a convention, expressly for the purpose of taking it into consideration, and of ratifying or rejecting it ; and that as soon as the approbation and ratification of any nine states should be given, that those states should proceed to the election of their proportion of members to the new federal government, and that the operation of it should then begin, and the former federal government cease. 
GARROW 1790 (Page 52, 8vo. edition.“ The history of the Edwards and the Henries, and up to the commencement of the Stuarts, exhibits as many instances of tyranny as could be acted within the limits to which the nation had restricted it. The Stuarts endeavourcd to 
GARROW 1791 8 those limits, and their fate is well known. In all those instances, weseenothing of a constitution, but only of restrictions, or assumed power. 
GARROW 1792 “After this another William, descended from the same stock, and claiming from the same origin, gained possession ; and, of the two evils, James and William, the nation preferred what it thought the least; since, from circumstances, it must take one. The act, called the Bill of Rights, comes here into view, What is it but a bargain, which the parts of the government made with each other, to divide powers, profits, and privileges: you shall have 30 much, and I will have the rest; and, with respect to the nation, it suid, for your share, YOU shall have the right of petitioning. This being the case, the Bill of Rights is, more properly, a bill of wrongs, and of insult. As to whatis called the convention parliament, it was a thing that made itself, and then made the authority by which it acted. A few persons got together, and called themselves by that name. Several of them had never been elected, and none of them for the purpose. 
GARROW 1793 “From the time of William a species of vernment arose, issuing out of this coalition ill of Rights ; and more so, since the corruption introduced at the Hanover succession, by the agency of Walpole; that can be described by no other name than a despotic legislation. Though the parts may embarrass each other, the sinle has no bounds; and the only right it acknowledges, out of itself, is the right of petitioning. Where then is the constitution, either that gives, or that restrains power ? “Itis not because a part of the government is elective, that makes it less a despotism, if the persons so elected possess afterward, as a parliament, unlimited powers. Election, in this case, becomes separated from representation, and the candidates are candidates for despotism. 
GARROW 1794 “ I cannot believe that any nation, reasoning on its own rights, would have thought of calling those things a constitution, if the cry of constitution had not been sct up by the government. 
GARROW 1795 (Page 63, 8vo. edition—a note.)—“ With respect to the two houses of which the English parliament is composed, they appear to be effectually influenced into one; and, as a legislature, to have no temper of its own. The minister, whoever he at any time may be, touches it as with an opium wand, and it sleeps obedience. hs 
GARROW 1796 “ But if we look at the distinct abilities of the two houses, the difference will appear so great, as to shew the inconsistency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to use it. Wretched as the state of Tepresentation is in England, it is manhood compared with what is called the House of Lords ; and so little is this nick-named house regarded, that the people scarcely inquire, at any time, what it is doing. It appears also to be most under influence, and the furthest removed from the general interest of the nation. In the debate on engaging in the Russian and Turkish war, the majority in the House of Peers, in favour of it, was upwards of ninety; when in the other house, which is more than double its numbers, .the majority was sixty-three. 
GARROW 1797 (Page 65, 8vo. edition.) —“ But in whatever manner the separate parts of a constitution may be arranged, there is one general principle that distinguishes freedom from slavery, which is, that all hereditary government over a people is to them a species of fslavery, and representative government is freedom,’, 
GARROW 1798 (Page 107, 8vo. edition.)— Having thus glanced at some of the defects of the two houses of parliament, I proceed to what is called the crown, upon which I shall be very concise, 
GARROW 1799 “ It signifies a nominal office of a million sterling a year, the business of which consists in receiving the money
ATTORNEYGENERAL 1802 Read the dedication first, and then the preface. 
GARROW 1843 I had dismissed this book, but the reading of the preface has reminded me of some passages I had overlooked. 
GARROW 1844 (Page 161, 8vo. edition.)—“ The fraud bypocrisy, and imposition of governments are now beginning to be too well understood to promise them any long career. The farce of monarchy and aristocracy, in all countries is following that of chivalry, and Mr. Burke is dressing for the funeral. Let it then quietly to the tomb of all other follies and the mourners be comforted. 
GARROW 1845 he time is not very distant when England will laugh at itself for sending to Holland Hanover, Zell, or Brunswick for men, at the expense ofa million a year, who understood neither her laws, her language, nor her interest, and whose capacities would scarcely have fitted them for the office of a parish constable. If government could be trusted to such hands, it must be some easy and simple thing indeed, and materials fit for all the purposes may be found in every town and Sillege in England. 
GARROW 1846 (Page 161, 8vo. edition.)—“ Within the space of a few years we have seen two revolutions, those of Americg and France. In the former, the contest was long, and the conflict severe; in the latter, the nation acted with sucha consolidated impulse, that having no foreign enemy to contend with, the revolution was complete in power the moment it appeared. From both those instances it is evident, that the greatest forces that can be brought into the feld of revolutions, are reason and common interest. Where these can have the opportunity of acting, opposition dies with fear, or crumbles away by conviction. It is a great standing which they have now universally obtained ; and we may hereafter hope to see revolutions, or changes in governments produced with the same quiet operation by which any measure, determinable by reason and discussion, is accomplished. 
GARROW 1847 “When anation changes its opinion and habits of thinking, it is no longer to be a verned as before; but it would not only wrong, but bad policy, to attempt by force what ought to be accomplished by reason. Rebellion consists in forcibl opposing the general will of a nation whether by a party orbyagovernment. There ought, therefore, to be in every nation a method of occasionally ascertaining the state of public opinion with t to government. On this point the old government of France was superior to the present government of England, because, on exinary occasions, recourse could be had to what was then called the States-general. Bat in England “there are no such occasional bodies; and as to those who are now called representatives, a great part of them are mere machines of the court, placemen, and depen
GARROW 1848 (Page 170, 8vo. edition—a note.)—“ I know it is the opinion of many of the most enlightened characters in France, (there always will be those who see farther into events than others) not only among the’ general mass of citizens but of many of the principal members of the former National Assembly, that the monarchical plan will not continue many years in that country. They have found out, that as wisdom cannot be made hereditary, powet ought not; and that, for a man to merit a million sterling a year from a nation, he ought to have a mind capable of comprehending from an atom to a universe; which, ifhehad, he would be above receiving the pay. But they wished not to appear to lead the nation faster than its own reason and interest dictated. In all the conversations where Ihave been present upon this subject, the idea always was, that when such a time, from the general opinion of the nation, shall arrive, that the honourable and liberal method would be, to make a handsome present, in fee simple, to the person, whocver he may be, that shall then be in the monarchical office, and forhim to retire to the enjoyment of private lite, possessing his share of general rights and privileges, and to be no more accountable to the public for his time and his conduct than any other citizen. 
GARROW 1849 I shall now return to the Proceedings of the Constitutional Society ; read an entry at a meeting of the 5th of October, 1792.

GARROW 1854 “Gentlemen, I have just published a small treatise, in a letter to the National Convention of France, on the defects of the constitution of 1791, and the extent of the amendments which ought to be applied. As the true pouerce oF government are the same in all countries, being founded on the Rights of Man, which are universal and imprescriptible, I conceive the subject of this treatise cannot be foreign to the great object of your association, of which you have done me the favour to make me an honorary member; I, therefore, present a copy of it to you, with the same confidence that Ihave done te the National Convention, a confidence arising froma full conviction that the work is founded in truth and reason, although these principles seem not so immediately reducible to practice in the government of this country asin that of France, yet their examination can never be unseasonable. 
GARROW 1855 “ A great revolution in the management of the affairs of nations, is, doubtless, soon to be expected through all Europe; and, in the progress of mankind towards this attainment, it Is greatly to bedesired that the convictions to be squires from rational discussion, should precede and preclude those which must result from physical exertion.

GARROW 1865 I believe you are a bookseller in St. Paul's Church Yard 
GARROW 1867 And a publisher

GARROW 1871 Do you know the person who appears to be the author, Joel Barlow 
GARROW 1873 It appears to be published by you, does it not
GARROW 1875 I am not asking you at present whether these sheets of paper came out of your shop, have the goodness to attend to the question, you know Mr. Barlow you say 
GARROW 1877 Did you publish for him at any time a work with the title of that pamphlet

GARROW 1897 Did you sell many or few 
GARROW 1899 Did you sell some dozens 
EYRE 1901 It will not exse you to any hazard to say whether you appen to know how many copies were published. The witness ought not to, be asked how many he published himself. 
GARROW 1902 Do you know of your own knowledge whether the sale of the book called the Rights of Man was extensive or not? I do not ask you whether you sold one yourself. —Yes, I think I can say that the sale was large. Do you recollect receiving any number of a publication called a Letter to Mr. Dundas from Mr. Paine

GARROW 1911 [Extracts read from—“ A Letter to the National Convention of France, on the Defects of the Constitution of 1791, and the extent of the amendments which ought to be applied, by Joel Barlow, esq. author of Advice to Privileged Orders."} 
GARROW 1912 (From page 1, to the middle of page 12.)— “ gentlemen the time is at last arrived when the people of France, by resorting to their own proper dignity, feel themselves at liberty to exercise their unembarrassed reason, in establishing an equal government. The present crisis in your affairs, marked by the assembling of a National Convention, bears nearly the same relation to the last four years of your history, as your whole revolution bears to the great accumulated mass of modern improvement; compared, therefore, with all that is past, it is perhaps the most interesting portion of the most important period that Europe has hitherto seen. 
GARROW 1913 “Under this impression, and with the deepest sense of the magnitude of the subject which engages your attention, I take a liberty which no “i ht motives could warrant ina stranger, the liberty of offering a few observations on the business that lies before you. Could I suppose, however, that any apology were necessary for this intrusion, I should not rely upon the one here mentioned, but my intentions require no apology; I demand to be heard, as aright. Your cause is that of human nature at large ; you are the representatives of mankind; and though I am not literally one of your constituents, yet I must be bound by your decrees. My pines will be seriously affected by your deliberations; and in them I have an interest, which. nothing can destroy. I not only consider all mankind as forming but one great family, and therefore hound by a natural sympathy to regard each other's peptone as making part of their own; but I contemplate the French nation at this moment as standing in the place of the whole, you have stepped forward with a gigantic stride to an enterprise which involves the interests of every surrounding nation; and what you began as justice to yourselves, you are called upon ta finish as a duty to the human race. 
GARROW 1914  believe no man cherishes s greater veneration than I have uniformly done, for. 
GARROW 1915 the Nationaf Assembly who framed that constitution, which I now presume your constituents expect you to revise. Perhaps the merits of that body of men will never be properly apprectated. The greatest part of their exertions were necessarily spent on objects which cannot be deScribed; and which from their nature can meake no figure in history. The enormous weight of abuses they had to overturn, the quantity of pee with which their fune tions called them to contend, as well in their own minds as in those of all the European world, the open opposition of interests, the secret weapons of corruption, and the unbridied fury of despairing faction—these are subjects bik escape our common observation, when we contemplate the labours of that assembly. But the legacy they have left to their country in their deliberative capacity will remain a lasting monument to their praise; and though while searching out the defective parts of their work, without losing sight of the difficulties under which it was formed, we may find more occasion to admire its wisdom, than to murmur at its faults; yet this consideration ought not to deter us from the attempt. 
GARROW 1916 he great leading principle, on which their constitution was meant to be founded, is the equality of rights. This principle bein; laid down withsuch clearness, and asserted wit so much dignity in the beginning of the code, it is strange that men of clear understandings should fail to be charmed with the beauty of the system which nature must have taught them to build on that foundation. It shows a disposition to counteract the analogy of nature, to see them at one moment impressing this indelible principle on our minds and with the next breath declaring, that France shall remain a monarchy, that it shall have a king, hereditary, inviolable, clothed with all the executive, and much of the legislative ywer, commander in chief of all the national ree by land and sea, having the initiative of war, and the power of concluding peace, and above all, to hear them declare that, The nation will provide for the splendour of the throne,’ granting in their legislative capacity to that throne more than a million sterling a year, from the national purse, besides the rents of estates which are said to amount to half as much more. 
GARROW 1917 “ We must be astonished at the paradoxical Organization of the minds of men who could see no discordance in these ideas, they begin with the open simplicity of a rational republic, and immediately plunge into all the labyrinths of royalty; and 4 great part of the constitutional code is a practical attempt to reconcile these two discordant theories It is a perpetual conflict between principle and precedent, between the manly truths of nature, which we all must feel, and the learned subtilties of Statesmen, about which we have been taught fo reason. 
GARROW 1918 “ In reviewing the history of lumen opimions, it is an unpleasant consideration to remark how slow the mind has alwavs beem in seizing the most’ interesting truths; although, when discovered, they appear to have been the most obvious. where verified with more circumstances of regret, than in the progress of vour ideas im 
GARROW 1919 France relative to the inutility of the kinglyoffice. It was not enough that you too your first stand upon the high ground of natural right; where, enlightened hy the sus of reason, you might have seen the clouds of prejudice roll far beneath your feet, it was not enough: that you began by considering royalty, with its well known scourges as being the cause of all your evils, that the kings of modern Europe are the authors of war and misery, that their mutual intercourse is s commerce of human slaughter—that public debts and private oppressions, with ‘all the degrading vices that tarnish the face of nature, had their origin in that species of government which offers a premium for wickedness, and teaches the few to trample on the many; it was not enough that you saw the means ofa regeneration of mankind in the system of equal rights, and that in a wealthy and powerful nation you possessed the advantage of reducing that system to immediate practice asan example to the world, and a consolation to human nature. All these arguments, with a variety of others, which your republican orators placed in the strongest point oflight, were insufficient to raise the public mind to a proper view of the subject. 
GARROW 1920 “It seems that some of your own philosophers had previously taught, that royalty was Necessary to a great nation. Montesquieu, among his whimsieal maxims about laws and government, had informed the world thata i limited monarchy was the best possible system, 'and that a democracy could never flourish ; but in a small tract of country. How many of your legislators believed in this doctrine ; how many acted from temporising motives, wishing to banish royalty by slow degrees; and how many were led by principles less pardonable than either, it is impossible to determine. Certain it is, that republican ideas gained no ground upon the monarchical in your constituting assembly, during the last 8ix months of their deliberations. It is like-wise certain, that the majority of thatassembly took much pains to prevent the people from discovering the cheat of royalty, and to continue their ancient veneration, at least for awhile, in favour of certain principles in gos vernment, which reason could not approve, 
GARROW 1921 “It is remarkable, that all the perfidy of our king, at the time of his flight, should ave had so little effect in opening the eyes of so enlightened a people as the French, His flight, and the insulting declaration which he left behind him, were sufficient not onl: to give the lie to the fiction, with whic! common sense has always been put to the 
GARROW 1922 This renark isnoblush, and t6 which your assembly had ettempted to give a sanction, That Kingscan do no wrong; but they were sufficient to show, at least to all who would open their eyes, that the business of government required no such officer. There is no period, during your revolution, if there is any to be found in the history of France, when business went on with morg alacrity and good order, than during the suspension of the reyal functions, in the interval, from the time that the king was brought back to the capital, m June, tll the Completion of the constitution in September. Every: thing went right in the kingdom, except within the walls of the assembly. A majority of that body was determined to make an riment. of a limited monarchy. The e ment has been made. Its duration has, indeed, been short, being less than eleven months; but, although in some respects it has been almostas fatal to the cause of liberty as any system could have been within the time, yet in other respects, it has done more good t sophers of the age could have done in a much longer time: it has taught them a new doctrine, which no experience can shake, and which reason must confirm, That Kings can do no good. 
GARROW 1923 (oops 14 and part of 15)
GARROW 1925 (Page 22 to 26)
GARROW 1927 “ You will permit me to hint at some of the great outlines of what may be expected from you under the peculiar advantages with which, you meet to form a glorious republic. Ab though many of my ideas may be perfectly superfluous, Sane the same as will occur to every member of your body, yet it is possible that some of them may strike the mind in a new point of Jight, and lead to reflections which would not rise from any other quarter. Should this be the casein the sinallest degree, it ought to be considered, both by you and me, as an ample reward for our pains in writing and in reading this letter. 
GARROW 1928 “ On considering the subjectof government, when the mind is once set loose from the shackles of royalty, it finds itself in a new world: it rises toa more extensive view of every circumstance of the social state. Human nature assumes a new and more elevated shape, and displays many moral features, which, from having been always disguised, were not known to exist. In this case, it is a long time before we acquire a habit of traeing effects to their proper causes, and of applying the easy and simple remedy to those vices of our nature which society requires us to restrain. This, I apprehend, is the source of by far the greatest difficulties with which you have to contend. We are so much used, in government, to the most complicated systems, as being necessary to support those imPositions, erat oUt which it has been supposed impossible for men to be governed, that it is an unusual task to conceive of the simplicity to which the business of government may be reduced, and to which it must be reduced, if we would have it answer the purpose of promoting happiness. 
GARROW 1929 “ After presnling royalty, with all its appendages, I suppose it will not be thought necessary in France to support any other errors and superstitions of a similar complexion ; but that undisguised reason, in all things, will be preferred to the cloak of imposition. Should this be the case, you will conceive it no loner necessary to maintain a national church. 
GARROW 1930 "his establishment is so manifestly an imposition upon the judgment of mankind, that the sopiiuting assembly must have considered it in that light. It is one of those monarchical ideas, which pay -us the wretched compliment of supposing, that we are not capable of being perenne by our own reason. To suppose that the people of France are to learn the mode of worshipping ‘God from the decrees of the council of Trent, is certainly as absurd as it would ‘be to appeal to such a council, to learn how to breathe, or to open their eyes. Neither is it true, as is argued by the advocates of this part of your constitution, that the preference there given to one mode of worship, by the payment of the Catholic priests from the national purse, to the exclusion of others, was ‘founded on the idea of the property supposed to ‘have been possessed by that church, and which, by the assembly, was declared to be thenceforward the property of the nation. 
GARROW 1931 he church, in this sense of the word, signifies nothing but a mode of worship ; and to prove that a mode can he a proprietor of lands, requires a subtility of logic that I shall not attempt torefute. The fact is, the church, considered as an hierarchy, was always necessary to the support of royalty; and your assembly, with great consistency of design, wishing to preserve something of the old-fabric, preserved something of this necessar prop. But as the fabric is now overturned, the prop may be safely taken away. I am confident that monarchy and hierarchy will be buried in the same grave, and that in Trance they will not survive the present year. 
GARROW 1932 (Page-I,)—“ After laying down the great fundamental principle, thatak men are equal tn their rights, it ought to be the invariable object of the social compact to insure the exercise of that equality, by rendering them as ena in all sorts of enjoyments, as can possibly be consistent with good order, industry, and the reward of merit. Every individual ought to he rendered as independent of every other individual as possible; and, atthe same time, as dependent as possible on the whole community. 
GARROW 1933 “ On this siwieniable maxim, I think-the following positions ought to be founded and guaranteed in the constitutional code. 
GARROW 1941 Who was the author of this pamphlet, which appears to have been published by you, intituled “ Advice to the Privileged Orders ?"—I published a amphlet with that title tor Mr. Barlow: I believe this is it. 
GARROW 1942 Do you know whether he was the sole author of it, or were there any other persons: concerned in it
GARROW 1944 Which you published in the same way, I suppose, as you did the other—Had it a large sale 
GARROW 1946 Extracts read from “ Advice to the Privileged Orders of the several States of Europe, resulting from the Necessity and Propriety of aGeneral Revolution in the Principles of Government, Part I. the Third Edition, by Joel Barlow.} 
GARROW 1947 (From page 17 to page 20)
GARROW 1949 “ These are sober opinions, uniting a class of reasoners too numerous and too respectable to be treated with contempt. I believe, however, that their number is every day diminishing ; and I believe the example which France will soon be obliged to exhibit to the world on this subject, will induce every man to reject them who is not personally and exclusively interested in their support. 
GARROW 1950 “ The inconsistency of the Constituent Assembly, in retaining an hereditary king, armed with an enormous civil list, to wage war with aa popular government, has induced some persons to predict the downfall of their constitution ; but this measure had a different origin from what is commonly assigned to it, and: 
GARROW 1951 will probably have a different issue; it was the result rather of local and temporary circumstances, than of any general belief in the utility of kings, under any modifications or limitations that could be attached to the office. 
GARROW 1952 “ It is to be observed, first, that the French had a king upon their hands: this king had always been considered as a well-disposed man; so that, by a fatality somewhat singular, though not unexampled in regal history, he gained the love of the people almost in proportion to the mischief which he did them. 
GARROW 1953 condly, their king had very powerful family connexions in the sovereigns of Spain, Austria, Naples, and Sardinia, besides his relations within the kingdom, whom it was necessary to attach, if possible, to the interests of the community. Thirdly, the Revolution was considered by all Europe as a high and dangerous experiment; it was necessary to hide, as much as possible, the appearance of its Magnitude frum the eye of the distant observer, The reformers considered it as their duty to produce an internal regeneration of society, ratier than an external change in the appearance of the court; to set in order the counting-house and the kitchen, before arranging the drawing-room. This would leave the savereigns of Europe totally without a pretext for interfering, while it would be consoling to that class of philosophers who still believed in the compatibility of royalty and liberty. Fourthly, this decree that France should huve a king, and that he could do no wrong, was passed at an early period of their operations, when the above reasons were apparently more urgent than they were afterwards, or probably will ever be again. 
GARROW 1954 “From these considerations we may can clude that royalty ts preserved in France for reasons which are fugitive; that a majority of the Constituent Assembly did not believe in it as an abstract principle; that a majority of the people will learn to be disgusted with so unnatural and ponderous a deformity in their new edifice, and will soon hew it off. 
GARROW 1955 “ After this improvement shall bave been made, a few years experience in the face of Europe, and on so great a theatre as that of France, will probably leave but one opinion, in the minds of honest men, relative to the republican principle, or the great simplicity of nature, applied to the organization of society. 
GARROW 1956 (Page 21 )—“ It depends on a much more important class of meu, the class that cannot write, and in a great measure on those who cannot read ; it is to be decided by men who reason better without books, than we do with all the books in the world: taking it for granted, therefore, that a general revolution is at hand, whose progress is irresistible, my object is to contemplate its probable effects, and to comfort those who are afflicted at the prospect. 
GARROW 1957 Did you publish the former editions of this work

GARROW 2000 “ Frenchmen !|—While foreign robbers are ravaging your territories, under the specious retext of justice; cruelty and desolation leading on their van, perfidy with treache' bringing up their rear, yet mercy and friendship impudentiy held forth to the world as the sole motives of their incursions, the oppressed part of mankind forgetting, for awhile, their own sufferings, feel only for yours, and with an anxious eye watch the event, fere vently supplicating the Almighty Ruler of the Universe to be favourable to your cause, so intimately blended with their own. ’ “ Frowned upon by an oppressive system of control, whose gradual, but continued en croachments, have deprived this nation of nearly all its boasted liberty, and brought us almost to that abject state of slavery, frone which you have so emerged, 5,000 British citizens, indignant, manfully step forth to rescue their country from the opprobrium brought upon it, by the supine conduct of those in power. They conceive it to be the duty of Britons to countenance and assist, to the utmost of their power, the champions of human happiness, and to swear to a nation, proceeding on the plan you have adopted, aa inviolable friendship. ed from this day be that friendship between us ! And may vergeance to the uttermost, evertake the man who hereafter shall attempt to cause a rupture. “ Though we appear so few at present, be assured, Frenchmen, that our mumber increases daily ; it is true, that the stern uplifted arm of authority at present keeps back the timid, that busily circulated impostors hourly mislead the credulous, and that court intimacy, with avowed French traitors, has some effect on the unwary, and op the any bitions. But, with certainty, we can inform you, friends and freemen, that information makes a rapid progress among us. Curiosity has taken possession of the public mind; the conjoint reign of ignorance and despotism asses away. Men now ask each other, what is freedom? what are our rights? Frenchmen, you are already free, and Britons are preparing to become so ! “ Casting far from us the criminal prejudices artfully inaulcated by evil-minded men, and wily courtiers; we, mstead of natural enemies, at length discover in Frenchmen, our fellow citizens of the world, and our brethren by the same Heavenly Father, who created us for the purpose of loving and mutually assisting each other; but not to hate, and to be ever ready to cut each others throats, at the command of weak or ambitious kings, and corrupt ministers. 
GARROW 2001 “Seeking our real enemies, we find them in our bosoms; we feel ourselves inwardly torn by, and ever the victims of a restless, all-consuming aristocracy, hitherto the bane of every nation under the sun! Wisely have you acted in expelling it from France. 
GARROW 2002 “ Warm as are our wishes for your success, eager as we are to behold freedom triumphant, and man every where restored to the enjoyment of his just rights,.a sense of our duty, as orderly citizens, forbids our flying in arms to your assistance; our government has pledged the national faith to remain neutral: in a struggle of liberty against despotism, Britons remain neutral! O shame! But we have entrusted our king with discretionary powers; —we therefore must obey; our hands are bound, but our hearts are free, and they are awith you.

GARROW 2045 “ The Society for Constitutional Information in London, to the National Convention of France. 
GARROW 2046  Servants of a sovereign People, and Benefactors of Mankind, We rejoice that You, revolution has arrived at that point of perfection which will permit us to address you by this title; it is the only one that can accord with the character of true legislators. Every successive epoch in your affairs, has added something to the triumphs of liberty; and the glorious victory of the 10th of August, has fi prepared the way for a constitution, which we trust you will establish on the basis of reason and nature. 
GARROW 2047 ‘ Considering the mass of delusion accu mulated on mankind, to obscure their understandings, you cannot be astonished at the opposition you have met both from tyrants and from slaves. The instrument used against you by each of these classes is the same; for in the genealogy of human miseries, ignorance is at once the parent of oppression, and the child of submission. he events of every day are proving, that your cause is cherished by the people in all your continental vicinity; that a majority of each of those nations are your real friends, whose governments have tutored them into apparent foes, and that they only wait to be delivered by your arms from the dreaded necessity of fighting against them. 
GARROW 2048 “ The condition of Englishmen is less to be deplored—here the hand of oppression has not yet ventured completely to ravish the pen from us, nor openly to point the sword at you. From bosoms burning with ardour in your cause, we tender you our warmest wishes for the full extent of its progress and success. It is indeed a sacred cause ; we cherish it as the pledge of your happiness, our natural and nearest friends; and we rely upon it as the bond of fraternal union to the human race, in which union our own nation will surely be one of the first to concur. 
GARROW 2049 “ Our government has still the power, and perhaps the inclination, to employ hirelings to cuntradict us; but it is our real opinion, that we now speak the sentiments of a great majority of the English nation
GARROW 2051 “ Go on, legislators, in the work of human happiness— the benefits will in part be ours, but the glory shall be all your own It is the reward of your perseverance, it is the prize of virtue. The sparks of liberty preserved in England for ages like the coruscations of the noi aurora, served but to show the darkness visible in the rest of Europe. The lustre of the American republic, like an effulent morning, rose with increasing vigour, ut still too distant to enlighten our hemisphere, till the splendour of the French revolution burst forth upon the nations, in the full fetvour of a meridian sun, and displayed in ahe midst of the European world, the practical result of principles which philosophy had sought in the shade of speculation, and which experience inust every where confirm. It dispels the clouds of prejudice from all people, reveals the secrets of all despotism, and creates a new character in man. e 
GARROW 2052 “ In this career of improvement, your example will be soon followed; for nations rising from their lethargy, will reclaim the rights of man, with a voice which man cannot resist. (Signed by order of the Society) “ SemPitt, chairman, “D. Avams, secretary.

A translation of the papers herewith inclosed, was yesterday presented at the bar of the convention, and received with universal applause. After which, the president gave us the kiss of fraternity. in behalf of the French nation, which we returned in behalf of our society. The scene was truly interesting to ener feeling of humanity, and drew tears fro crowded assembly. It gave rise to reflexions, which can scarcely be conceived by men in any other circumstance of life; it was the reconciliation of brothers, who had long been excited to a mortal enmity by misunderstanding and mutual imposition, The .wounds which had bled for ages were closed and forgot, while the voice of nature declared they shoald never more be opened. The president pronounced a discourse in answer to our dress, which we likewise enclose.

GARROW 2077 “ Innumerable societies of a similar nature are now forming in every part of England, Scotland, and Ireland. They excite a spirit of universal inquiry into the complicated abuses of government, and the simple means of reform. 
GARROW 2078 “ After the example which France has fren, the science of revolutions will be renlered easy, and the progress of reason will be rapid. It would not be strange, if, in a period far short of what we should venture to predict, addresses of felicitation should cross the seas to a mational convention in England. 
GARROW 2079 “ We are also commissioned to inform the convention, that the society which we represent has sent to the soldiers of liberty a patriotic donation of one thousand pair of shoes, which are by this time arrived at Calais; and the society will continue sending a thousand paic a week for at least six weeks to come.

The sons of liberty through the world will never forget their obligations to the English nation. 
GARROW 2083 “ The shades of Pym, of Hampden, and of Sydney, are hovering over your heads ; and. the moment cannot be distant, when the people of France will offer their congratulations to a national convention in England. Too long has the torch of discord enflamed ad-the English and the French; while the ambition of kings, fomenting national aversions, compelled them -to forget, that nature has produced none but brothers. 
GARROW 2084 “ Your islands, it is said, were severed from the continent by a great convulsion of the globe; but liberty, established on the two shores of the narrow sea which divides us, will repair the breach, and restore the two nations to the harmony and friendship for which nature has designed them. Rea- son has begun her majestic march; she can no longer be resisted in her course.

GARROW 2108 “How glorious will it be for France and England to have formed alone a confede: destructive of tyrants, and to have purc! at the price of their blood, the liberty of Europe—we may say more, of the whole universe. 
GARROW 2109 “ Courage, brethren and friends. It is for you to follow us in the glorious and hazardous career of the revolution of the world. Can ye any longer groan under the yoke of a government, that has nothing of liberty but the name? For, although your land was inhabited before others by freemen, can ye, without illusion, consider your government as i “ Will ye content yourselves with a partial freedom ie Will the ‘Tagliah be satisfied with principles?

GARROW 2111 “ Your love for liberty has fixed your attention upon the wants of our defenders; your generosity toward them is a title to the acknowledgments of the republic.

GARROW 2122 Society of London. Yes, citizens, our brethren and friends, the 10th of August, 1792, shall be distinguished in the annals of the world as the day of the triumph of liberty. “ Our first revolution did but show to us the salutary principles of the imprescriptible i of man: except the unprincipled, and the enemies of humanity, adopted them with enthusiasm. It was then that we formed ourselves into a society, in order the better to impress them upon ourselves, and afterwards to teach them to our fellowcitizens. 
GARROW 2123 “Our first. constitution had consecrated them, but had not always taken them for its base. The dominion of the passions, the force of habit, the impression of prejudices, and the power of the intrigues employed in our Constituent Assembly, found the secret to preserve sufficient authority to our tyrants, to extinguish, at some time, the sacred rights of nature, and to re-establish despotism on its throne of iron. 
GARROW 2124 “ But royalty, thus preserved, was not content with the victory that had secured to it the greatest number of the corrupt persons who surrounded it. It was impatient to rea the fruits that it appeared to promise iteelk But its too great eagerness has hastened its ruin, and secured the triumph of reason. 
GARROW 2125 he French, proud of their new existence, soon perceived the fault of their first legislators, became sensible of the imperfection of its first laws—saw that they made a surrender of the rights of liberty and equality which they had embraced, they roused themselves anew to demand, at length, laws impartial and humane. 
GARROW 2126 “From thence the necessary day of the tenth of August 1792. From thence a second revolution, but a revolution which is only the completion of the first, which has received our vows and our oaths, and which we will bless for ever, if it leads us, as we hope it will, to the happiness of the nation, to the constant maintenance of liberty and equality. 
GARROW 2127 “ Let intriguers, tools, and tyrants calumniate us; we despise them too much to condescend to answer them, and seek for their esteem. 
GARROW 2128 hat which flatters us, is, the interest that you take in our labours, your attention to contribute to the success of our arms; we desire your esteem, we are proud of your approbation. 
GARROW 2129 “ We smile at the expression of the sentiments that you manifested to our representatives: we behold a nation of brethren rouse itself to support the cause of humanity: we behold the brave English adopt our principles, become our friends ; we say to ourselves with pleasure, soon will they become our allies, and, uniting our efforts, we shall go on to deliver the universe from the yoke of tyrants—to restore the nations to reason and nature.

GARROW 2322 “ Resolved, That a letter he written to Simon Butler and Oliver Bond, esqrs., expressive, of the high sense we entertain of their exertions in the cause of freedom, and to assure them, that we consider the imprisonment they at present suffer on that account, as illegal and unconstitutional. 
GARROW 2323 “ The following letter was produced and read. To S, Butler and a. Bond, esqrs. 
GARROW 2324 “ gentlemen, It is not easy for men, who feel strongly and sincerely, to convey those feelings by letter. We therefore rely an your Conceiving for us much of that which we are unable to express to you. We think, however, that we shall be guilty of a great omission, did we neglect the opportunity of sending you by Mr. Hamilton Rowan, t ihe honest tribute of our esteem and admiration, for your brave and manly resistance to the’ usurped jurisdiction of the Irish aristocracy. 
GARROW 2325 “ Permit us to offer you our thanks, and our grateful acknowledgment of your efforts, in what we consider as a common cause, while we lament our inability of proving ourselves useful in your defence. Although we are of different kingdoms, still we are but one peor ; and as the freedom of one continent as spread its influence to Europe, so on the other hand, we are persuaded, that the establishment of despotism in Ireland, must end in the slavery of Great Britain. But the light of liberty is not confined to one shore, or one latitude. 
GARROW 2326 “ We know that it is easier to admire than to practise those virtues that tend to the public benefit. 
GARROW 2327 “ Yet so long as the exertions of a few courageous men must influence the minds of at least the independent and thinking part of the community, we are assured that their labour is not fruitless. We trust, therefore, the time will soon arrive, when the abuse of power in either nation, will have no other consequence than the ruin of those who have committed that injustice. We hope, and we doubt not of soon seeing the day, when the post of honour shall be no longer that af obloquy and punishment; but when those who have risked their liberty and fortune in the cause of their countrymen, may find pro tection in the undisputed, uninterrupted exercise of trial by jury, with a full and adequate Tepresentation of the people in parliament,

GARROW 2344 No, I have not. I produce it merely as being found in the possession of Adams, the secretary to the Society for Constitutional Information. I will now put into court the letter actually sent, which was found in the possession of the secretary to the Norwich Society. It is dated, “ Society for Constitutional Information, London, 15th April, 1793, signed by order, in the name of the Society for Constitutional Information, D. Adams, secretary, and addressed “ Mr. J. Broughton, secretary to the United Political Societies, Norwich. 
GARROW 2345 “ Society for Constitutional Information. 
GARROW 2346 “ London, 15th April, 1793. 
GARROW 2347 “ Sir; We have to acknowledge with great satisfaction the letter which you favoured us with, dated the 5th instant, relative to the most desirable of all other objects, the reform of a parliamentary representation. The honour you do us in supposing that we are better fitted than yourselves for the promotion of political knowledge, we must disclaim; because we observe with the greatest pleasure, that our country correspondents have too much zeal and information to want success in their public endeavours, whether at Norwich, at Sheffield, at Manchester, or elsewhere throughout the nation. 
GARROW 2348 “ In our sincerity for the good of our country, we trust, that we are all equal, and as such we doubt not of our ultimate success. 
GARROW 2349 “ We see with sorrow the existence of those evils, which you so justly represent as the streams of corruption overflowing this once free and prosperous country. e see with surprise and abhorrence, that men are to be found both able and willing to support those corruptions. It is however no small consolation to find, that others are not wanting in every part of the nation of an opposite character, who are ready to remedy, ie all laudable and honourable means, the defect in our representation, the usurped extension of the duration cf parliaments, and other grievances such as you notice in your letter. 
GARROW 2350 “ That the constitution of England has no more of that character it once possessed, that the supposed democracy of the country has become a matter of property and privilege, and that we have therefore no longer that mixt government which our adversaries are praising, when they know it is no longer in our possession, are facts notorious and indisputable. Where then are we to look for the remedy? To that parliament of which we complain? To the executive power which is imlicitly obeyed, if not anticipated in that pariament? Or to ourselves, represented in some meeting of delegates for the especial purpose of reform, which we suppose you understand by the word CONVENTION ? 
GARROW 2351 “ It is the end of each of these propositions that we ought to look to; and as success in & good cause must be the effect of perseverance, and the rising reason of the time, let us deters mine with coolness, but let us persevere with decision. 
GARROW 2352 “ As toa Convention, we regard it as a plan the most desirable and most practicable, so soon as the great body of the people shall be courageous and virtuous enough to join us in the attempt. Hitherto we have no reason to believe that the moment is arrived for that purpose. As to any petition to the crown, we believe it hopeless in its consequences. With respect to the last of your proposals, we are ata loss to advise. If the event is looked to in the vote which may be obtained from that body to whom the petition is to be ad. dressed, which of us can look to it without the prospect of an absolute negative? In this. point of view therefore it cannot require moment’s consideration. But if we the policy of such a petition, it may, in our ape prehension, be well worth considering as a warning voice to our present legislators, and as a signal for imitation to the majority of the people. Should such a plan be vigorously and generally pursued, it would hold out a. certainty to our fellow-countrymen, that we are not a handful of individuals unworthy of attention or consideration, who desire the restoration of the ancient liberties of England ; but, on the contrary, it might bring into light that host of well-meaning men, who in the different towns and counties of this reatm are silently but seriously anxious for a reformation in the government.

We have seen and approved of your exertions for your country’s -happiness—We have marked with honest indignation, every step that your enemies have taken to bring you to your present situation.

GARROW 2578 o the Chairman of the Society for Constitutional Information. “ Surprise Transport, April 16, 1794. 
GARROW 2579 Fellow Citizens; I have long since looked upon your society with admiration and esteem, considering it as the source and school of most of the political information, which, by the blessing of God, has overspread the island. I have been instructed by the wisdom of your papers, and animated by the spirit of your addresses. That my conduct is epproved by such a society, is my pride and my joy. “ You say (es the consideration is the eupport of my life), that the history of liberty will prove by the experience of her former martyrs, that sufferings in her cause cannot be en vain, That my sufferings may not be in wain, I ardently wish that the eyes of my countrymen were open, not: only to the illegality and despotism of my sentence, but to the alarming measures ty which it was brought about. My jury was three times packed by the servants of the crown before tt vet upon me. In the first instance by the sheriff's deputy, placemen immediately apinted by the crown; in the second, by the erownagent, ford advocate, ec, at Edinburgh; 
GARROW 2580 and in the third, by the justiciary lords, who tried thecause. These last, arbitrarily appoint the fitteen particular persons who are to sit upon the accused. The strongest objections are mere air, as the lords alone are the judges of the validity of them. A majority of the fifteen condemns. If, therefore, ministry, with theig all-extensive influence, can in three countries find only eight servile tools subservient to their views, the fortune, the liberties, the lives of all Scotland are at their mercy. Trial is condemnation. ‘The sentence is appointed hefore-hend by the mipister, and mine was known a full week at Edinburgh before it was uttered. They can tuin, or even murder whom please. This infamous robbery of the first right of Englishmen, a trial by jury fairly chosen, I have endeavoured to set forth in a letter to the editor of the Morning Chronicle, last October or November, of the date (if I remember rightly) of the 22nd or 27th, of which I now avow myself the author, to which I beg leave to draw the attention of the Suciety for Constitutional Information. Farewell, tellowcitizens
GARROW 2582 “ Surprize Transport, Spithead, April 17, 1794 
GARROW 2583 “ Mr. President, Permit me, si, to assure you, and the respectable Constitutional Society, that the very consoling uddress, re ceived agreeably to their resolutiun of the 28th ult. has excited in me, as also in the hearts of each of my fellow martyrs, for the important cause of universal suffrage, end annual parliaments, the most lively sensations of gratitude and esteem. The Constituttopal Society was the foremost of true patriots to raise the Standard of Reform, for the purpose of redeeming from the contaminating and contagious influence of corruption, those venerable, but almost lost principles of the British constitution, Wrought into it by the blood and irresistible energies of our fore fathers, many of whom, rather than that these principles, upon which depend the virtue and felicity of Society should be lost sight of, exhibited their high esteem of them on scaffolds and in dungeons; that all, even the most callous spectators might be persuaded, that the truths for which they did not reckon even their lives too dear a sacrifice, were surely worthy of the unprejudiced inves tigation of all. Your remark therefore is just, and it is very soothing to us, “ We do not, we cannot suffer fur such cause in votn. The resentment of our enemies, driving them into such absurd measures towards men, against whom vice of any kind is not evea alleged, must have moved in every unprejudiced mind, the restless question; Why? Why are men who seek the improvement of their species thrown with felens into dungeons? And full information must follow sincere inquiry, and at length convert all to the side of truth and righteousness. I therdfore cheerfully consent to suffer to promote the general good. 
GARROW 2584 “We are blamed as baving yremabsecly, at least, exposed ourselves to the necessity of sealing by our sufferings, the cause we would promote. If in this case we have erred, I will readily take the whole blame, as having strained every nerve to press forward the measure of a general convention, as being the only means to avert impending ruin. I sought to erouse and alarm my countrymen to consider their extreme danger. I feared that the necessity for such association would be on ws before we were prepared for it. Besides, what measure could possibly interest so much the public inquiry? what has so much increased public information? It excited counter associations, and caused every man to see who were on the side of truth, and who were on the side of corruption: t exposed the selfish and interested designs of the one, and the unfeigned proseeution of the public good by the other.Ispeak so with the greater eonfidence before a Society that must have marked the progress of information eo long under their own auspices. You must know that this progress, the exciting the inquiry of the public, has been more extensively effected during the last year, then during the ten preceding ones. The eause was the General Convention. The terror and hatred of mimistry to it proves the truth. Whe then would have refused even his life to have been instrumental in promoting so much good ? 
GARROW 2585 “Your explicit approbation of our conduct has prompted this self-exultation; forgive therefore my freedom. I may be mistaken. The important revolution in human affairs, to which every Chrietian looks with anxious hope, may be yet distant. If it is, tyranny may still triumph. But God forbid it. It would then be better to die than to live. But though I hope the reverse, I know, as you justly observe, ‘ That the importance of the cause of freedom is too great to the world, “to expect its accomplishment without oppo“ sition,’ and the opposition of despairing tyranny will be dreadful, it will be destructive; and why

GARROW 2589 “ Worthy citizens, I will solace my mind, when drooping, with the kind assurance which you have vouchsafed by your masterly address, that I, with my brethren, have a place in your affection and prayers; aud I will believe with you, ‘ that the day is not very distant, when you will again receive us on British shores, the welcome children of a he and happy people.’ When indeed it shall demonstrated, ‘ hat our enemies are the “ enemies of public liberty ; the men who conspi“red against the happiness of mankind. But thoygh the gig are combined, though they should so far prevail as to scatter utterly in their vain apprehension the friends of truth, the Fine re of it which are already established, is the ‘ stone cut out without hands, and shall become a great mountain, ‘and fill the whole earth, for he who first commanded the light to shine out of darkness, is its almighty patron, 
GARROW 2590 “ Be assured, my dear brethren, that I have already realized the pleasures of conscious integrity, and can reflect with the sincerest satisfaction, that I was influenced in all my exertions for the cause of reform, by that benevolence which I would ever cultivate as ed principle of every kind of humaa excelnce.

GARROW 2593 “ Surprize Transport, April 24th, 1794. “ To the members of the Society for Constitutional Information, in London. “ That the spirit of Freedom is not extinuished, but still retains its former energy, in A fiance of the artifices and of the violence of despotism, is an object of high coi jon to my mind. Engaged in the sacred ceuse of man, individual man is an atom of little value; and in speaking of himself, when he recollects and contemplates the principles of his conduct, should disdain to make use of the term suffering. Wishout a vain affection, for myself, 1 disclaim the assumption of exdogrdiost merit. The man who has acted in obedience to the law of his own conscience, has simply discharged his duty ; and the contrary supposition would involve him in guj). I am deeply persuaded, that many of the men, whomnow address in a situation less cjrcumscribed, with abilities more powerful, but not with hearts more honest, after bering atchieved what I could sot accomplish, woul with the same cilent scorn have regarded each feeble attempt to shackle and to repress the freeborn mind.

ATTORNEYGENERAL 3234 In Sheffield 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3236 Is that the letter we have read that was sent to Hardy? Did you everseethat paper before 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3238 You have seen it before
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3240 How long had Davison lived at Sheffield? I cannot rightly tell; he came to live at Sheffield about the beginning of this year. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3241 Where did he come from 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3243 Was he in one of the societies at Leeds
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3245 Your lordship will find his name to the letter from Leeds thag has been read. Had you any conversation about the place to which the person to whom that letter was directed was to send his answer to Moody 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3247 Did he give a reason for that
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3249 Had you any talk how that happened, that a letter was to come to him directed to Moody
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3251 What is Moody 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3253 Had he any thing to do with pikes
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3255 What is Widdison
EYRE 3257 Whathad Moody to do with pikes 2—He put handles, I believe, to three dozen. 
EYRE 3258 What length were the handles 
EYRE 3260 What length were the blades 
EYRE 3262 What shape were the blades
EYRE 3264 you mean they were fluted like a bayonet 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3270 Were there any of any other shape 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3272 Were there any made that were not shafted, of any other shape 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3274 “ Was that one that was not of that shape ever shown to Yorke
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3276 You saw that one
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3278 Those that were actually shafted were in the shape of a bayonet 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3280 And the handle seven feet long, and the blade about ten inches 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3282 What wood were the handles made of
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3284 Was there any particular reason given why the handles were made of fir
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3286 You see there is a reason in the letter read just now 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3290 Has Davison been long at Sheffield 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3292 Do you know where he is now
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3294 Had he left Sheffeld at that time
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3296 How long before you were taken upi— Nearl about the same time, I believe. Did you ever hear of such a thing as a cat
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3298 What is that? what is the other nanre of it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3300 What is a night-cat 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3302 Have you seen one
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3304 When 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3306 Had you ever seen such a thing before? No, never. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3307 What is the use of a night-cat
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3309 Why, how was a night-cat to act against cavalry
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3311 You, a Sheffield man, must know how such a thing as that could hurta horse 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3313 ould it run into his neck, or what other part 
GARROW 3384 I must beg to object to that question; it is for the jury, what this may i suspected was behind the curtain, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3385 I certainty will not object to it.I desire to be understood, that I, by ao means, agree that it is a question that could he put, unless I consented to it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3415 Who told you that you had that right
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3440 You say this man told you he had seed some of these night-cats at Newcastle
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3442 Was it at any particular period of the history of the country, did he tell you
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3444 You say you expected opposition from the other party, at Sheftield
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3446 How came you and Davison to send a letter about sending pikes to London, in order to oppose the other party at Shetheld 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3448 So Davison sent a letter to London about pikes, you thinking they were to oppose the other party at Sheffield 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3450 You have talked about cavalry: what were the opposite party at Sheffield, who were to attack you with cavalry 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3452 How came you to talk about cavalry
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3454 Your opinion was about the opposite party at Sheffield, and Davison’s opinion, of course, about the opposite party in London 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3456 That is what he calls the bare-faced aristocracy of the present administration 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3458 What did you understand by that, when he showed you this letter, before he sent it to London, about the pikes, upon your oath 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3460 Why this Davison, who meant as little as you did, was not so bold as you, for he ran mney a fortnight before you were taken up
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3462 How came he to do that
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3464 You told us that the cheapness of the article was the reason why you thought of pikes
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3466 How much was the handle and the blade to cost 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3468 So that thirteen-pence would not pay for them
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3470 If the blade and the hoop had come to London, at the price of one shilling, there Would be some more expence to pay, that somebody else must provide for
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3472 ‘Did you ever hear of such a place as the Parrot, in Green Arbour Alley, London 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3474 Never 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3476 Had you any conversation with Davison about these pikes, after he showed you this letter
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3478 But after
GARROW 3480 You reside at Sheffield, I believe
GARROW 3482 What are you by business 
GARROW 3484 Were you a member of any society at Sheffield, which had the name of the Constie tutional Society 
GARROW 3486 At what time did you become a member of it
GARROW 3488 Were you one of twelve of that society which were afterwards associated with the Constitutional Society of London 
GARROW 3490 That is not the question that I put to you ; I ask, whether at any time you became an associated member of a society in London, called the Constitutional Society 
GARROW 3492 I did not ask you whether you were of not, but whether you were one of the twelve of the Sheffield Society who were associated with the Constitutional Society in London
GARROW 3494 I will explain the question to you: your society at Sheffield were more numerous than twelve
GARROW 3496 And when you were more numerous than twelve, the Constitutional Society in London were written to by your society—do you agree so far with me
GARROW 3498 Did your society, when you wrote to the other society, port any names of persons to be associated with the society in London
GARROW 3500 bia you know whether you, or any other persons of the Sheffield Society, were received as associated members of the Constitutional Society in London
GARROW 3502 Do I understand you right, that you do recollect such a prepeson moving from your society to the London Society 
GARROW 3504 Proposing such a measure
GARROW 3506 Did I understand you right, that one of the modes by which that acting in conjunction was to be brought about, was, that a certain number of your society should be associated with the London Constitutional Society, for the purposes of general conjunctive acting 
GARROW 3508 Did you at any time act as a secretary to the society at Shetlield
GARROW 3510 Was that the five months last before you were apprehended 
GARROW 3512 When were you apprehended 
GARROW 3514 Be so good as tell us for what purpose your Constitutional Society were assembled, and what the professed object of their assembling was 
GARROW 3516 By what means was that reform fo be effected 
GARROW 3518 people of the necessity of a reform, that they might unitedly move for it in the best and most unexceptionable mode. 
GARROW 3519 Was there any peculiar mode by which the election of meant to the House of Commons was to be effected, according to your proposition as to the right of voting
GARROW 3521 Are you acquainted with the expression— universal suffrage 
GARROW 3523 Was it or not the scheme of the Constitutional Society at Sheffield, that a reform was to be produced by universal sutfrage
GARROW 3525 Was the circumstance of the Edinburgh Convention known to the Constitutional Society at Sheffield —They sent a delegate, and therefore certainly they must know it. 
GARROW 3526 Who was their delegate at the convention at Edinburgh 
GARROW 3528 Do you know a person of the name of. Veucy Yorke
GARROW 3530 Perhaps you know him by another name
GARROW 3532 What is it
GARROW 3534 And who likewise goes by the name. of Yorke 
GARROW 3536 Did Yorke or Redhead ever reside at Shefficld 
GARROW 3538 Did he reside there for any time 
GARROW 3540 Do you know a person of the name of Gale, a printer at Shefficld
GARROW 3542 Mr. Yorke was not a settled inhabitant of Sheffield, was he 
GARROW 3544 Did he attend the meetings of the Constitutional Society at Sheffield
GARROW 3546 As he was not a settled inhabitant of Shef-field, in what character did Mr. Yorke, during his last visit, attend regularly the weekly Meetings of the society !—They, considering him as a man of considerable abilities, and as an orator, paid great respect to him, and he used to attend constantly onee a week at the meeting which was called the committce ; but jt was not properly acommittee, for the time of the expiration of the committee which was before, was clapsed, and another was not chose, and such persons who had been on the committee were admitted principally on ac count of Mr. Yorke being at Shefheld. 
GARROW 3547 You have given me a guod reason why he should be treated with respect when he was there; that he was a man of talents and an orator; but I ask in what character he came there 
GARROW 3549 You never heard from himself then in what character he came there 
GARROW 3551 But being there, you discovered be had great talents, and was an orator 
GARROW 3553 Did he take any part in the management of the business of the society 
GARROW 3555 Do you speak now of the weekly mectings, which were improperly called committees
GARROW 3557 Where were these mectings held 2—At my house. 
GARROW 3558 You had a commodious room there probably 
GARROW 3560 The meeting was improperly called a committee, when they met in a small room 
GARROW 3562 How often was the other room used
GARROW 3564 Was there in that room any preparation for the more commodious exercise of the talents of oratory of Mr. Yorke
GARROW 3566 What 
GARROW 3568 What was that called, that we may have 3 name to put down in our notes
GARROW 3570 What did you call it, for instance
GARROW 3572 What was the more general name for it ip the society 
GARROW 3574 And from this tribune Mr. Yorke addressed the society 
GARROW 3576 Besides those meetings, improperly called committees, and those meetings in which the tribune was, do you remember any meeting upon the Castle-hill
GARROW 3578 Was that of the date of the 7th of April 
GARROW 3580 Was Mr. Yorke there 
GARROW 3582 Did he there exercise himself in addressing the people 
GARROW 3584 In what sort of manner and Janguage 
GARROW 3586 Did that unfortunate fatality upon this occasion occur, that he did go farther than in your judgment he ought
GARROW 3588 First answer my question ; did it appear to you that his address that had Locke’s book for its text, was more violent, and went farther than it ought 
GARROW 3590 It was settled, you said, that you were todo something—settled by whom
GARROW 3592 At one of the committees 
GARROW 3594 For what purpose were you to make that motion as it was settled 
GARROW 3596 Was it settled at the committee before-hand then, that a motion should be made that it might be over-ruled 
GARROW 3598 id you make the motion as it had been agreed 
GARROW 3600 What was done upon your making that motion
GARROW 3602 Whom was it objected to by; who was the atiecior 
GARROW 3604 “You mean there were only four of the committee that attended
GARROW 3606 There was an elevation then upon the Castle-hill
GARROW 3608 Then one of these persons opposed your motion 
GARROW 3610 What number of persons might there be assembled at this meeting 
GARROW 3612 A meeting in the open air 
GARROW 3614 And then one of these persons opposed your motion, as it had been agreed, for the introduction of another 
GARROW 3616 What was the substance of that other motion
GARROW 3618 Drawn up by whom 
GARROW 3620 Was it before or after the meeting in the open air, that it was drawn up
GARROW 3622 Then it was left at your house for signa.’ tures 
GARROW 3624 Upon the occasion of the introducing this amendment upon your proposition, did Mr. Yorke address the meeting, composed, as you say, of some thousands 
GARROW 3626 Do you remember a day or two after the ineeting upon the Castle-hill, being in company with Gale and Yorke at your house,’ when any application was made to Yorke upon the subject of the speech he had delivered to the people upon the Castle-hill; do you re-' member any application to him a day or two afterwards, upon the subject of printing his’ speech
GARROW 3628 Did he agrce to print his speech
GARROW 3630 Was it printed 
GARROW 3632 Did you see it afterwards in print 
GARROW 3634 From having heard it upon the Castle-hill, could you form an opinion, whether the printed copy which you saw afterwards, was a pretty accurate statement of what passed 
GARROW 3636 Was that publistied at Sheffield
GARROW 3638 Do you believe this to be one of those publicationsIshowing it to the witness]
GARROW 3640 Did you receive afterwards from Yorke, any number of these pamphlets for any purpose
GARROW 3642 Did you do any thing with them by the direction of Yorke 
GARROW 3644 Do you mean the general meeting, or the private meeting 
GARROW 3646 Did you, in consequence, make up any packets of them, and do you believe these to be two of the packets [showing them to the witness]
GARROW 3648 How many might you direct in that manner in separate packages
GARROW 3650 What was done with these, after you had made them up separately, and addressed them to the different persons 
GARROW 3652 to whom were they sent!—To the best of my recollection they were sent to Thomas dy. 
GARROW 3653 What was your situation in life before you were applied to to become the secretary of this society 
GARROW 3655 Were you working at your business
GARROW 3657 Were you applied to to become the secretary, or did you apply for it
GARROW 3659 By whom 
GARROW 3661 What was your inducement to take that office upon you
GARROW 3663 What induced you to do it?7—The war destroyed my business. 
GARROW 3664 Am J to understand that you did it to increase your means of support ‘—I did. 
GARROW 3665 Did it come to your knowledge, in your character as a member of the society, or atherwise, that there were any preparations of arms of any sort at Sheffield 
GARROW 3667 Did you in the society, or from the members of the society, bear of any proposition for: 
GARROW 3668 providing arms, or that any were 1n preparation 
GARROW 3670 Eapisis that
GARROW 3672 T should be happy to see that advertisement, with what was said at this meeting, which ioe published in the Sheffield paper the week after. 
GARROW 3673 Was this hand-bill distributed previous to the meeting upon the Castle-hill
GARROW 3675 Was the subject of procuring arms publicly discussed or in the private meetings of the society 
GARROW 3677 A meeting in your large room 
GARROW 3679 A public meeting of the society 
GARROW 3681 By the society only
GARROW 3683 How did they come? were they introduced by memhers
GARROW 3685 Then members introduced visitors 
GARROW 3687 Did you see any arms, or any model of any 
GARROW 3689 Whatsort of arms were they that were talked of, as fit to be had for the pugposes stated
GARROW 3691 I do not know whether you heard any thing of the night-cats 
GARROW 3693 Now we will have an account of the manner in which children play at Sheffield, what sort of an instrument was it
GARROW 3697 Ithad four cross points? 
GARROW 3698 Juryman.—Were there only four of these
GARROW 3700 So that if you threw it down it always presented a point
GARROW 3702 How long is that point
GARROW 3704 Only made just to show what the sort of thing was
GARROW 3706 Was there any other purpose for which these instruments were spoken of in the so ciety to be made, except playing with them as children 
GARROW 3708 Where did you see the model 
GARROW 3710 Was he a member of the society 
GARROW 3712 Who produced it at his house 
GARROW 3714 Had you ever seen such a thing before
GARROW 3716 You neturally were led to ask its use and the purpose for which it was to be constructed, What was stated to be the purpose of this play thing
GARROW 3718 Was that act of throwing it on the floor, and of course its presenting one of its points a companied by no description of the use it might be applied to, besides playing with it
GARROW 3720 When talking of a play thing one is not serious; now, serious or not, what was said of it 
GARROW 3722 What was said, serious or not serious, as to the use to which that might or could or was intended to be applied
GARROW 3724 Was it called by any name
GARROW 3726 A night Cat, or day Cat, or any thing of that kind 
GARROW 3728 Was there any conversation at that time when it was thrown upon the floor about Cavalry 
GARROW 3730 You said just now that the conversation, such as it was, might not be serious
GARROW 3732 Where was it that there was conversation about the town of Newcastle 
GARROW 3734 Upon your oath were you never present when that model was produced, and when there was a conversation about Newcastle 
GARROW 3736 Then you never heard any conversation at Sheffield about this night-cat or this model of a night-cat with respect to cavalry 
GARROW 3738 Now that trifling, pleasing, desultory, irregular conversation I want to have—I am sure I cannot reccllect it; if I could recollect it I would. 
GARROW 3739 ‘Try, do not hurry yourself —I cannot recollect any thing that was said, only his taking it out of his pocket, showing it us, and throwing it on the floor; there was no regular conversation, no debate whatever about it. 
GARROW 3740 And the nature of the desultory observations that were made you do not recollect 
GARROW 3742 Et was a thing that you had never seen any thing like before 
GARROW 3744 You contented yourself with seeing it thrown down, and looking at one of its points
GARROW 3746 You tokl me that at the meetings at the Castle-hill, Mr. Yorke, though in general warm and energetic, and disposed to say strong things, did not say any hing that was detrimental to the cunstitutional law of England, were you present at any other meeting where his speeches were not quite of that character 
GARROW 3748 Perhaps those might be meetings of the society only 
GARROW 3750 But with visitors admitted, be so good as tell us the tendency of his discourses when he rather gave himself liberty, when he followed the impulse of his nature? —If I had noted them down, I might have been able to have repeated them. 
GARROW 3751 I do not expect you should give us them in his manner or precise words, but give us the substance and effect of those expressions which appeared to you to be unguarded 
GARROW 3753 Endeavour to recollect —I may have heard him when conversing in those meetings, sometimes he was very warm to be sure, and might drop unguarded expressions. 
GARROW 3754 Such as what unguarded expressions 
GARROW 3756 Jjoved, he might step out of the way. 
GARROW 3757 What expressions did he use which appeared to you to be unguarded 
GARROW 3759 Who were we 
GARROW 3761 How many were the people present with whom Mr. Yorke was to come up rather than to submit to the degraded state in which the people of England were
GARROW 3763 Was this at one of the meetings of the s0ciety 
GARROW 3765 One of the general meetings 
GARROW 3767 Composed of members of the society and of others
GARROW 3771  Was that after you had heard any thing upon the subject of arming
GARROW 3773 Was that delivered from the tribune? Delivered from the place which was sometimes called so, and sometimes called a pulpit. 
GARROW 3774 It was from the orator’s elevation that this speech was delivered 
GARROW 3776 Perhaps having brought that to your memory may enable you to recollect some other accompanying expressions 
GARROW 3778 What was it that occasioned any sensation of pain in you at that declaration of Mr. Yorke
GARROW 3780 And therefore you felt pain at that declaration of Mr. Yorke
GARROW 3782 Now, either at that or any other of these meetings, do you recollect any of these expressions of Mr. Yorke—I do not recollect any expressions that so struck me as that. Ido not know whether you have seen this paper before? [showing the witncss a printed paper]—I never saw this, but I saw one from which this was taken. 
GARROW 3783 Have you seen a pamphlet of which you believe that to be one copy 2—Yes. 
GARROW 3784 Look at this [showing the witness another pines pamphlet,“ the fast-day as observed at heffield ] have you seen that before 
GARROW 3786 Do you remember the circumstance of a proclamation for a general fast to be held the 8th February, 1794 
GARROW 3788 In what manner was that fast observed upon the Castle-hill at Sheffield 
GARROW 3790 Where was it
GARROW 3792 In the open air 
GARROW 3794 Were you there
GARROW 3796 What number of persons do you think might be assembled for the purpose of observing that fast
EYRE 3798  How is that evidence. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 3799 Your lordship will recollect that we read a resolution from the books of the Constitutional Society, thanking the people of Sheffield for the manner in which they had spent the fast-day. 
GARROW 3800 With this addition, that the printed paper in my hand was found in the prisoner’s possession. 
GARROW 3833  Look at these pamphlets (the fast-day as observed at Sheffield, and a serious lecture), where did you find them
GARROW 3835  After the serious lecture was read, there was ahymn prepared I believe 
GARROW 3837 Who prepared that hymn 
GARROW 3839 Who composed it
GARROW 3841 That was sung in full chorus by the whole assembly 
GARROW 3843 By whose order were these two pamphlets printed and published 
GARROW 3845 By whose order, and at whose expense i— They were sold. 
GARROW 3846 But there is an expense incurred, in print ing and publishing before the sale reimburses
GARROW 3848 Who ordered it to be printed 
GARROW 3850 Who. furnished the copy to Gale
GARROW 3852 Who read the lecture
GARROW 3854 Do you know of any proceedings of the society, of the committee, or of Yorke, respectig pang and publishing these two pamphlets 
GARROW 3856 Were they in general distributed through the town of Sheffield 
GARROW 3858 Do you know of your own knowledge whether the sale was extensive or not
GARROW 3860 There is a prayer, who composed that, do you know 
GARROW 3862 Whom was that delivered by? —By myself. 
GARROW 3863 From notes, or extempore 
GARROW 3865 You had written it, and committed it to memory, perhaps 
GARROW 3867 What became of the copy 
GARROW 3869 By whose directions
GARROW 3871 A private meeting of what 
GARROW 3873 Tell me, if you know their names, John Paine, of Newhill
GARROW 3875 Was hea member of the society 
GARROW 3877 It is in evidence, that he was one of those sent up by their secretary to the London society. 
GARROW 3878 You know Joseph Gale 
GARROW 3880 He was a member
GARROW 3882 And Joseph Smith 
GARROW 3884 And David Martin 
GARROW 3886 It is not worth while going through the names; they were sent up to the Constitutional Society, to be affiliated with them, which is proof that they were members. 
GARROW 3887 Extracts read from a printed pamphlet, intituled, “ Proceedings of the Public Mecting, held at Sheffield, in the open air, on the 7th of April, 1794 ; and also an “ Address to the British Nation, being an Exposition of the Motives which have determined the Pcople of Sheffield to petition the House of Commons no more on the Subject of Parliamentary Reform. Printed for the Sheffield Constitutional Society. 
GARROW 3888 “ Proceedings of the Public Meeting. 
GARROW 3889 “ In pursuance of a public advertisement, a alge meeting of the Friends of Justice, Lierty, and Humanity, was held, at three o'clock on Monday, the 7th of April, 1794, on the Castle-hill, in Sheffield, to consider upon the propriety of addressing the king, in behalf of the persecuted patriots, citizeas Muir, Palof again petitioning the House of Commons for a reform in the representation of the people, and to determine upon the propriety of peutioning the king, for the total and unquaified abolition of negro slavery. 
GARROW 3890 “ Notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather (very severe rains having fallen until within a quarter of an hour of the appointed time of mecting), from ten‘to twelve thousand people were assembled on the occasion: 
GARROW 3891 “HENRY YORKE having been voted to the Chair, he business was ‘opened by reading the following Address to the king, in behalf of the suffering patriots : 
GARROW 3892 “ TO THE KING. 
GARROW 3893 “ An Address from the Inhabitants of the Town and Neighbourhood of Sheffield, in the County of York. 
GARROW 3894 “ Sirnzr; We, the undersigned, being warm friends of liberty and the rights of man, feel ourselves deeply affected by the sentences which have lately been passed in your majesty’s courts of Scotland, upon citizens Muir, Palmer, Skirving, Margarot, and Gerrald. 
GARROW 3895 ‘Had these ‘men been really guilty of crimes, their punisliment should doubtless have been proportionate to their offences ; but, so far from considering it as a crime for a man to use every constitutional means in his power to effect a reform in the Commons House of Parliament, we think that every man who thus exerts himself, deserves well of his country; since we are persuaded that nothing short of the accomplishment of such a reform will restore peace and happiness to our present aggrieved and injured nation. 
GARROW 3896 “ We trusted also, that your majesty entertained the same opinion with us of such exalted conduct, from your majesty’s having chosen for your most confidential servants in the state, men who had singularly distinguished themselves by their patriotic exertions in the cause of parliamentary reform : 
GARROW 3897 “ But the friends of these sufterers having brought their case before parliament, without producing the desired effect—the principal of these very servants of your majesty having opposed the measure with all his corrupt, but irresistible influence—seeing no other resource, we approach your majesty in this address, to intreat your majesty to interfere in behalf of these (whom we deem) innocent men, with that power which the British constitution has placed in your majesty, of pardoning whom your majesty pleases—a privilege which is sometimes graciously extended even to real and palpable criminals. 
GARROW 3898 “Let it not be recorded in the history of this country, that king George 3rd, or any of his judges, transported men for fourteen years, because they had dared to speak the same words upon a speculative subject, which, if they were not the immediate means of adwancing his majesty’s then prime minister toobedience to it could result solely from mohis high situation, caused his election to be ; tives of fear. That liberty of opinien could remarkably popular: let it not be said, thatnot be denied to any free country, without men of education, of refined sentiments, ofdenying at the same time the rights of the the most virtuous and benevolent characters, peuple. That nothing argued more strongly were severed from their dearest connexions, ; against a government than the uniform pe and plunged into dungeuns with thieves andsign of depriving the people of this liberty ; prostitutes: letit not be said, that fathers worethat it was a proof that something went torn from their wives and children, and sonswrong ; and that even governors were from their aged parents, because they had the ashamed of their conduct, when the right of virtue openly to condemn the acknowledgeddiscussion was violated, or put an end to. corruptions of government, and to exert every The civil liberty we enjoyed in our eountry peaceable means in their power to remove was the effect of political discussion ; amd its them: let it not be said, that it was as great political liberty would have long since been a crime to speak the rruta, as to be guilty restored and secured, if our rulers had not of FELONY. 
GARROW 3899 “ But rather, O king, let it be recorded, : that George 3rd had the wisdom, the huma-' 
GARROW 3900 nity, and the justice, to step in betwixt these severe and cruel sentences and their execution. 
GARROW 3901 hese are our desires—these our plain sentiments. We know they are such as your majesty is unaccustomed to hear; but, if they are supported by truth and reason, suffer not the homeliness of our manner to offend your majesty. We are plain men, and will not flatter a king. If our wishes be attended to, we are persuaded it will, in some good degree, hush the murmurs which unreasonable severity in a government never fails to excite; and it may also avert that storm, which it is but too evident has long been awfully gathering, and which may burst forth in a moment when your majesty thinks not. 
GARROW 3902 “ The address being read, and received with repeated applauses, Hrnry Yorkr addressed the meeting in support of the measure. He observed, that the cause for which our countrymen were now suffering, was the same as had been advocated in the year 1783, by Mr. Pitt, the duke of Richmond, and other men, who were at this time pensioners and placemen under the actual government; that a convention, for the purpose of obtaining a 
GARROW 3903 Pasaeinen tary reform, had been held at the hatched House Tavern, in which these men went as delegates, or acted as assistants ; that ’ 
GARROW 3904 it was cruel, if not unjust, to punish men for following the example which those in power had set them. ‘The question was not a question of convenience, but of right
GARROW 3906 rst, iving a power of decisiun to j stich the ancieat lars of the land did aed knowledge: secondly, by confounding the truth with the fact of publication: and, ‘thirdly, by having punished with the utmost severity libels in private cases, to prepare the public mind for those severe sentences in public ones, -which dishonoured and irritated the nation. It had been lately the fashion to confound government with the constitution, and the ministry with the government. Tooppose, therefore, the mad and wild, if not criminal schemes of administration, was to Oppose government, and, by this mode of reasoning, to oppose government was to be an enemy to the constitution. A govemment can never give a more authentic proof of its propension to tyranny, and of the impropriety, as well as impolicy of its measures, ‘than by restraining or Prbidding the liberty of discussing publicly matters of legisiation and policy. It is debasing the character of man, as an intellectual being, to deny him the right of inquiring into that which even governors allow was made for his use, namely, government. 
GARROW 3907 “Yo punish inquiry, severity is exercised for imaginary guilt. But what is the effect? Mischiet is prolific: violence in government begets resentment in the people, who murmur and exclaim: government is provoked, and studies vengeance. When one act of vengeance is exposed, more always follow. Af-fection is lost on both sides, and, what is worse, is irrecoverable. Hatred begins; and the government and the people being at variance, consider each other no longer as magistrate and subject, but as mutual enemies. Hience the inhuman wish of Caligula, that he could murder all the people at one blow. The sequel is in order: he is continually destroying them; they are continually wishing him destroyed. Such conduct had the fa tendency of cramping the genius of men, andof replunging the nation into a state of bar-barism with regard to their religion, ther Jaws, their morals, and their government, andto keep them ignorant of the most important concerns in their trade, their splendour, theirfelicity ; whilst all the nations around themeee improving themeclves in morals and policy, by the dering efforts and concurrence of enlightened men, whose views were directed to those objects alone which were really worth their attention. The reasoning of a vernment, which prohibits information, is fective in every parti 3 its progress is not to be stopped, nor even to be checked, without mannii disadvantage. Prohibition has no other effect than to irritate men; to inspire them with an idea of insurrection, and to giveto all their writings a libellous tendency, Severe and arbitrary sentences may intimidate, but they cannot conzince a nation. It is by reason and argument alone, opposed to apparent reason end apparent argument, that a mment can hope to be victorious over ite-internal enemies, or render itself permanent by the quiet and conscientious concurrence of all its citizens. It is doing too much honeur to innocent subjects to be alarmed at a few pages of writing, or at a few fugitive orations, when barracks are erected in a country, and 60,000 armed nvercenaries are ready to execute the mandates of government. Experience had proved, that the rigorous prosecutions which had lately taken place throughout England, and that the cruel sentences which had disgraced the capital of Scotland, had not answered the purpose of establishing arbitrary power, and of crushing the rebellion of honest minds. Although there is no spirit so erect and independent as not to be broken hy the long continuance ofthe silent and inglorious sufferings of a gaol; yet it had been found, that men were proud to step forward in this most stormy season, when. such terrible examples of legal vengeance had been held up hefore them, to plead the ancient rights oe their country, to unmask the infamy, intrigue, and murderous projects of administration, and, according to : the principles of the purest benevolence, toassert the liberty of the whole human race.‘The present times bore a strong and marked ! resemblance to those terrific ages when priestsheld their dominion over the minds and consciences of men, and when they endeavouredto establish the reign of intolerance and orthodoxy amidst flakes of fire, and streams of human blood. All history had evinced, that every attempt to curb and bridle the expansion of the human mind had been inettectual; it had evinced, that opinions, though smothered for a time, burst forth with redoubled fury, and were victorious over power; it had evinced the triumph of reason and truth over prejudice and superstition, and that liberty, whether of opinion or person, however slow in its progress, had uniformly moved forward towards its destined goal; and that even, at this moment, the interruptions which had been opposed to it in our own country, although they might be imjurious to individuals, would finally obtain, confirm, and establish the rights of the people. Conscious of their uprightness, the friends of freedom had persevered in their noble cause, unappalled by the influence of spies and informers, and by the threats of a corrupt, a crazy, and wicked administration. 
GARROW 3908 In so doing, they had acted in perfect conformity to the principles of virtue, without which no man could be a friend to his country, anda lover of mankind. Its essence consisted in the regulation of oue conduct by such moral axioms as are best calculated to promote the general happiness of our fellowcreatures; and as it frequently happened, that the happiness of the tndividual stood in direct opposition to that of the public, it is the perfection of virtue in individuals to sacrifice their own happiness to that of the public. A man, in possession of this virtuous principle, feels delight whilst actually buming in the brazen bull of Phalaris; and such, he trusted, was the actuating principle of those generous patriots, who are become willing victims of the most barbarous and savage sentences that ever had been pronounced in 
GARROW 3909 Britain; who had made a glorious stand aguinst arbitrary power, and who broke loose trom the fondest endearments of human life, in the hope of redeeming their lost country from the fangs of a dark and brooding prejudice, and fron the horrors and turpitude of an igneminious slavery. 
GARROW 3910 t was the tyranny of the British government which drove William Pena, with the Pelscophie people called Quakers, to the deectable regions of Pennsyivania, where, by toleration, industry, and permanent credit, they revived the simplicity of the primitive ages of society. It was the same tyranny which has driven into voluntaay exile, or forced by law into banishment, the most virtuous of men, the first of philosophers, the most exalted and courageous band of patriots that ever honoured the soil of Britain. Among the former Joseph Priestley, one of the most profound philosophers of the age, and most meek au amiuble of citizens, claims the sad pre-eminence ; and among the latter, stand the names of those persecuted patriots, in whose behalf we are pow about to address the exccutive magistrate of our country—a noble and a generous band, whose sufferings do not claim our pity, because they boil up our rage; whose sentences disgraced those who pronounced them, not those on whom they were pronounced; whose condition is enviable, because honourable, and to the whole of whose opinions and conduct, no good man, or honest citizen, can give one dissentient voice! In times like these, when a man is mocked and insulted, because he bears the name of a patriot, an epithet once honoured by the people of England; at a time when those who have the courage and magnanimity not to flatter their country, are deserted, betrayed, and persecuted, what honours are sufficient for oe ve thunder truth against tyranny? What disgrace ought not to aout ose. ted beings, those re tize patriots, who keep aloof from the scene of action, and riot on their country’s wrongs? When our nation shall be regenerated, thesepersecuted nen will wear civic crowns. In the political, as in the moral world, the friend who appears to soothe our distresses, excites our esteem; and he who, in calamitous times that try men’s souls, sacrifices interest, friends, and home, iv order to save his sinking country, merits well, not only of every Briton, but of all maukind, and even of the government under which he lives. 
GARROW 3911 “ Fellow Citizens, the day is at length arrived, when fanaticism and superstition, deprived of their tinsel trappings, and exposed, in their native ugliness, to the view of mankind, slink scowling back to the cave of obscurity; there I hope they will for ever remain. The energy of Englishmen will no longer endure this strange uproar of injustice. I trust my countrymen are sick of religious and political imposture ; and that their decisive and manly conduct will command, in an imperious tone which will take no denial, not a melioration of these enormous abuses, which would be to compromise with injustice; but I trust they will demand the annihilation of corruptions and abuses, and a restitution of the original rights of human nature. I ask of our governors, this pe question, is itbetter that the people should be in a constant state of stupidity, than that they should be sometimes turbulent
GARROW 3913  need not invite you, fellow citizens, to feel for any human being who suffers, much less need I solicit your approof of the present measure, after the general testimony of satisfaction you have given of it. You are too enlightened to need the aid of any instruction from me, and your understandings are too much amakened to require that your passions should be played upon. Whilst the unerring tribunal of posterity shall condemn with scorn and derision, with execration and disgust, those inbuman beings who have been the causes of such unexampled and inhuman severity, our persecuted brethren will obtain a verdict of honour and glory. I may venture to say, that beloved by the present age, future ae shall heap around their monuments trophies of undying fame; and an exasperated and repentant people, shall enroll their names in the volume of history, which records also the names of Sidney, Hampden and Locke! 
GARROW 3914 “ The following Resolutions were then read three times over, and with the exception of one or two persons, were unanimously adopted : 
GARROW 3915 “1, That the people, being the true and only souree of government, the Seetoca of speaking and writing upon any subject, can not be denied to the ineribers 8 a vernment, without offering the grassest insult to the majesty of the people. 
GARROW 3916 “g, That therefore the condemnation of citizens Muir, Palmer, Skirving, Margarot, and Gerrald, to transportation, for exposing the corruptions of the British government, was an act better suited to the maxims of a despotic than a free government. 
GARROW 3917 “ 3, That the address which has now beer read, be presented to the king, in behalf of the above persecuted patriots. 
GARROW 3918 “ On the second resolution being proposed, an hiss'was heard from different parts of the meeting, in consequence of one or two persons holding up their hats against it; on obe serving which, H. Yorke thus ad the meeting: 
GARROW 3919 “ Fellow Citizens; As your chairman I call you to order. As an individual, I must observe, that this hissing is repugnant to the principle of toleration or freedom, which we wish to see established. We have this moment read, and given our assent to, an address to the king in favour of liberty of opinion ; let it not be said, that we are the first to violate thatliberty in others, which we claim for ourselves. Opinions will always vary, even amongst the wisest and bestot men. Weare bound, therefore, to show tenderness to the opinions of others, and compassion even to their prejudices. Let our enemies see that we consecrate by our example, what we desire to see established as a principle. Hisses do not convince; they tend only to irritate the minds, and to beget the ill-will of our fellow citizens: let us, on the contrary, confront them with the weapons of reason and truth, the onl logic of liberal minds. Every thing whic! has a tendency to stir up the passions without awakening the understanding is unbecoming of freemen, or of men who would be free. 
GARROW 3920 “ These well-timed observations had the good effect of preventing any further signs of Intolerance; and the utmost decorum pre
GARROW 3921 ‘vailed throughout the conduct of the business, 
GARROW 3922 “ It was next moved, ‘ that a petition be presented to the House of Commons, for a reform in the representation of the people in parliament ;’ but so marked was the disaps probation pre by the whole meeting to this Measure, that not one single person seconded the motion; but a most profound silence, interrupted only by a few murmurs, was observed: upon which, Henry Yorke again rose, and addressed the meeting in an animated speech of an hour long, and of which it is impossible for us to give our readers a just conception. He took a general view of the British constitution, and stated its most prominent defects; among which the want of a perfect natienal representation was the most laring. He dwelt a considerable time upon is subject, and then proceeded to take a rapid survey of the exertions which had been made at different periods, and by different persons, to promote the cause of parliamentary teform. 
GARROW 3923 “ He observed that the subject was become a mere bugbear, employed to deceive the peole, and worked upon as an engine to raise into power, needy and ambitious men: that the very same men who in opposition had declared that it was the only measure of saving the country from ruin, were the first to reprobate and scout the measure of reform when they were in power, From the corruptions of the British government, parties had been generated, which in their route to power, had convulsed and plundered the empire. Under the distinctions of names, principles had been forgotten; and for the sake of leaders, whom the people had foolishly idolized, the machine of government rolled on amidst the feuds and contentions of party. Eternally the peace of our country had been distarbell by the rancour and animosities of factions, and the people, instead of turning themselves to correct the gross evils which existed in it, had ever been the tools of base and designing men, and seemed prepared to whet and sharpen their swords one against another. 
GARROW 3924 “It was now high time that the people should lay asideleaders, discard, factionsand act 
GARROW 3925 Sor themselves. He strongly inforced these principles, and then pa into a complete detail of the ancient constitution as established by Alfred, which he proved to be at this time totally defaced, if not lost. He then pursued the gradual decline of popular liberty in EngJand, from the anarchy which was the consequence of Danish and Norman invasion; and taking a general sketch of our history, so far as it was connected with the subject of popular representation, he made some strong and pointed remarks on the Revolution in 1688, the object of which, he said, was not, could not be answered, unless annual parliaments and ee sufirage were restored. For this he the authority of lord Sommers, who drew up the declaration of rights, and who was promoted by William 3rd for his popular exertions at that memorable epoch. 
GARROW 3926 “ In order to prove that the Revolution had not corresponded with the expectations of the people, no sooner was the prince of Orange established on the throne of England, than all ideas of the ancient mode of annual parliaments were effaced, and the TRIENNIAL ACT was passed in the very face of that revolution, and in direct contradiction to its principles; for the revolution, at least so far as it respected the people, was not intended to be a compromise between the king and the aristocracy, for the joint inheritance of the people, but to establish on unequivocal principles the right of the people to govern themselves, and to recall those delegated powers which they had entrusted to their servants for this purpose, when they were either abused, or neglecte to exercise them. If the revolution were not a revolution for the people, it was no revolution at all, but a conspiracy of a few ennobled oppressors against the liberties and happiness ofthe many. Butif it were designed to comprehend the people, and its end has been perverted, or purposely laid aside, the people are not warranted in petitioning, but are justified in demanding as a Right, agreeably to the tone of language used in the declaration of rights, the restitution of annual parliaments, and the establishment of universal suffrage. But the shock which was given to the stability of these principles, was most infamously flagrant, by the enacting of the sEPTENNIAL act, in the reign of George 1st. If the act of parliament in the reign of Henry 6th, erased from the roll of citizenship some of the best members of the community; the enacting of the triennial and septennial acts, filled up to the brim the measure of governmental iniquity, and poured forth the waters of bitterness throughout our land. 
GARROW 3927 “Frtrow Citizens; Enough of precedent. The human race has long been rolling down the tide of ages neglected, unpitied, an oppressed. It is Tigh time that the devious course of human policy should not be left to the uncertain issue of storms and of elemental wars; but that the machine of state should be guided by the polar star of reason alone, which is never seen but when the majesty of the people is resplendent. What is beneficial in the example of ages, we ought to reserve with caution. What is injurious, and what is only tolerably competent to answer the common purposes of society, ought to be abolished. We insult ourselves, when we abjectly distrust the powers which nature has given us; nor ought we passively to acquiesce in institutions whic, though injurious, may be preferable to those that may be endured by others. We insult ourselves, when we foolishly balance between tolerable vices and positive good ; between unnatural systems, and Novel, untried, but just maxims. ‘The human mind is progressive, so is the social mind. That the one therefore should remain stationary, amid the rapid course of the other towards perfection, is a prejudice as unnatural as it is injurious to the happiness of man. The governments of Europe present no delectable symmetry to the contemplation of the philosopher, no enjoyment to the satisfaction of the citizen. A vast, deformed and cheerless structure, the frightful abortion of haste and usurpation, presents to the eye of the beholder no systematic arrangement, no harmonious organization of society. Chance, haste, faction, tyranny, massacre, and the hot, inclement action of human passions, have begotten them. Utility never has been the end of their institution, but partial interest has been its fruit. Such abominable and absurd forms, such jarring and dissonant principles, which chance has scattered over the earth, cry aloud for something more natural, more pure, and more calculated to promote the happiness of mankind. Experience must regulate the mechanism of government, by which I mcan not a narrow and confined, but a liberal and enlightened experience, which, hearing without passion or prejudice, the testimony of ages and nations, collects from it general principles, to further the progress of civilization. It is in history that we are to dive for those rich materials of legislative experiment, which are to ameliorate the social order, and repair those breaches which injustice has long since made. But if this experience be found inadequate to the purpose of alleviating human miseries ; if it afford nothing but the melancholy prospect of outradespotism; of excessive vices on the pert of the governing, and debasement and vassallage on that of the ed; if it ascribe the commeotions of sufiering countries to the designs of factions, asd not to principles; if it show, that in consequence of national ignorance, after the first ebullitions of revolt, they have sat down in a torpid calm, and borne with usurpations stili heavier than those by which they were roused te arms—it must be ted that this experience is important; use it teaches the suffering nations of the present day, in what manner to prepare their combustible ingredients, and humanists in what mamner to enkindle them, so as to produce, with effect, that grand political explosion, which, at the same time that it buries despotiam, already convulsive and agonising, in rains, may raise up the people to the dignity and sublime grandeur of freedom. 
GARROW 3928 e effect this just and useful purpose, reselution. of sentineng must precede revolution of government and manners. The popular energies must be excited, thas the popular voice may befeltandheard. The people must grow wise, im order that the people may rule. It is said we preach anarchy, but what is anarchy but: the establishment. of confusion on the wreck of popular opinion? It is said we are levelless; bus those are levcllers who would. wish to seduce man to the condition of the brute, guided by passion, and wninfuenced. by reason. Those are levellers whose hands are dipped in the public spoils; who assert inxpusity fer crimes, and inviolahility of persona ; who would make humanity take a retrograde motion; who would paisy the arm of justice, and defeat the endof equal laws. bape have ever disclaimed the foolish idea of levelling property ; because our own pyu i the fruit of our laboar, or of our fet en wae by the examale, be exposed to the invasion of the first mtrudes. It were well, if those who confound justice with crimes, would consider that the poor man's property, little as it is, is as precious to him, as is the wealthy stock of the rich man. It were well, if fecling the force of this principle, the aristocracy would unite with us in the cguse in which we are embarked. Property, they say, iseaered—Is not then the property of the poor man as sacred as that of the rich; and ought it to be filched or forced from him without his consent, any move than that ef the rich man? Can these ; who do not respect the property of otbers, expect others to respect their property? We wish to exail, not te level. We wish to better the condition of the wretched; to equalize men under the influence of law; but te give to merit, industry, talents, patrimony, virtee, their proper weight and correspendent dignity in the social order. Are we then ungoivernable, because we rcjeet mis-government? Are we ungrateful, because we defend cur liberty and property against those who ought to respect them? Are we rebels in manmtaining our violated laws against those whe ase open rebels to laws, and who set themselves above those laws which they ought to have venerated? I know, that in all ages of the world, people who would not be oppressed have been reckoned ungovernable by mea who are, or who would be oppressurs. I know that the enemies of oppression have always becn stigmatized as enemies of goverament. I knew that it is seditious to blame the excesses of power, and insolent to mentioa the insolence of those who abuse power. I know that it is sedition to distinguish between public right and public wrong, between government and tyranny. Nor is it enough to acknowledge all good government to be irresistible ; but the worst, and the abuse of the dest, must be irresistible also. I know that to complaia of tyranny is faction, and to ; throw it off rebedlion; but they who oppress are the greatest Rebeds, and for the oppressed to tusn upon them, is but to resist Rebellion— it is but to do a just and nateral action. Whoever violates the laws of reason, equity, and nature, whatever station or name he may bear, is a Rebel, subject to laws against tyrants and rebellion. ‘Tyrants, theretore, and oppressors, are the highest and most consummate rebels in the world—capital traitors to God and Man, and punishable by all the laws of God and Man. Amid all the absordities and chimeras of paganism, it was never believed that tyranny was warranted by heaven. It was never believed that the bloody Caligula was the vicegerent of God, and that the worst of men had a commission from heaven to oppress the human race. It was never believed that murder, rapine, and misrule, were government; and that lawless and bloody crowned robbers, were governors divinely appointed. It was never believed that society had no remedy against devouring lust the raging sword, which were destroying all the ends of society, and even society itself Such indignitics 
GARROW 3929 God and man were never broached by pagans;attempt be made to wrest what remains of they never propagated doctrines which would have turned men into idcots, destitute of reflection and fecling; into beasts of burthen and beasts of sacrifice; turned heaven into hell; human society into a chaos of blood and carcases; and the earth into a place of torments. It never entered into the heart of a Greek or a Roman, nor into any heart that felt the sentiments of virtue and humanity, that it was unlawful to defend nature; a crime to ward off murder, barbarity, and desolation; and an impiety to do the most godlike action which can be done on this side heaven, that of disarming tyrants, and of saving our country from perishing. Government is doubtless a sacred thing, and justly claims our reverence and duty; Sut when government is general oppression; when havoc, spoil, and persecution prevail, to the destruction of all who do well; when law and justice are banished, and military despotism triumphs; when property is attacked and seized without the consent of its owner, and lives are wantonly destroyed ! —is this government too? If it be, tell me what is not government? I do not think, in an age like this, that the people of this, or any country, can ever be so sunk or deadened by oppression, but that repeated provocation will raise a spirit amongst them capable of accomplishing the greatest projects. Even the most professed and degraded slaves, the people of Turkey, often rouse themselves, and casting thcir proud rider to the earth, trample him to death. A little spark often kindles a great flame, and a flame soon spreads to a conilagration. An ignorant mation roused to assert its liberties, will be mad and furious; for when men are used like beasts, they will act like beasts! But when an enlightened people, knowIng their rights, are reduced to a state of degradation, they will know thattheir condition cannot be worse, but, by their own efforts, their condition must be Better. An ignorant people, incited by repeated injury to shake off the load of injustice, will risk unseen evils and calamities—will risk even a civil war to be revenged on their oppressors. Such was the temper of the Romans upon the revolt of Sacrovir—they even exulted in it, and in hatred to Tiberius, wished success to the public enemy. — Such were the injured people of Spain, who, when the Romans came, joyfully received them as their deliverers from the tyrannous yoke of Carthage. But an enlightened people will never sully the victories of patriotism by such irregular conduct Revenge will never be adopted as aa principle nour, and they will glory in awaiting the slow process of universal information, as a prelude to universal emancipation, rather than tarnish the career of liberty, by involving their country in scenes of terror, waste and depredation. Oppressed nature will, at a proper season, depart from passive principle ; and should an liberty from us, I trust all men will concur to vindicate their violated rights—tor, if the lived be suffered once, it will be often repeated. A few repetitions create a habit, and habit will claim prescription and right. For governors to be omnipotent, the race of man must be extinct; and no argument for destroying anarchy can be used, but what is full as strong for the overthrow of tyranny. It is difficult to restore public affairs, when once disconcerted, to their former steady principle—numbers will engage in the cors tuption, and will try every art and power to support it, and they will continue to do so, until nature, which is always uppermost in Man, signs their tragical doom ! 
GARROW 3930 “ Citizens, I repeat my former assertion. Go on as you hitherto have done, in the cul

Teach them to do unto all men as they would that they should do unto them, and thcir love shall ; not be confined to their country, but shall ex tend to the whole human race. When sucha revolution of sentiment shall have dispersed the mists of prejudice ; when by the incessant thunderings from the press, the meanest cot-tager of our country shall be enlightened, and the sun of reason shall shine in its fullest meridian over us; then the commanding voice of the whole people shall recommend the five hundred and fifty-eight gentlemen in St. Stephen’s Chapel, to go about their business.

GARROW 3934 “4, Thatin every country where the people have no share in their government, taxation is ae 
GARROW 3935 “ 5, That therefore a government is tyrannical or free, in proportion as the people are equally, or unequally, represented. 
GARROW 3936 “6. Convinced of this truth, it is the opinion of this meeting, that the people ought to demand as a right, and not petition as afavour, for universal representation, 
GARROW 3937 “7, That therefore we will petition the TJouse of Commons no more on this subject. 
GARROW 3938 “ An Address to the British Nation. “Friends and Countrymen; We have heard this day decided, with the exception of only one dissentient voice, that the House of 
GARROW 3939 Commons shall never again be petitioned by us, on the subject of parliamentary reform. 
GARROW 3940 “ We owe to the nation, to posterity, even to foreign countries, and to the government 
GARROW 3941 Itself under which we live, an exposition of our motives. To the nation we owe this duty, because we are of opinion, that THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE, SHOULD BE, AT ALL TIMES, THE SUPREME LAW; and that if the few dissent from the opinion of the many, however obligatory the will of the majority may be to them as arule of action, yet opinion is always free and sacred, the right of man to enjoy, and the conscientious duty of man to diffuse. Under the full conviction of this principle, we feel ourselves, at present, the mimority, because we are the first to agitate the question, and to repel the monstrous idea of Pentontng when our petitions are not received by the House of Commons. But, we are numerous—we are many thousands; and as nothing opens the eyes of men so much as their interests, we demand, fellow-citizens, way, we are entitled to it from our numbers, that you lend an attentive ear to the truths we are about to utter, and tothe reclamations we are about to make in favour of oppressed humanity. 
GARROW 3942 “ Our petition was received with the utmost indignation by the House of Commons ; which was no more than we expected. We knew that the homely truths we uttered, would be very unwelcome guests in that house. We never expected that a body in which there were so many placemen and pensioners, would listen to the palpable facts stated in that petition; the object of which was to root out injustice, and to curb licentiousness and corruption. Nevertheless, as we were called upon by our countrymen to unite with them, we ;thonght ourselves bound to comply with their wishes, And, although our petition was disdainfully rejected, because not couched in language sufficiently polite and respectful for the five hundred and fifty-eight gentlemen who sit at the House of Commons, yet, believe us, FELLOW-CITIZENS, we are still of opinion, that the matter it contained, was not only just and Proper, but we think, that even the language, which gave so much offence to the honourable &entlemen, was much too polite and too moderate for us. For, if the House of Commons were the real representatives of the people, we certainly had a right to dictate, and not to petition, because they could be considered in no other light than as the organs of the public will. And, if they refused to obey that will, they would be usurpers, and not representatives. If, on the contrary, they are not the representatives of the people, what have we to do with them? If they are not our representatives, we cannot be their constituents ; and to petition those who are not our representatives as our representatives, would be a manifest absurdity, if not’ an insult and mockery of ourselves, However, the petition, such as it was, being termed disrespectful, was thrown out bya majority of 79, there being 29 only who voted for its being received, and 108 who voted against it, Such imperious treatment rather gives warning than strikes terror. The abuse of representation can never come in the place of a rule, for no legal power can be derived from injury or injustice. On this ground alone, therefore, we are justified in preserving a sullen silence m respect to the House of Commons. For, if grievances, abuses, complaints, and truth, are to be discarded from that House, because not dressed in a gentleman-like language, how are we, plain mechanics, ever to obtain redress, who are not gentlemen, and who are, consequently, ignorant of those polite and courtly expressions which are necessary to gain a hearing in that House. We are ignorant of the art of displaying truth by halves, and, as we love plain dealing ourselves, we detest hypocrisy in others, and pity those who would wish us to follow their cxample. We said to the House of Commons, we are wronged and aggrieved—will you right us, and redress our grievances, or will you not? If you will, we shall be satisfied; if you will not, we shall seek redress some other way. This is the sole question with us, and we put it, as we thought, in a most becoming style to the House of Commons. But, our petition bei scouted, we shall trouble them no more wit! our coarse and unmannerly language. It will be our duty to proceed, as we have uniformly done hitherto, in enlightening the public mind; and, when a complete revolution of sentiment shall take place (as will shortly be the case) in our country, we shall open our mouths, in that key we think most agreeable to ourselves; and our voice, together with that of our disfranchised countrymen, will resemble, perhaps, the thunderings from Mount Sinai! 
GARROW 3943 “ Yes, countrymen, we demand equality of rights, in which is included equality of representation, without which terror is law, and the obligations of justice are weakened ; because, unsanctioned by the sacred voice of 
GARROW 3944 }the people. We are not speaking of that visionary equality of property, the practical assertion oF biel weld vetolate the world, and replunge it into the darkest and wildest barbarism ; but that equality we claim, is to make the slave a man, the man a citizen, and the citizen an imtegral part of the state; to make him a joint sovereign, and not a subject; to oblige law, which ought to be an emanation from the general will, to shed its influence, without distinction, over the heads of all, and to restrain or strike the wealthy poses equally with the more homely otender. We onto give rights to him who has none, and a country to San who wants one. We wish to upset the idol of injustice, which has poured forth, from its exalted throne, a deluge of sorrow, and flooded the world with the tears and the blood of its inhabitants. We desire to see wisdom demanding of miserable millions their wants, humanity at hand to supply them. We de sire to see the sanctuary of virtue erected, and the standard of liberty planted in our land, around which the people may rally as to an holy of holies. In short, we desire to see the altar of equality blazing in Britain, whose streams of fire, whilst they shall shock, convulse, and tear down the rotten pillars of prejudices; whilst they shall consume tyrants, and terrify public delinquents, shall pierce into the hearts of the whole people, and confirm the wide empire of morals on the wreck of superstition and vice. Such is our equality, and such is the equality which we proudly gratulate our countrymen, will shortly be established in Britain, and which we invite pou PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND, to partake of
GARROW 4003 I could wish to ascertain whether I have taken you correctly; you meant, and as far as you understand, your society meant to produce a reform of the representation of the people in the Commons House of parliament y peaceable means 
GARROW 4005 but you apprehended, that when you should depute your delegates to a convention, that you trusted to that convention, and that what might then be done you could not answer for, not being able to answer for the wickedness of individuals—Did I take you correctly 
GARROW 4007 For the purpose of obtaining this desirable object of a parliamentary reform, you say you corresponded not only with the Constitutional Society, but with other societies ; and among them, you have named a society called, a society of the. Friends of the People 
GARROW 4009 Do you know the answer which that society returned to your’s as early as the 26th of May 
GARROW 4011 Perhaps I may assist your memory, by reminding you of the reply of your secretary to that society 
GARROW 4013 Da you know a person of the name of Ashton
GARROW 4015 You have said that your object, and, as far as you know, theobject of your society, was, to obtain a reform by peaceable means, and by enlightening the public—I ask you, if you do not know, that upon the society of the Friends of the People returning some answer to your society, that your society wrote, by means of Ashton, your secretary, disclaiming any farther communication with the society of the Friends of the People, as unfit for your purpose 
GARROW 4017 Was the measure ofdiscarding this society of the Friends of the People, as unfit for your purposes, discussed in your committees 
GARROW 4019 Was it discussed in any mecting of the divisions 
GARROW 4021 Wasit in any meetings 
GARROW 4023 That answer won’t suit me—I ask, whether in any meetings of your society, the propriety of having nothing farther to do with this society, the Friends of the People, because they would not go the lengths that made them fit for your communication, was ever discussed
GARROW 4025 Was the result of that discussion commun cated to your associated society, the Constitutional Society, that this society, the Friends ofthe People, whatever they professed to do, were not'fit persons for your having any thing more to do with them 
GARROW 4027 Idonot ask you, whether you know that such a letter was received, or whether you know that such a letter was sent; but I ask you, if the result of your deliberation was not, that they were unfit for your society, thatthe Constitutional Society might be so informed 
GARROW 4029 Do yourecollect whether Mr. Yorke took any part in that discussion 
GARROW 4031 Who were the parties 
GARROW 4033 Have you read the declarations published by that society, called the Friends of the People : doubtless you have, for your information; or if you have not read them yourself, have they been read in your society 
GARROW 4035 Do you not know that in language, to which to be sure I can do no justice, they declared their firm intention, by all constitutional and proper means, to produce that very thing which you state to have been your object, a reform in the representation of the Commons House of parliament 
GARROW 4037 However, they had made those professions 
GARROW 4039 But that you did not quite believe. Was this, think you, as early asthe 26th of May, 1792, that you disclaimed these Friends of the People 
GARROW 4041 And that was long before Mr. Yorke came among you upon his last mission 
GARROW 4043 But the object was calling upon the people of Sheffield to arm against foreign invaders and domestic enemies
GARROW 4045 Tet us see that we quite understand one another, Did you adopt that hand-bill, and arm in consequence of it, or were you alarmed atits being prodigiously unconstitutional, and arm against it 
GARROW 4047 But the society 
GARROW 4049 Was thatto arm against the invasion of foreign enemies, or protect yourselves against attack from domestic enemies
GARROW 4051 Your society, after this hand-bill, calling upon people to arm against foreign invaders and domestic enemies, took that hand-bill as their text, commenting upon it, adopting their resolution, and arming themselves
GARROW 4053 Your reason for doing this was, that you were afraid of illegal force being used against you, as had been done at Manchester and at Birmingham. Did you apply to any magistrate for protection 
GARROW 4055 Give me the facts first, and the comment afterwards. Did you apply to any magistrate informing him, that you, who were peaceable persons, had been threatened with attacks, and wanted the protection of the civil power
GARROW 4057 Tam not capable of arguing with you; I say that unaffectedly. Did you apply to any magistrate, informing him, that any peaceable persons had been threatened with attacks, and wanted the protection of the civil power
GARROW 4059 But, on the contrary, you published resolutions for arming 
GARROW 4061 You had no intention at all of altering the overnment, but of applying to the House of Ee crus to redress the grievances, under which the people suffered 
GARROW 4063 How early was it that you came to resolutions in your society to petition the House of Commons no more; for that these 558 persons were too fine gentlemen for you; and you were not used to the cuurtly language that would suit their ears 
GARROW 4065 And you, who were too rough for the House of Commons, were courtly enough to i? these resolutions which were proposed y Yorke and Gale, two of the active meimbers of the society, You say the society winked at them 
GARROW 4067 However, pass them you did
GARROW 4069 The next step was to form a convention, and by the delegates to procure a full, fair, and equal representation by means of the convention 
GARROW 4071 About the slave-trade 
GARROW 4073 Whether this was a part of these resolutions which passed upon the subject of arming seo That the landing of Hessian troops in this country, a ferocious and unprincipled horde of butchers, without consent of parlia

GARROW 4080 Be so good as to tell me, as you were toarm at Sheffield, very properly as I agree with you, for the sake of preventing attacks upon you, whether you communicated to any other parts of the kingdom the sort of instruments with which you meant to arm yourselves, and your plan of arming
GARROW 4082 Do you mean to say, that you do not now know that your society communicated plans for arming, the mode of procuring the instruments, and the models of the weapons 
GARROW 4084 Then if Davison, in the name of the society, sent any such letter to London, you were not in that secret 
GARROW 4086 You know Davison very well
GARROW 4088 He was a member of the society 
GARROW 4090 You have told me, there was no man at Shefficld mad enough to think of altering the percronient by force at all. Do you include avison in the number 
GARROW 4092 Doubtless there may. Do you include Davison in the number of those who you say are uot to be found in Sheffield, with any bad intention against his majesty, or the government of the country 
GARROW 4094 That is not an answer to my question
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4096 While we wait for the next witness, we will read that part of the aper called the “ Fast Day, as observed at heffield, which relates to the landing the Hessian troops—This was in the year 1794. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4097 The following Extracts were read from a printed Pamphlet, intituled,God, iti a

ATTORNEYGENERAL 4100  A Royal Proclamation having been issued, commanding February the 28th, 1794, tole observed asa General Fast, the Friends of Peace and Rerors, in Sheffield, determined to honour the Day in the most distinguished Manner. Accordingly the THOUSANDS of thut Town assembled upon a spacious plain near West-street, Backfields, where the Meeding was opened with ine 3 after whiche Serrous Lecrune, suitable to the Occasion, was read with great Energy to the immenx Concourse go, People, who listened in the most attentive Silence.

Immediately after, Recaes Camace being called to the Chair, the following Resolutions were unanimously passed, and the Meeting dissolved in that orderly and peaceable Manner, which so ennently distinguishes the patriotic Inhabitants of Sheffield, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4101 “ A Serious Lecture. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4102 “In every age of the world, the cause of truth has always met with its OppOees, whenever it chanced to clash with the interests of a venal tribe of Kings, Courtiers, Priests, and their accomplices. By reading over the 16th chapter of 1 Kings, we find that this was the case; yet the Almighty was pleased by an act of Omnipotent Power, to overturn the malice and wicked intentions of that infamous tyrant Ahab, and the Satellites who surrounded him: for, in the presence of them all (though it made against them) Truth shone forth with redoubled splendour, and the very judgment which Elijah would probably have met with, had not God been for him, fell on those 2b-‘minable Deceivers of Mankind. I refer you to the chapter itself, and without further itroduction, I shall makea few remarks on the events of that period, as it must be obvious, to every ingenuous mind, that there is a great similarity betwixt the conduct of the rulers of that day, and those of the present: therefore it may be needful to observe, ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4103 “ First, Baal’s pee could not possibly succeed, because he to whom they prayed could not help them. Baal, being a name given to an Heathen God, who had no gxise ence except in the imagination of his devotees. And adly, They had a bad cause in band, therefore, were not likely to prevail; no motives to induce them but pride; no appetites to serve, but what were sensual and devilish, so that if they had offered sacrifice to the true tad cause, they would not have ob ro tained their end—for ‘ the ears of the Lord arenot open to the cries of the foolish, but unto 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4104 I. “the wise.’ 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4105 4 “It isin this point of light, I view, with concern, a combination of Kings apparently leagued against the cause of Freedom; a combination which I believe to be odious in the sight of Heaven, although for its support we are commanded a second time from the 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4106 Throne, not of God, to fast and pray for the success of our arms over our brethren, who are struggling for every thing that is dear to 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4107 Man, and which is the will of God he should be possessed of Liserry, civil, political, and religious, Life without them is a burden. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4108 “ RESOLUTIONS. RESOLVED UNANIMOUSLY, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4109 “4. That War, the wretched artifice of Courts, is a System of Rapine and Blood, unworthy of rational beings, and utterly repughant to the mild and benevolent principles of the Christian Religion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4110 “a. That if the present war, be a war of Combined Kings against the people of France, to overthrow that Liberty which they are struggling to establish, it is, in our opinion, a war of the most diabolical kind. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4111 “3, That when public Fasts and Humiliations are ordered with the same breath, which commands the shedding of oceans of Human Blood—however they may answer the purposes of State Policy—they are solemn prostitutions of Religion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4112 “4, That the landing of Hessian troops in this country (a ferocious and unprincipled horde of Butchers) without consent of Parliament, has a suspicious and alarming appearance, is contrary to the spirit of our Constitution, and deserving of the marked indignation of every Englishman. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4113 “5. That it is high time to be upon our Guard, since these armed monsters may in a moment be let loose upon us ; particularly, as the erection of barracks throughout the kingdom may only have been an introductory measure to the filling them with Foreign Mercenaries. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4114 «6. That the high and free-born minds of Britons, revolt at the idea of such a Slavish System, and cannot be so far broken, as to kiss the hand which would chain them to its will. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4115 “7. That Peace and Liberty are the offspring of Heaven, and that Life without them is a burden, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4116 “8. That the Thanks of this Meeting are due to Earl Stanhope, for his Motion and spirited Specch for acknowledging the French Republic, and restoring Peace to our distressed country; for his Motions and able Speech in behalf of the persecuted and sufferagg patriots, Messrs. Muir, Palmer, Skirving, and Margarot, in which he nobly stood alone ; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4117 and also for the whole of his truly animated and benevolent exertions in support of the injured Rights of the People. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4118 “9. The Thanks of this Meeting are also due to Mr. Sheridan, for his nervous and eloquent Speeches in the cause of injured Patriotism, and in support of the Constitution; and also to every other Member of Parliament who has nobly stood forward at this important crisis, in support of the Constitutional Liberties of Englishmen. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4119 “10. That if any thing had been necessary to have convinced us of the total inefficacy of argument against a Ministerial Majority, the decisions which have lately taken place in Pare liament, would have fully confirmed our opinion.

And further considering, that a ee. part of the PEOPLE are unacquainted with the nature of the present WAR, either as to its justice or necessity (every endeavour being used to keep them ignorant of the real principles and design for which it was commenced) to approach and to supplicate the Omniscient Power, under such circumstances, and for such a purpose, must indeed be dreadful, since knowledge and conviction are wanting

EYRE 4734 “ Rules, Articles and- Regulations ; to be ob served by the Members of the Loyal Lambeth Association. London: Printed for the Society, 1792. 
EYRE 4735 “Whereas the fear of invasion, and civil commotions, have alarmed several of the inhabitants of this parish and its vicinity, we have thought proper to form ourselves into a military association, to be distinguished by the name of the Loyal Lambeth “issuciation, united for the defence of their country, lives and property ; and against all subverters, and levellers of peace and good order; ever ready to step forward in the above case when called upon, within the parish of St. Mary’s, Lambeth. 
BOWER 4736 Where did you say Spence’s house was 
BOWER 4738 That was the place where these associations, of the parish of Lambeth, met
BOWER 4740 Where is John Shelmerdine’s
BOWER 4742 Do you happen to know whether there was a single person, that was disciplined, either at Franklow’s or Spence’s, who was not a member of the London Corresponding Society 
BOWER 4744 Were all that you knew members of that society 
BOWER 4775 I understood you, that Hardy gave you the address of Franklow !—Yes; he gave me his card. 
BOWER 4776 Ta consequence of which you went Franklow’s, and there met this society 
BOWER 4778 I conceive when I prove that a number of persons assemble together, under the directions of the prisoner, that I can give evidence of their conversation.: 
EYRE 4779 The moment you have proved one of the terms of your proposition you are right ; at the mement it is that this association of Franklow’s was under the eckenes gel apnea undoubtedty ever’ ing t wi evidence against the: oa . meh I do not observe that the evidence g goes farther than this—in the course of trade Williams buying shoes and boots of Hardy, Hardy recommends him to Franklow, in'the way of his business, and there is no: thing that I can discover, at present, to coonect Franklow’s transaction, with r to this association, with Hardy, except so far as the: members of it, can be traced to be members of the London Corresponding Society : you have examined with a view to that, and it appeared to me that that examination rather failed, for he did not undertake to know that any of those people were members of that society. wt 
BOWER 4780 I will see if I can get the facts a hittle more distinctly—was Franklow a meow ber of the London Corresponding Society
BOWER 4782 Do you know James Davison
BOWER 4784 Do you know whether he was a member of the Corresponding Society? —I cannot take upon me to say. 
EYRE 4785 Franklow was a member of the London Corresponding Society —this association undoubtedly was formed by him, it is his creature absolutely ; and therefore that is the ground on which the transaction of that association must be fet in. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 4786 lt has already been proved that at the dinner on the 20th of January, Franklow appeared in the regimentals ef this association. 
BOWER 4789 I will prove that none were to be admitted into Franklow’s Association but members of the London Corresponding Society. 
EYRE 4790 Whether the principle will apply to the particular fact is another thing ; butit has been so often stated, that I am surprised we have not had the good fortune to make ourselves understood by the bar, because we have stated from the beginning of this trial, that there was a species of evidence, which was admissible in this case, which had no immediate relation to the prisoner; and that there was another species of evidence which had immediate relation to the prisoner—that inasmuch as the prisuner is charged with being involved in a conspiracy and some evidence being given of his having been so involved, that all the transactions of that conspiracy, to which he is not immediately a party, he will be bound by, if, upon the whole, he has consented to that geteral conspiracy; and that, therefore, all the transactions of a plot are always given in evidence, without regard to the question, whether the prisoner is proved to be concerned in those particular transactions—always with this reserve, that there must be evidence enough against the prisoner to prove him so involved in the plot, as to become seapansibie for all the parts of it—thatseems sufficiently distinct. 
EYRE 4791 But there may be a doubt whether this particular case falls withio the principle. ‘Fhe first question is—whether there is any evidence here of Franklow’s being a member of the London Corresponding Society; if the only proof of that is, that he dined in an un form at their annual dinner, I should have great difficulty about that, because, I under stand, that they were in the habit of receiving visitors as well as entertaining their own members—that being so, a man might be there without being a member of the London Corresponding Society. 
EYRE 4792 Supposing it once proved distinctly that he was a member of the London Corresponding Society, then the question will be, was hea member of the Corresponding Society, who is charged with having a great share in the whole of this transaction—is found to be associating persons together under a pretence not true in fact, of their being inhabitants of Lambeth, and associating forthe defence of the inhabitants of Lambeth; that they are furnished with arms, are learning the manual exercise, and are connected with the society, either by Franklow’s being, or being themselves members of the Corresponding Society. I cannot undertake to say, that that will not connect with the general history of this transaction; and, therefore, there may be room upon that ground to admit the evidence ; but first of all, how is the fact with regard to Franklow being a member? 
EYRE 4794 Unless the be put exactly in the condition of F; your objection is right. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 4795 Was Franklow a can low, member of the Corresponding Society 
BOWER 4797 W hether, previous to your admission into that society, you had any conversation with the prisoner about the London Corresponding Society, about providing arms for the Lambeth Association 
BOWER 4799 Were you admitted a member of the London Corresponding Society, before you were employed by the Lambeth Association
BOWER 4801 How happened you to be admitted a memof the Land Corresponding Society
BOWER 4803 Before you were admitted to the Lambeth Association, were you asked at all, whether you were a member of the London Corresponding Society 
BOWER 4805 was. 
BOWER 4806 Did Franklow know that you were
BOWER 4808 Hardy did know it
BOWER 4810 From the conversation of the members there associated. 
EYRE 4811 Enquire what the conversation was, because whether he rightly collects the effect of it or not, cannot be known with certainty. 
BOWER 4812 Tell us the substance of any conversation you have heard amongst the members of this society respecting the purposes of this association for a arliauentary reform ? 
BOWER 4814 If you ever heard any conversations of the kind, do you recollect any of the members of the society who were present? 
EYRE 4815 You said you understood from conversation amongst them, what they intended to du. Now what were those conversations, and from whom did you hear those conversations
BOWER 4817 Did you hear any thing from Franklow about a parliamentary reform 
BOWER 4819 Were you a member of the Loyal Lambeth Association 
BOWER 4821 Were you ever present with them 
BOWER 4823 Were you ever at Spence’s in Turnstile 
BOWER 4825 Were you ever there when any of the Loyat Lambeth Association were there 
BOWER 4827 Were yo ever present at any meeting of the Loyal Lambeth Association
BOWER 4829 Mr. Bower to Williams.—Did you ever hear any conversation in the presence of Franklow, from-the persons who were present there at that association
BOWER 4831 You have, in the presence of Franklow, though you do not know the persons 
BOWER 4833 I submit that it is sufficient to let in the evidence. 
GROSE 4834 But let us hear the conversation, Mr. Bower, not what he collected. j 
EYRE 4835 All that can affect Franklow by the general evidence, must be admissible. 
EYRE 4838 Nothing turns upon the question whether Hardy did or not recommendWilliams to Franklow, the ground of its admissibility is simply that Franklow was a member of the London Corresponding Society, then as a ground of the general conSpiracy, it is offered to prove that Franklow has formed an association of armed men, to which, association they will impute a design connected with this alleged conspiracy ; whatever, therefore, will fix Franklow with that, has been considered as proper evidence to shat eral charge; and the only question, therefore is, whether laying, for a moment, the imself at the bar, whether if he makes an association of persons of this description, and if there are convetsations passing in his presence, from: whence a bad design can be imputed to this association, whether that is not admissible evidence as against him? what the effect of the evidence will be, it is truly obseryed, will depend upon a thousand circumstances; whether he was attending, whether if he was attending, he approved or disapproved of it? all which may avoid the effect ef the evidence; still it seems to me that as against Franklow, and to fix upon him the having been. guilty of forming this association fora purpose, the transactions that pass in hie hearing are clearly evidence. 
EYRE 4839 Mr. Bower to Williams.—You told me Mr. Sanderson and Mr. Nodder were present at a conversation that I should have asked you to, if I had been admitted; were they present at Spence’s, Franklow’s, or Shelmerdine’s 
BOWER 4841 You are a member of the London Corresponding society 
BOWER 4843 Were you present at either Spence’s or Shelmerdine’s, and at which, at the time the last witness, bales ns there, and when persons were assembled for the purpose of bedrilled
BOWER 4845 You have been with Williams at Spence's, when the persons were assembled that he was lag and teaching the manual exercise 
BOWER 4847 ave, soner eut of the case, supposing Franklow 
BOWER 4848 When you were there, did you from any persons there, hear any conversation 
EYRE 4849 Did you say you were a member of the London Corresponding Society 
BOWER 4851 Do you know whether’ the persons who were there, were members of the London Corresponding Society or not

BOWER 4854 I cannot carry this farther, and therefore I must leave it to the sense of the Court. 
EYRE 4855 I understand the Court to have decided that you may inquire into conversations in the presence of 
EYRE 4856 ‘ranklow. 
EYRE 4858 Not what he collected. 
EYRE 4859 Mr. Bower to Williams.—Tell me any conversation you recollect when Franklow was present respecting the London Corresponding Society 
EYRE 4861 Can you recollect any part of them; how did you collect it
EYRE 4863 When they met at all, was the subject of parliamentary reform intreduced at all as 2 topic of conversation 
EYRE 4865 You meaui it was not pores conversation, not as a debate, ur any thing of that kind
EYRE 4867 But they were talking to each other
EYRE 4869 Were they talking so that Franklow beard them 
EYRE 4871 We ought to be always very correct when collecting what people said. I think you had better not press it. 
BOWER 4872 Y ou heard from Franklow thet they were to consist of sixty 
BOWER 4874 Did you hear from Franklow whether they were to have any more, or that was to be the utmost quantity they were to have

GARROW 5284 Did he state to you any of the other arguments that Moore had used with the army —. He recommended that I should mix with them, treat them with beer, and enlarge upon the severity of their usage and the smallness of their pay; but I must first sound their principles, and if I found them aristocrats, then I must not go on.

GARROW 5297 On the 12th of May. 
EYRE 5298 No, I think it would not be proper. 
GARROW 5299 Then we do not wish to examine as to any facts which have happened subsequent; I have at present confined my examination to facts prior to his being taken into custody. Do you recollect the circumstance of Mr. Hardy’s being apprehended 
GARROW 5301 Had you any conversation with respect to admission to the House of Commons? If that was after Hardy was apprehended, I do not inquire into it 
GARROW 5303 Do you remember a paper being distributed with respect to the Ins and the Outs 
GARROW 5305 Where was that distributed? — At the meeting at the Coach and Horses, in Hattonlen.

EYRE 5351 You had better answer the question. 
EYRE 5352 I carried on the business of a hair-dresser in that name, for I believe pretty near seven years. Where did Pha reside

EYRE 5355 When did you first come to live in Petty France, No. 3, as a hair-dresser, by the name of Douglas
EYRE 5357 I am not very particularas to dates, I do not want to be in any of your secrets, if there can be any reason in the world for your not choosing to answer me —Had you any at ticular reason for changing your namef—I will state my reason; my father had a shop of business in the city, his business was chiefly in the wig and shaving way; for improvement I wished to go to the west end of the town. I went and worked with a man, whose name was Penton, in Bloomsbury, for improvement; it was, perhaps, trom false pride I did not choose it to be known that I was working as 4 journeyman, when my father kept four of five men; and as for taking the name of Douglas, I took it from aj play-bill. I have no objection to a decent pride, you took a very good name. It struck you ina}

EYRE 5374 Did you give him a note for it 
EYRE 5376 id, part my wife paid, and the remainder ie has been since paid. 
EYRE 5377 When did you pay part of it yourself
EYRE 5379 Did not Mr. Lincoln come into the London toffee-house by mere accident, where the Witnesses for the crown are, I believe, provided with what is fit for them to have, and gaw you there, and said, how do you do Douglas(—Permit me to explain, that that was Botthe way; that wouldcarry a different construction from the manner in which it was done. Mr. Macnamara first came himself, whem I never had seen; he asked me quesfons; I told him a stair-case there with a manIhad never seen, was not a place to enter into an explanation upon the subject. 
EYRE 5380 Tam not speaking about Mr. Macnamara, but asking what passed when Mr. Lincoln came into the London coffce-house 
EYRE 5382 Mr. Macnamara had been there before, and hed behaved in-such a manner that you were 8 flurried that you did not know what you said to Mr. Lincoln when he came in 
EYRE 5384 But you recollect what you said to me, not two minutes ago; that Mr. Macnamara had been there before, and had behaved in such a fsanner, that when Mr. Lincoln came, you were so confused, from Mr. Macnamara’s conduct, that you hardly knew what yousaid
EYRE 5386 He said to you, how do youdo Douglas 
EYRE 5388 What would be brought forward 
EYRE 5390 Did. you know where Mr. Lincoln lived in the interval, between the time when you borrowed the money from bim and to the time you saw Mr. Macnamara and Mr. Lincoln at the London coffee-house
EYRE 5392 Had you seen him in the interval
EYRE 5394 Let me ask an explanation of something, which I confess I did not understand; how came you to say ty Mr. Worship that yoa dealt in naval stures
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5396 Do you mean Worship, the engraver 
EYRE 5490 A charge brought when and where 
GARROW 5498 I submit to your lordship that is the only answer a witness can make to such a question. 
EYRE 5499 There is no occasion for your interrupting the examination ; probably, it is an answer; but he may be pressed to see whether he can answer farther or not. 
EYRE 5523 Consider whether it will be prudent to go into an examination upon that; if Mr. Macnamara has been so imprudentas to go into a coffee-house, and talk to the witness, it would be at best an incautious thing for a gentleman to go where the crown witnesses are, to enter into conversation with them ; and, I think, it had better not be done ; I hope no other gentleman will do it. 
GARROW 5525 I shall examine to it. 
GARROW 5626 You said Worship produced an engraving at one of the meetings; cast your eye upon that paper; is that one of the engravings he preduced [showing the witnessa copper-plate print of the manual exercise.]
GARROW 5628 brought it to the society, that they might see it. 
GARROW 5629 What have the soldiers got upon their heads 
GARROW 5631 This is an engraving of the manual exercise, and of platoon firing
GARROW 5633 When you applied to him, lest he should Suspect you were connected with a magistrate, you told him you were a dealer in naval stores 
GARROW 5635 And afterwards, in the rest of: the conversation, you kept up that representation
GARROW 5637 How long is it ago since you gave a note to Mr Lincoln, Mc Macnamara's Agent
GARROW 5639 Did you give it to Mr. Macnamara, or to Mr. Lincoln 
GARROW 5641 How much was the amount 
GARROW 5643 How much, at this moment is due upon that note 
GARROW 5645 Have you ever had any application from Mr. Macnamara, for the money, till after attending this court, in virtue of his majesty’s writ of subpoena, and anrong the witnesses for the crown 
GARROW 5647 I need hardly ask you, whether you had had any personal application from Mr. Macnamara, to pay this money 
GARROW 5649 Had youhad any application, upon his part, till you were subpcenaed as a witness 
GARROW 5651 How long ago 
GARROW 5653 Did Mr. Macnamara come to you alone 
GARROW 5655 He said he came out of hamanity to you
GARROW 5657 If what
GARROW 5659 Did Mr. Macnamara demand the money, or desire you to pay it ? —He asked me, if I remembered the circumstance ; I said it was an improper place to enter into an explanation ; I did not know Mr. Macnamara’s person; I told him, if he did, I must meet it in court. 
GARROW 5660 You have been asked a vast number of questions, respecting Mrs. Coleman’s will; was there any suit instituted to dispute the legality of that will 
GARROW 5662 Was there any prosecution for that which is called the forgery of it
GARROW 5664 Was there ever, to your knowledge, any complaint made against you, that there was any thing foul in the transaction 
GARROW 5666 Was it, upon your oath, 2 fair, honest transaction, as far as you had any thing to do with it; aye or no 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5668 Y our lordship will recollect that Mr. Gosling, last night, spoke of a conversation, in Newgate, at which persons of the names of Roussel and Hillier were pean We are now going to prove, that ussel was a member of the London Corresponding Society, with a view to produce some papers found upon him. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5669 Did you find that paper 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5671  19th July, 1792. “ Division 37, Number 47; Mr. Roussel, No. 4, Shepherd-street, New Bond-street. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5672 Look at that book (showing the witness a pamphict, intituled, “ Explanation of an Encain of the Manual Exercise and Platoon iring ] has that your hand-writing upon it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5674 Where did you find that 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5676 Look at that song [showing it to the witness]
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5678 Where was Roussel’s apartment 
EYRE 5687  I wish it had been observed before. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5689 I submit to your lordship, that the book must be evidence ; because the book, your lordship sees, is an explanation of the pareve plate, which has been produced, and which was found before the pons was in custody. 
EYRE 5692 The other was found before ; the material objection is, that this may have been printed afterwards; it was found afterwards, and there is no evidence of its existence before; therefore it must be rejected, unless you are prepared to show, that the printing existed before. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5693 The papers Iam now going to produce were found, one in the custody of Mr.Martin, the other of Mr. Thelwall; they were found in their custody certainly after the prisoner was apprehended, but they bear date in April, 1794; and they appear, upon the face of them, to have been prepared for the Chalk Farm meeting. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5695 Supposing the objection to be well founded, which I do not admit, I believe I can prove, that the paper had an actual existence in the month of April, 1794. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 5697 I will prove, that they existed in the possession of Mr. Martin.

LAW 5790 “ At a General Mecting of the London Corres“ ponding Society, Aed on the Green, at “ Chalk Farm, on Monday the 14th of April, “1794, J. Lovett in the Chater, the follow“ing Letters were read : 
LAW 5791 “ To the Chairman of the Society of the Friends of the People. 
LAW 5792  Sir; At a crisis so important as the pre-, 
LAW 5793 sent there needs no apology on the part of the London Corresponding Society,’ for addressing itself to all other associated societies, who have in view the same object as themselves. To the ‘ Society of the Friends of the “ People,’ arguments are not wanting to show the importance and absolute necessity of a full and fair representation of the people of Great Britain. They have investigated the subject for themselves; they have exposed to the world a series of plain and indisputable facts, which must excite in the mind of every man well disposed to his country, apprehensions of alarm for the security of the few remaining vestiges of liberty, from which, as Britons, we derive consolation. Deeply impressed with considerations of this nature, the London Corresponding Society earnestly solicits, at this time, tle concurrence and assistance of the Society of the Friends of the People, in assembling, as speedily as the nature of the business will admit, a Coavention of the Friends of Freedom, for the purpose of obtaining, in a legal and constitutional method, a full and effectual representation. 
LAW 5794 ‘ Our request is not made from the impressions of the moment, but after the maturcst deliberations on the value and importance of the object for which we are contending, and of the difficulties we may expect fram those whose present interests render them hostile to the welfare of their country. 
LAW 5795 he opposition of such persons is no small argument for the goodness of our cause ; and their late conduct when compared with their former professions, exhibits a depravity, leled, we trust, on the page of history. 
LAW 5796 “ Under the a ay of apostate reformers, we have lately beheld serious and alarming encroachments on the liberties of the people. 
LAW 5797 “ We have seen with indignation and horror men legally and peaceubly assembled, dispersed by unconstitutional powers, and: their papers seized. 
LAW 5798 “ We have scen some of our most virtuous brethren, whose only crime has been an imi. tation of Mr. Prrr and his associates, sentenced to fourteen years transportation, without the sanction of law or even of precedent, of which number, one was held up in the British parliament as convicted and condemned, before he was even put upon his trial. 
LAW 5799 he insidious attempts also to introduce forcign troops into this country, without the consent of parliament, and the intended bill to embody foreigners into his majesty’s service, are measures suthciently calculated to awaken our fears for the existence even of the name of liberty. Nor can we overlook that part of the present system of corupeih, which maintains out of the public plunder, train of spies, more dangerous to society than so many assassins, whose avowed business is to destroy the friends of the country, one by one, 
LAW 5800 “ These are grievances which demand im mediate redress, and when added to thos evils which are necessarily connected with every partial representation of the people, cs! for the strenuous exertions of every live Cs his country. 
LAW 5801 “ But we are told that the present is not the time for reform, and that innovation may introduce disturbance. Are those persons to judge of the proper time to make returm, who exist only by corruption? Are the people of Britain to endure every thing without repining, without ardently seeking a radical reform, because disturbances may happen? Have the enemies to reform told us whence these disturbances are to originate? Mas a single overt act been committed by the friends to freedom? Have not all the riots, all the public disturbances, all the seditious assem lies been excited by the enemies to reform? And do they mean to tell us that they will still find other instruments for their wicked designs ; that they have yet those who will act over avain the outrages that have been perpetrated in some parts of Britain, and attempted in others ? 
LAW 5802 f such is the determination of those persons hostile to a fair representation, et them look to the consequences, but let them recollect that it has happened, and may happen again, that those who kindled the flames have perished by them. 
LAW 5803 “ The friends to reform are friends to peace, their principles can be promoted only by peaceable means, they know of no other me thod of obtaining the object they desire. But they will not be alarmed by the threats ot venal apostates, they will not draw back because they have seen some of their best friends doomed to exile. They will pursue the course in which they have begun, and turn neither to the right nor to the left. 
LAW 5804 “ Convinced as the London Corresponding Society is, that as there is no power which ought, so there is no power which oan finally withstand the just and steady demands of 3 people resolved to be free ; they will thesefare look with confidence to the determination, and they hope to the co-operation of the ‘ Suciety of the Friends of the People, m the attainment of an object which involves the dearest interests of society. 
LAW 5805 “ Convinced also that their intentions are of the purest kind, they will never stoop to answer the calumnies of their enemies; but will at all times, and in all circumstances, endeavour, by firmness and perseverance, to deserve the countenance and approbation of the best friends of their country, the friends of a fair Representation of the People of Great Britain. —I am, sir, tor the London Corresponding Society, ‘THOMAS HARDY, Scc. 
LAW 5806 “ April 4, 1794. 
LAW 5807 “ COMMITTEE ROOM, 
LAW 5808 “ Frith-street, April t1, 1794. 
LAW 5809 s¢ Sir, Your letter of the 4th instant, addressed to Mr. Snertpan, chairman of: the FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE, was laid before that SOCIETY at their meeting on Saturday last; and they instructed their committee to thank the LONDON CORRESPONDING SOCIETY for their communication, and to express the alarm they feel in common with every Friend ot Liberty, at the late extraordinary proceedings of Government, so ably detailed, and so justly reprobated by your Society. They assure you that all the Friends of Reform, may ‘look with confidence “to the determination and co-operation’ of this society in every peaccable and constitutional measure, which shall appear to them calculated to promote the object of their institution; but they do not think that which is recommended in your letter, is likely to serve its professed purpose. ‘They fear it will furnish the Enemies of Reform with the means of calumniating its advocates, and so far from forwarding the cause, will deter many from eountenancing that which they approve. For these reasons, the Friends of the People must decline to send Delegates to the convention proposed by the London Corresponding Soeiety : at the same time they renew their assurances of good will, and desire of preserving a proper understanding and cordiality among all the Friends of Parliamentary Reform, notwithstanding any difference of opinion that may occur as to the best method ef accomplishing it
LAW 5811 Was that letter from the Friends of the People read there 
LAW 5813 How was it received? — With universal silence, I believe; I do not recollect any approbation of it. “ Do you recollect any marks of the contrary 
LAW 5815  The following RESOLUTIONS were then N passed Unanimously : 
LAW 5816 Resolved Unanimously,—1. That this society have beheld with rising indignation, prepemone’d to the enormity of the evil, the jate rapid advancesof despotism in Britain; the invasion of public security, the contempt of popular opinion, and the violation of all those provisions of the Constitution intended to protect ‘the People against the encroachments of Power and Dreetistive, ; 
LAW 5817 “2. That our abhorrence and detestation have been particularly called forth by the late arbitrary and flagitious proceedings of the Court of Justiciary-in Scotland, where all the doctrines and practices of the Star Chamber, in the times of Charles the 1st, Have ‘beer revived and aggravated ; and where sentences have been pronounced in open violation of all law and justice, which must strike deep into the heart of every man, the melancholy conviction that BriTons ARE NO LONGER FREE. 
LAW 5818 “3. That the whole proceedings of the late British Convention of the People at Edinburgh, are such as claim our approbation ana applause. 
LAW 5819 4, That the conduct of citizens Mancaror and Gerratop in particular, by its strict conformity with our wishes and instructions, and the ability, firmness, and disinterested triotism which it so eminently displayed, a inspired an enthusiasm of Zeal and Attachment which no time can obliterate, and no persecution remove; and that'we will preserve their names engraven on‘our hearts till we have an opportunity to redress theiy wrongs. 
LAW 5820 «5. That any attempt to violate those yet remaining laws, which were intended for the security of Englishmen against the Tyranny ot Courts and Ministers, and ‘the Corruption of dependent Judges, by vesting in such Judges a legislative or arbitrary power (such as has lately been exercised by the Court of Justiciary in Scotland) ought to be considered as dissolving entirely the social compact between the English nation and their Governors; and driving them to an immediate appeal to that incontrovertible maxim of eternal justice, that the safety of the people is the suPREME, and in cases of necessity, the ONLY law, 
LAW 5821 “6. That the arming and disciplining in this country, either with or without the consent of parliament, any bands of emigrants and foreigners, driven from their own country Jor their known attachment to an INFAMOUS DESPOTISM, is an outrageous attempt to orer awe and intimidate the free spirit of Britons; to subjugate them to an army of mercenary cut-throats, whose views and interest must of necessily be in direct opposition to those of the Nation, and that xo pretence whatever eucnt to induce the people to submit to so unconstitutional a measure. 
LAW 5822 “6. That the unconstitutional projevt of raising money and troops by forced benevo lences (and no benevolences collected upon fequisition from the king or his ministers can ever in reality be voluntary) and the equally unjustifiable measure of arming one part 0! the people against the other, brought Charles the first to the block, and drove James the second and his posterity from the throne; and that consequently ministers in advising such measures, ought to consider whether they are not guilty of high treason. 
LAW 5823 “8. That this society have beheld with’ 
LAW 5824 considerable pleasure the consistent respect which the House of Lords displayed for their own constitutional rules and orders, on the 4th of the present month, upon the motion of Earl Stanhope, concerning the interference of ministers in the internal government of France; and that it is the firm conviction of this society, that this circumstance when properly detailed, will have a considerable effect in convincing the country at large, of the true dignity and utility of that branch of HIS MAJESTY’s PARLIAMENT. -“9. That the thanks of this meeting be given to Eart Stanuore, for his manly and patriotic conduct during the present session of parliament ; a conduct whic! (ueeyperteal as at has been in the senate, of which ne is so truly. honourable a member) has, together with the timely interference of certain spirited and patriotic associations, been nevertheless already productive of the salutary effect of chasing the Hessian and Hanoverian Mercenaries from our coasts; who, but for these exertions, might have been marched perhaps, ere this, intu the very heart of the country, together with others of their countrymen, to have peopled the sarracxs, which every where insult the eyes of Britons. 
LAW 5825 “ 40. That it is the firm conviction of this society, that a steady perseverance in the same bold and energetic sentiments, which have lately been avowed by the Friends of Freedom, cannot fail of crowning with ultimate triumph, the virtuous cause in which we are engaged; since whatever may be the interested opinion of hereditary senators, or acked majorities of pretended representatives, tuth and Liberty, in an age soen lightened as the Present, must be Invincible and Omnipotent. 
LAW 5826 “ This Society having already addressed M. Margarot, their Delegate, an ADDRESS to JOSEPH GERRALD was read as follows, and carried unanimously. 
LAW 5827 o JOSEPH GERRALD, a prisoner senfenced by the High Court of Justiciary of Scotland, to Transportation d the Seas for FOURTEEN YEARS? 
LAW 5828 “ We behold in you our beloved and rewet friend and fellow-citizen, a Martyr to the Glorious Cause of Equal Representation, and we cannot permit you to leave this degraded country without expressing the infinite obligations the people at large, and we in particular, owe to you for your very spirited exer— tions m that cause upon every occasion ; but upon nene more conspicuously, than during fthe sitting of the Britis Convention of the
LAW 5829 PEOPLE at Edinburgh, and the consequent proceeding (we will not call it trial) at the ber of the Court of Justiciary. 
LAW 5830 “We know not which most deserves our admiration, the splendid talents with which you are so eminently distinguished, the exalted virtues by which they have been directed, the perseverance and undaunted firmness which you so nobly displayed in resisting the wrongs of your insulted and oppressed country, or your present manly and philosophical suffering under an arbitrary, and till of late unprecedented sentence: a sentence one of the most vindictive and cruel that has been pronounced since the days of that most infamous and ever-to-be-detested Court of Star-Chamber, the enormous tyranny of which cost the first Charles his head. 
LAW 5831 o you and your associates we feel ourselves most deeply indebted. For us it is that you are suffering the sentence of transportation with felons, the vilest outcasts af society! For us it is that you are doomed to the inhospitable shores of New Holland ; where, however, we doubt not you will experience considerable alleviation by the remembrance of that vinrvous conpuct for which it is imposed on you, and by the sincere regard and esteem of your fellow citizens. 
LAW 5832 “ The equal laws of this country have, for ages past, been the boast of its inhabitants; but whither are they now fled? We are animated by the same sentiments, are daily repeating the same words, and committing the same actions for which you are thus infamously sentenced ; and we will repeat and commit them until we have obtained redress; 
LAW 5833 et we are unpunished! either therefore the law is unjust towards you in inflicting Py nishment on the exertions of Virtue and Telents, or it ought not to deprive us of cur share in the story of the Martyrdom. 
LAW 5834 “ We again, therefore, pledge ourselves to you and to our country, never to cease demanding our rights from those who have usurped them, until having obtained an Equal Representation of the People, we shall be enabled to hail you once more with triumph to your native country. We wish you Health and Happiness; and be assured we never, never shall forget your Name, your Vir tues, nor YouR Great ExamPte.

LAW 5992 Look at that paper, and say, whether that is the paper that was read at the meeting in February last, at your division? —This paper I am very sure was delivered; I need not look at the contents, because there are my initials upon it. Itwasread] . “RIGHTS OF SWINE; “ An Address tothe Poor. Printed in the year 1794. “ Talso will show mine opinion. 
LAW 5993 a method founde to prevent the poor from wanting bread, be the state of trade whatever it ma are the ence? moulded into many shapes for the use of mai but chiefly into bread, which is the staff o life; and from grass, we derive our flesh milk, butter, cheese, &c. besides wool an leather, which, I think, with the addition 9 coal, and a few other mincrals nearly makeup the real necessaries of life. 
LAW 5994 “Ward indeed must be the heart which ig unaffected with the present distress experienced by the poor in general in this commers cial nation. Thousands of honest and industrious people in Great Britain are literally starving for want of bread; and the cause invariably assigned is a stagnant commerce, My opinion on this subject will perhaps ape pear to some a strange phenomena—it is, that a stagnant commerce is not the real cause of the want of the necessaries of life among the laborious poor. And I am confident, that, while the ‘ Earth lone her increase,’ there ig on Justice aud Reason, n the first place, then, I will ask, what rincipal sources of human subsist. Sertainly corn and grass. Corn ig ask again then, who is so infatuated ag to say, that the growing of corn or grass, ia dependent on, or connected with, the perity or adversity of trade? Certainly (thank Heaven!) they are not affected by the devouring sword, or ruined commerce (except at the. seat of war.)—Corn grows not in the loom, nor grass upon the anvil! Why isit, then, that while there is plenty of bread the poor are starving? Is there not as much grain in the land as when the trade fonsiabed? 
LAW 5995 pose trade were to rise immediately to an amazing degree, would it make one grain of corn or blade of grass? Certainly not. Why then, I ask again, are the poor, who are the 
LAW 5996 TOS 
LAW 5997 ? Suppeculiar care of Him who delights to da his heedy creatures good, not satisfied with the good of the land 
LAW 5998 “ The following reasons are at least satisfactory to myself : Because, in the time of national prosperity, house and land rent (consequently provisions) are always raised by the, wealthy and voluptuous, till they are, at least, at par with high wages; but, when Waa, or. any other cause, has ruined or impeded commerce, and reduced sues penis and provia sions remain unabated. The poor callicoweavers in the vicinity af Manchester, notoriously illustrate thig argument, as they are now (they who can get any) working for fifty and sixty per cent. less wageathan at this time twa years back, and the necessaries of life are, rather augmented in their prices than dimir nished!! : 
LAW 5999 “ Hearken, O ye poor of the Land! While great men have an unbounded power to raise their rents and your provisiona, and, at the same time, an uncontrolled power to make War, and consequently to dry up, or diminish, the sources of your income, your subsistence will, at tha beat, be precerjaus, and your very existence often miserable !—The present want of bread amongst the poor, is not owing to the want of grain in the world, nor, I presume, in this land, but owing to the price of it being excessively above the price of labour. When, therefore, the price of labour cannot be brought up to the rate of provisions, provisions should be reduced to the rate of labour. Till this is practicable, the poor are miserable ! 
LAW 6000 During the last twenty years, mechanical wages have been varied, according to circumstances, several times, and not unusually in some branches, twenty, thirty, forty, and even fifty per cent
LAW 6002 What can be more odious in the sight of heaven, than feast and famine in the same nation? Yet this is literally the case in this kingdom, at this moment, and not only in the nation, but in every town, in every street, yea, often under the very same roof!

LAW 6004 “ Open your eyes, O ye poor of the iand! 
LAW 6005 —in vain are your hands and your mouths open! Do you not see how you are cajoled and degraded, by the paltry subscriptions made for you, at different times and in various parts of the nation; which serve only to make poe slavery more servile, and your misery of longer duration? I revere gencrous subscribers collectors, but I scorn the means! Ye poor, take a farther look into your rights, and you will see, that, upon the principles of 
LAW 6006 Teason and justice, every peaceable and useful person has a right, yea, a “ Divine Right to be satisfied with the good of the land! Besides, is it not monstrously provoking to be robbed by wholesale, and relieved by retail! Look again, and you will see that public collections, subscriptions, and charities, are nothing more than the appendages of corruption, extortion, and oppression ! If the benevolent Father of the universe did not send amongst mankind provisions enough, and more than foneh, such is the waste of the great and the gluttonous, that many of you poor, would get none at all! Say not, therefore, ye oppressed, “ there ts a famine, or scarcity of provisions in the land!" It would be false. the Jand contains plenty; and if provisions were (as they ought‘to be) reduced to your wages, you would enjoy your unquestionable right, a comfortable sufficiency. 
LAW 6007 “ But, besides the destruction of your trade, and the means of subsistence, you have the mortification to sec your bread eaten by dragoon and hunting horses, spanicls, &c. and your parental, affectionate, loving, provident and tender guardians, can give yous good reason why—it is their own !

EYRE 6162 There can be no imputation upon you for answering the question ; if you decline answering, that is another thing ; it exposes you to no difficulties, or penalty, or any thing of that sort. None; it is only a point of delicacy. I am ready to give an answer, I have not the least objection on my part. 
LAW 6163 My lord, I take it that the channels for information must be protected. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6164 The court of exchequer never would permit that question to be asked. 
EYRE 6165 Upon a general principle I do not know whether it ought to e answered. 
EYRE 6166 Mr. Groves
EYRE 6169 He has said what is proper and material for your purpose : that is, that he went there, being employed for the purpose of collecting information, with a view to the disclosure of it. 
EYRE 6171 I do not think it is proper. 
EYRE 6175 It is hardly proie that the history of a connexion of that ind should be disclosed here. 
EYRE 6176 Groces
EYRE 6179 You find he went on purpose togive information of what passed ; that is the only fact that is material for the prisoner; the rest is private intercourse, which may involve in it the consideration of a thousand other things, which may be material to the government ofthe country. I think it not proper to be disclosed here, itis not necessary to the cause. 
EYRE 6180 Mr. Groves
LAW 6186 He did not state any title. 
EYRE 6188 There should be no name given to a witness on his examination: he states what he went for, and in making observations on the evidence, you may give it any appellation you please. You recollect I made the observation before, when Mr. Erskine did the same thing. 
EYRE 6190 Go on. 
EYRE 6201 Mr. Gibbs, Iam sorry to interrupt you, but your cuestions ought not to be accomp:nied with those sort of comments: they are the proper sulyects of observation when the defence is made. The business of a cross-examination is to ask to all sorts of acts, to probe a wilness as closely as you can ; but it is not the object of a cross-examination, to introduce that kind of periphrasis as you have just done. 
EYRE 6202 sc 
EYRE 6210 I should be extremely sorry if it should be supposed that I mean to make an observation that seemed to press personally upon either of the learned counsel who are now for the defendant, and particularly on the gentleman who is now cross-examining this witness, and more particularly if it were supposed I was capable of doing that in the absence of the other counsel; I hope that will never be imagined of me. 
EYRE 6211 With regard to the point, I think itis so clear that the questions that are put are not to be loaded with all the observations that arise upon all the previous parts of the case, they tend so to distract the attention of every bods, they load us in point of time so much, and that that is not the time for observation upon the character and situation of a witness is s6 apparent, that as a rule of evidence it ought never to be departed trom ; but it is certainly true that it dues slide into examinations, and that it is very often not taken notice of, and it saves more time frequently to let it pass than to take notice of it; but there is a rule to which all those sort of things, if once an appeal is made to the Court, ought to be brought, and my judgment is, that after you have got the particular facts upon which that sort of observation is founded, the examination ought to preed to the other facts upon the case, and the observations upon those furmer facts ought to make part of the defence. 
EYRE 6213 I will never suffer it to prevail on either side; but as far asf would indulge it, it should be on the part of s defendant. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6405 Did you find any thing in the possession of a person of the name of Hillier 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 6407 You told us yesterday that you were at Edinburgh when the Scotch convention sat and was dispersed

EYRE 6646 “ Sir, Honoured with, and happy in the confidence of a number of my countrymen, I have their request to transmit officially to his majesty’s ministers, two addresses jomed in one, and containing together the reasons why we have associated for a parliamentary reform, and the legal and peaceable methods hy which we hope to maintain it. 
EYRE 6647 “So sanctioned, I must also inform you that this letter, and these addresses, equally speak the sentiments of some thousands of industrious citizens, in this capital; and of a far greater number dispersed throughout the island, there not being a single-corner of it (Rotten Boroughs excepted) but cries aloud for reform. Contig in the justice of our claim, in the merits of our peaceable demeanour, and our ready obedience to all the laws of our country, we imagine ourselves clear from all charge or imputation of sedition, rebellion, conspiracy or treason ;. and that in pursuing what no one can deny to be our right, we are entitled to every protection and support of vernament
EYRE 6649 “ Equally known by his activity as by his knowledge of the ned an honest i irate, whose spies had well informed him of the nature of our meetings, has acknowledged that they were peaceable, innocent, and consrituTionat, and further admits the necessity of a reform : at your hands, sir, I therefore, demand justice and protection for the society against all ruffians, who, let loose on the pate have dared, or shall henceforward dare, the satellites of ancient sanguinary tyrants, assume to themselves the double office of making laws and executingthem. Certain that such an iniquitous system cannot originate ina British cabinet, we exclaim, may perdition light equally upon such vile miscreants, and upon their employers ! 
EYRE 6650 “Were we, according to the hackneyed custom, to recur to precedents, we should say, that Mr. Pitt, and the duke of Richmond, have themselves traced out the path which we now yates that they themselves have asserted the rights of Britons, to a fair, equal, and adequate representation in parliament— that they, themselves, had invited us to associate and discuss our rights; and we might add, that in so doing, they spoke, they acted like honest men, they were not then in office.” 
EYRE 6651 “But the Rights of the People being ever the same, such precedents and such supporters are superfluous. However, as things seen through the medium of power, have a very different aspect from what they wore when those worthy gentlemen were on the other side of the question, it is not altogether improbable that severities may be bad recourse to, to quell that desire for reform which they themselves have raised. Should that be the case, I beg it as a favour, or rather, peng 5 the foremost rank, claim it as my right, the attack may commence upon me. Whenever extraordinary measures may be adopted, I earnestly wish to be the first of the society in feeling the effects of them, and shall deem it not a proud, but an honourable Gay, in which I shall be called upon to plead the cause of my fellow citizens against oppression.

EYRE 6710 Who proposed to publish that declaration? —This was a matter that was brought forward by some one of the delegates at the meeting, upon every thing of that sort that was proposed, the opinion was taken of every delegate, one after another, and in the course of taking that opinion, there were two of the divisions, or two of those delegates, that objected to it. 
EYRE 6711 Did that stop it

BOWER 7188 Paid not mean to do any thing of the kind, but understanding the society was on a public 
BOWER 7189 I should much obliged to them for one of theirresolutions, and then I should leave them to their own deliberations. 
BOWER 7190 Then you were admitted a member in conuence of what you had observed 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7224 I should suppose it was that of the 2d of May 
EYRE 7258 I think you mav say that it was or not toa magistrate 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7261 I object to that question being put ; the principle which admits that it ought not to be asked if it were to a magistrate, admits that it ought not to be asked as to any body else ; for my part J cannot see what it has todo with the justice of the case. 3 
EYRE 7263 It is perfectly right that all opportunities should be given to discuss the truth of the evidence given against a prisoner; but there is a rule whieh has universally obtained on account of its impostance to the public for the detection of crimes, that those persons who are the channel by means of which that detection is made, should not be unnecessarily disclosed: if it can be made appear that really and truly it is neeessary to the investigation of the truth ef the case that the name of the person should be disclosed, I should be very unwilling to stop it, but it does not appear to me that it is withia the ordinary ceurse to do it, or that nally put, your lordsbips will permit me first to state what was the fact at the time that this objection arose. My learned friend asked the witness, whether the person to whom he made the Communication was or was not a magietrate? As 1 understood the answer of the witness, it was to this effect; that he ghere is any necessity for it in this particularcase; all that this witness say6 is, I did this upon advice; I did from time to time communicate with a friend for the purpose of its being communicated to & magistrate, and in that manner it was that I eame to know these transactions. 
EYRE 7264 If there is a rule that the channel by which those communications are made should not be disclosed, that rule I think will extend to this case: I rather think that we have this day determined that there is such a rule, 
EYRE 7265 I cannot satisfy myself that there is any substantial distinction between the ease of this man’s going to a justice of the peace, Or oing to a magistrate superior to a justice of the watched by those whose duty it was to attend to it, The question immediately put upon that was, ifit wasneta magistrate, who was it? 
EYRE 7266 Now I know I ought tostate with great dif fidence, any opinion of mine upon a question of evidence, not having for years any of the courts of law, not knowing what the practice of the courts is at thie day, and not being therefore able to state from principle what rule is to be deduced from that practice ; but in the course of the early period of my life I have had a good deal to do with this sort of business in the courts of law, and lordships, the way in which the question was I beg humbly to state my own opinion, that put to the witness by Mr. Erskine, sas inif the rule with respect to asking & question order to sift his credit, whether what he saidof a witness be that he is to disclose the now was what be had always said; he askedchannel of communication to a magistrate, him this, not who employed him, but whotherthat a question porotng at persons who stand he had communicated to any body what hein situations, where they cannot be strietly had observed at the meetings of these socie- stated as acting as magistrates, but at the ties; his answer was, that be had eommuni-same time bave respect to the publie office of cated it to a friend: Now with great submis- magistracy, 18question that is not to be put. sion to your lordships, it is the common| My friend says, ought I not to try the practice, that when a man’s credit is sifted by credit of the witness? 1 happen, in the habit being asked whether he bas ever told theof my own profession for the last six years, 10 same story to another person, and he says heknow the practice in the court fof exchequer ; bas told jt toa particular person, he is alwaysit is 2 sort ‘of thing that occurs every dmyself.a asked who that particular person in, if thewitness say, L had an information that the gentleman who is examining him thinks it defendant bad committed an offence againet worth while to press the examination to thatthe revenue laws, for which he would incur a extent. forfeiture of thirty thousand pounds, if 
EYRE 7267 Ibelieve inchoose so to state it, What is the principle general, where it is not at all accompaniedupon which the Court says, you shal] never ask with the circumstance of its being a channel where he got that information? It may be of communication to government for discosaid, it is necessary I should know this, very, that what you say is true; and the only because it may be extremely essential in trying uestion is, whether there be such a rule forthe credit of the witness who speaks to other the sake of enabling the crown to watch overfacta, that I may know his credit as to other and detect grcat oliences, the channels offacts, by trying how far he is credible to the communication are not to be disclosed. Iffacts he states of A.or B. But what says a there be no such rule as that, your proposition court of justice? A court of justice does not is right: it appears to me that there is such asit to catch the little whispers or the huzaas of rule, and that we have this day determined popularity; it proceeds upon reat principles that such a rule exists; and I do not feel a of general justice; it says that individuals distinction between this case and that. must suffer inconveniences, rather than great Lord Chief Baron Macdonald
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7270 I am sure I am consequence must be, that great erimes will addressing a Court that will always excuse & be passed over without any information being counsel, in any situation, who is acting upon offered about them, or without persons taking public grounds, if he should happen to be that part which is always a disagreeable part mistaken. I submit to your lordships, thatto take, but which at the same time it is the question which Mr. Erskine was about tonecessary should be taken for the interest of ut to the witness, is not aquestion to be put. the public. I say then, that the objection to W ith respect to what has been stated, as thethe yestion now proposed to be put,—always principle upon which the question was origi-stating that objection with the utmost deference to your lordships, which I do from a sense of duty founded upon what I think the clearest principle of duty to every individual who forms a part of the community—I state this—that after the witness has distinctly said that he mentioned this to a person who was to communicate it to those who would necessarily take care of the interests of society, in consequence of that information being communicated, that that channel of communication brings the name ofthat person within the tule the Court has laid down. 
GROSE 7273 “J am satisfied that from the quarter where I gave my information the societies would be known; I believe those were the words. 
EYRE 7274 I have it thus: “ He made a report to one, who, he was certain, would communicate it, but not toa istrate. 
EYRE 7276 He did so. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7278  Most surely. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7284 I really must object to the question. 
EYRE 7291 There is some doubt in the court how the fact stands; whether, in consequence of the first advice that he received from his friend, he disclosed those circumstances to the same friend, by whom he supposes it to be communicated regularly to some magistrate; or whether he applicd to some other person. I understood him that he applied to some other person himself. 
MACDONALD 7292 My reason for wishing him to be asked, whether the person, to whom he originally made the comMunication, was a istrate or not, was exactly upon the same principle as my lord chief justice now states. I could wish it to be distinctly known, whether the person to whom he first mentioned it was the person who communicated it to a magistrate, or a person who simply advised him to communicate it to a magistrate. ay. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7293 I wish to have it understood that the objection I now take is this: That Mr. Erskine has no right to ask the witness who it was that advised him to ive the information to a person who stands in the situation of a magistrate; for, I say, the person by whose advice the information is given, is to all intents and purposes, the informer. I wish to explain myself; who this person was, and what effect it may have in the evidence, it may be impertinent to sug gest; what it is intended to prove, really I not know; but your lordships will recollect that I stand here as the prosecutor for the public ; if I were in my own cause I could sacrifice, at my own pleasure, principles which appear to me to be the principles of public justice ; but, in the situation in which I stand, I do not know how I can regulate my conduct better towards the public, and towards thepaca than by acting upon the principles of law, as Iunderstand them, admitting at the same time, that no man is more likely to be mistaken: but this I will say distinctly, that I would not trouble your lordship with the ob jection that I am now stating, if I were not rfectly convinced, upon the best judgment Pax form, that the question cannot be put to the witness; and 1 mean, according to my duty, and with very humble deference to your lordships, to beg to have your lordships’ opinion. — 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7294 I know very well that it may be strongly argued, as it is very strongly argued by my learned friends, why, how are we to find out whether a witness does or does not speak truth, if we cannot ask him this sort of question—who advised you to do so and su?

ATTORNEYGENERAL 7296 In the Court of Exchequer it unquestionably happens every day, that a witness says I received an information that there were run-goods at such a place, I went there, and found them. There it is impossible to deny that the reasoning is just, which says, that the credit of a witness may be tried by asking bim, whom did you receive the informetion from? where ; under what circumstances ? andif the man were bound te answer to those questions, and he had spoken falsely, with respect to the when and the where he had received it, er under what circumstances, if it rested upon his evidence, wher you had falsified it with respect te the preceding perticuJars, yow could not believe him. gs to the subsequent particalars, and the defendant must be acquitted. Nobody will deny but that it is a case, but it has become a settled rule, beeause private mischief gives way to lic convenience ; and it is an hardship which occursin particular cases, in consequence of the Necessities of public justice. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7297 To explain amyselt, witbowk making an professions respocting my own conduct, might fairly say, I ought to have my gown stripped off my back, if I, acting upon any thing but coaviction that I am right upon principle, and a principle that 3 cannot, in my situation, sacrifice—suppose the prisoner Now trymg, im the course of a transaction of thas kind, where the consequence of his being copwicted was notwhatitis in this sort of case, but that which, with respect to his pecuniary fortune, would ruin him over and over again, the abstract justice of the case is exactly the same; and yet it is quite clear that that direct question, who gave you information, in consequence of which you prosecute for those penalties which are to ruin the defendant? could not be asked. Then I ask this, whether, in common sense, and upon principle, the man who advises him to inform, is not substantially and really the inftormer—and whether the principle ot law, which has said that you cannot ask this question, because the consequence of asking the question will be, that those who may not have nerves so strong as nvy friend and. myself, who would not care aa farthing if our names were mentioned ; but great numbers of persons in the world would not choose to have their names mentioned on such occasions; and with respect to that feeling, call it fear, or imprudent reserve, n is a substantial principle in Jaw, that aman shall not have his name disclosed. I have thought it my duty thus to state the grounds of my objection. I have made it, ecause I am convinced the objection is right; when E state that, your lordship will easily believe, I do not mean to contend that it is right, because I am convinced it is right, but because I cannot, I think, discharge my duty to the public without stating my objection as I feel the objection; and in cases of this great weight and importance, and indeed in any case, I do not know how the attorney general of the country can proceed more safely than according to his own notions; they may be mistaken ones, but according to his own notions of what the rule of justice is. 
EYRE 7298 I, for my own part, adhere to my opinion. I think we must stand upon the principle, and that when we tun into very nice distinctions upon a principle, we get into difficulties from whence I never know how to disentangle myself, or to relieve my mind. The question is, whether, if it be opposed, any of the channels, by which this information and discovery comes to the officers of the crown, should be unecessarily disclosed? Isay unnecessarily, because it is no part of this fact at all whether this man did or did not mention this circumstance to this friend of his, or whether this friend of his gave him any particular advice. The only way in which it is permitted to be asked, is, because it may enable the defendant, by drawing out circumstances collateral to the fact, to establish a contradiction to the witness upon those collateral circumstances, and so to affect his credit. Now that would be true of every question that the wit of man could suggest; yet, undoubtedly, there are many questions which, even upon a crossexamination, a counsel is not permitted to ask. My apprehension is, that among those questions whch are not permitted to be asked, are all those questions which tend to the discovery of the channels by whom the disclosure was made to the officers of justice ; that it is upon the gencral principle of the convenience of public justice not to be disclosed ; that all persons in that situation are protected from the discovery; and that, if it is objected to, itis no more competent for the defendant to ask who the person was that advised him tomake 3 disclosure, than it is to whom he made the disclosure in consequence of that advice—than it is to ask any other question respecting the channel of communication, or all that was done underit. I never can distinguish, formy own part, the oases; if my brothers are satisfied there is sucha distinction, I shail be glad to submit to their opinion; but I think the principle extends to this case ; for, undoubtedly, an immediate answer to the question puts the person who gave this advice, into the situation desccibed by Mr. Attorney General, of being, in substance, the imformer to government of this transaction which this man discloses. I am of opinion, therefore. within the general rule upon this subject, the question ought not to be asked. 
EYRE 7299 Lord Chief Baron Macdonald —Iit seems you are agreed now with respect to this tact, namely, that the person, to whom the witness says he made the first disclosure, was neither a magistrate, nor any person concerned in the executive government of the country, and that from that person he received advice no longer to apply himself to him, because that was of no use, but that he should apply himself to some person, either in a magisterial character, or in some way concerned in the government of the country. There is no rule more sacred, undoubtedly, than that you ought not to ask any witness a question by which it should be disclosed to what magistrates or officer of the executive government he gave communication; and were I satisfied that the friend, to whom he disclosed this matter, was in any way a link in the communication, or a channel truly and substantially in the communication, I should certainly think that rule applied to him. On the other hand, it scems to me that upon a cross-examination it is material, when a person at a distance of time gives an account of transactions, to know whether it was then for the first time that he gave that account, or whether he gave that account recently after the transaction, or when he gave it, as that is a matter from whence important inferences may arise for the defendant. 
EYRE 7300 I think that that question should be asked, unless there should be a very great public inconvenience on the other side, which renders it much better for public justice in general, that the defendant should Josethe benefit of that question. In the particular instance it does appear to me, that a person not executing magistracy is in no situation to make it dangerous. A mere private peree simply saying,:do not come to me, but go to some person that can be of use, I think—as no possible disadvantage can arise in a case of that kind—it is a fair question to be asked, in order to ascertain huw a matter of this sort, alarming him, and attracting his attention, was or not revealed by him. I mean to draw the line distinctly in this way, that this person not being connected either with magistracy, or the executive government, it does not seem to me, in point of fact, to fall within the rule, which rule I hold sacred. 
HOTHAM 7301 The witness has said, he communicated this to his friend, under an impression and full persuasion that through him the intelligence which he gave was to he conveyed to a magistrate; that he has distinctly said. Now the question, as it seems to me, does turn upon the principles of public policy. I confess, for my own part, that upon those principles E cannot see any distinction between making a disclosure to the magistrate himself, or making it to any person who is to communicate that disclosure to the magisgrate; the principle is, that public justice demands, in many cases, that sort of secrecy, without which government could not be carried on. There are many cases, we all know, where it is of the last importance to us all, that such secrecy should be observed; and it is admitted on all hands, that if the communication is made to a magistrate, you shall not oblige the witness to disclose who that magistrate is; that is for the purpose of public justice to the country. Now here this man has communicated to his friend for the purpose, and under the persuasion of his going directly to a magistrate, being advised by him to do what he did. I cannot myself, I confess, distinguish the situation of that friend from the situation of a common informer, and we know very well that it would not be Permintat to ask that question of him—here I consider this (I am sorry to differ from my lord chief baron) as a link of the same chain; I do consider that it makes no sort of difference whether the intelligence is directly conveyed to the magistrate, or by more indirect means; the purpose for whieh it is disclosed to this man is, that of being conveyed to the magistrate; and I think upon principle that public justice would be defeated if such a thing was allowed. 
GROSE 7303 In this casc, it seems to me, that we all agree about the principle, the question is, who is right in the application of that principle; for we do most perfectly agree in this principle, that the name of the informer is not to be disclosed : that isthe law stated; that is the law agreed and argued upon by the counsel on both sides. Then the question in this case is, whether this persun, whose name is asked, ig to he considered as the informer. Now the evidence is this; I consulted witha friend, who advised me what to do, and to make a teport. I did so, and I have done it from time to time. Then in consequence of whose advice is it that this isdone? In consequence of this man’s advice, whose name is now asked. If it is in consequence of his advice, I must confess it does seem to me that, essentially and substantially, and according to every idea of good sense, he must be considered to be the informer: But it is very true that, perhaps in the course of this investigation, the name of some other person may be inquired, whose name it may not be competent to ask, and the reason may be this, that in the course of this business there may be more informers. than one, aad ine yume rinciple that applies to one, will a of Lely to the cthlerss and when I find bat the evidence is, that this man advised the witness what to do, I must confess that the witness having acted in consequence of that advice, he seems to me tu be as essentially a pe I nm the informer as any one person can be in-thie case, because if it had not been for his advice, non constat, that this would have been done, I therefore, however unwilling I am, and [aps always exceedingly unwilling in a case where life is at stake to shut the door of evidence, yet where a point of great constitutional law, that which is to affect the public justice of the kingdom is in question, I must decide upon it as my conviction tells me is right, at the same time lamenting that there should be such a difference in the Court as there is now, because I am very willing to confess, that it has not been the habit of my prace tice, never having sat in that court, where those questions most frequently arise, to decide upon those questions; but however the little ability I have I must employ upon the subject; and taking the rule and the principle to be that the name of the informer is not to be disclosed, I can only look to whether this person, whose name is referred to, is the informer or not; he appearing to be essentially the informer, I think, according to the tule of law, the question ought not to be put. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7333 You will attend to what the gentleman says
EYRE 7359 You are asked a simple question; did you yourself go to any magistrate 
EYRE 7361 I wish you would not overpower the counsel or me with words. You are asked a simple question, whether you did, or not, go to a magistrate 
EYRE 7368 He never said that his friend advised him to a particular person ; if he did I have mistaken him. 
EYRE 7374 Certainly not. 
EYRE 7396 lIt is always usual, and very reasonable it is, when a witness speaks from memorandums, that the counsel should have an epee nity of looking at those memorandums, when he is cross-examining that witness. If there is any thing that you say, upon your oath, does not relate to that subject, but some other subject, to be sure it is impossible that it could be asked, that that should be seen; how to arrange that in a very long evidence, like this, is among the difficulties of so ex i a case as this is; we must struggle with it as well as we can; whenever you are at’ leisure to go through the subject with him, if he holds bis yarers in his hands, you can ask him, as to is minutes, if they could be separated by pasting over, or if, with safety, by obliterating those parts. 
EYRE 7398 I could. 
EYRE 7399 Have you any objection, Mr. Erskine, to his obliterating his other memorandums with ink, you a of him, upon oath, whether he has obli any of those articles to which he spoke, when he gave evidence? 
EYRE 7401 In a common case, it is the usual course, for the ceunsel to take the memorandums in-his hand, for the cross-examination, but, in this case, I do not see how it is possible to do this ; this is a history, an im tt and material history, to be sure, of the different branches of this society as it is formed into divisions, aime by commission of delegates for the whole; it has so happened, that here are the transactions both of the divisions, and of the delegates, that are now laid before the jury ; of courseit must run into great length; I cannot say into more length than its importance requires ; we are ready to do all that we can to assist yes, consistently with not obliging him to discover what does not relate to this cause. 
EYRE 7403 I will swear that. ‘ 
EYRE 7405 Yes. 
EYRE 7406 I understood him to say, that he did, in fact, make his reports from these minutes; if he did not make his report to the division from theseminutes, he must have had another set of notes, for he must have made some, from the nature of the thing; for they were to report to the division every thing that passed among the delegates, that did not come under the head of secrecy, on the next day of holding that division mecting ; therefore it must be from some materials; consequently, if he has dealt fairly with us, these are the minutes. 
EYRE 7408 I should, if I were in his case, put the book into your hand, without any difficulty, stating the parts that do not relate to this cause; then he will take his minutes, and obliterate those parts that do not relate to this cause against tomorrow morning. 
EYRE 7409 Mr. Maclean called again. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7410 Did you find that paper any where? — Yes; I found it in the house of Mr. Adams. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7411 Extract of a Letter, dated Sheffield, 18th of October, 1792, signed, “ The Editor of the Patriot, addressed to Mr. Andrews, secretary to the Society of the Friends of Universal Peace, and the Rights of Man, at Stockport. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7412 “It only remains then for us, secing the great and innumerable difficulties we have to encounter, to cast about for the most likely and proper means and weapons by which to detend ourselves, and to forward and support such measures as it may be necessary to pursue; and on this head, my good sir, permit me to impress it on the minds of your society, that reason, imperial reason, must ever be our eneralissimo, or commander in chief; when Tay this, I beg leave to add, that art must be second in command ; by the word ‘ art,’ I do not mean craft or cunning, but that mode of application of our reason and arguments on different men, and on different occasions, which only a considerable degree of study, and practical knowledge also, of men and manners, can ever furnish us with, so as to make us proficients. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7413 “ Allow me then to observe to you, sir, that 1 perfectly coincide with you in opinion, with regard to the different societies appointing delegates to go into the different villages, and country places, for the purpose of informing their minds, and rousing them from the lethargy in which they seem plunged. I have already communicated the same idea to the London Constitutional and Corresponding Societies, and to those of Norwich and Manchester, and I hope it will soon be universally adopted by every one. But the grand object to. be attended to, on this head, is the chdice of men to be appointed; a neglect of this kind had iike to have had very awkward consequences in this neighbourhood, and, if not immediately checked, would have injured the cause of freedom very greatly; infinite care and circumspection will therefore be necessary on this head. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7414 “As I am on the subject, permit me to suggest to those members of your society, who may undertake this arduous, but honourable and praise-worthy task, that they cannot be too cautious in their mode of ceeding. The minds of men, for the wisest and best purposes, are formed by the great Creator as various and unlike each other as their faces, and their passions reign over each with the same uncertain and variegated swmyself and in the same manner that sir Robert Walpole (one of the elders and fathers of corruption) very justly observed, that every man has his price in the way of being hought; so we may fairly apply the same maxim to mankind in general, in the article of persuasion, and the dextrous method of bringing them from wrong opinions they may have formed, or prejudices they may have imbibed, by anattentive observation of their mtellectual faculties, and that leading passion of the sout which governs the main spring of their most material actions. For example, the generality of farmers in this county and Lancashire, are as ignorant as the brutes they ride to market, and so absorbed in the sordid idea of getting, that, provided they can keep up the prices of rain, cattle, &c. so as to answer their landlords, and pay their taxes, however enormous, they are too sluggish and indolent to thmk about reforms, or any thing of the kind, yet there is one string about their hearts, which, being skilfully touched, will make them dance to any time, and move to any measwre, This is the subject of tythes ; why does it touch them? Why sir? Because it is within the scope of their limited capacity. Ignorant as they are in other matters, they see and pungently feel the weight of this baneful and unjust devourer of all their improvements in agriculture and husbandry ; and I believe, did every tax operate in the same visible degree which this imposition does, I fear there would be an end to the idea of taxation being submitted to at all. Indeed, as taxes are laid on, at present, by those who do not represent us, the taxation is neither more nor less than a robbery; a submission to it, slavery. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7415 “But to return to my subject. In the same manner that a farmer may be roused by the mention of tythes, the shoe-makers may by the excessive dearness of leather, the innkeeper by the numerous and unnecessary standing army, and all by a temperate and dispassionate relation of the immense number of sinecure places, and useless offices, in which the corrupt and prostitute favourites, agents, and dependants of the rich and great, riot in the spoils and plunder wrested from the sweat of the brow, and continual labour of the body of the husbandman, the mechanic, the labourer, and the artificer. It is by no means a difficult matter to raise general indignation at the idea of so small a comparative number of useless, idle, and profligate drones, sucking and squandering away the honey potincd by such immense numbers of hard-toiling and industrious bees. If you (for I am certain you will be one of the most active of these-delegates) meet with men who have violent prejudices in favour of any abuse or party, never attack those prejudices directly, for that will only inflame and confirm them the more; pass them over fur the present, and engage their attention towards something else, in which they will listen with a less degrce of apprehension of being attacked in a favourite point; once gain their good apinion, and open their eyes to one evil, they will be more ready to hear you on others; till, at last, the favourite object by which their cyes were jaundiced, will appear in its true colours, and fall before your arguinents like all the rest. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7416 “ There is one thing above all others which requires to be particularly attended to, and that is, to endeavour to undcceive the mass -of people, with respect to those falsehoods which have been industriously propagated by the enemies to a reform, in order to blind, delude, and terrify all ranks of people: who are any way independent, or possessed of Property: One of these falschoods is, “ that the advocates of reform wish to introduce a “levelling scheme, or an equal partition of property,’ This alarms the farmers, and indeed all classes of men, who, by their industry, or other adventitious circumstances, are possessed of the goods of this world. So many vile ministerial prints as have propagated this doctrine, aided and assisted by the private representations, or rather misrepresentations, of the clergy, and other tools of overnment, and of privileged orders, have da very wonderful and baneful effect on the multitude, and have stamped a dread of reform on the minds of many that I know, whose situations in life would induce one reasonably to suppose it impossible, so completely to impose upon them; however, it always has been the case, that falsehoods, boldly uttered, may prevail for a time, but must be overwhelmed, in the end, by the bright and sacred energies of truth. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7417 o explain this matter, and many others properly, will require great coolncss, moderation, and patience. I have found the tollowing method answer best: ‘ Do you know “such a gentleman?’ naming sume one of large property and good character in the neighbourhood, who is known to be a friend to a reform; ‘ Yes.’—‘ Well, and do you suppose that he would promote a scheme that would occasion and oblige him to part with property he possesses, in order for it to be di
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7418 ‘ vided amongst strangers whom he never saw or heard of ?’ ‘No’—“ Why then should you suffer yourself to be imposed on by such aa idle tale fabricated and calculated for the purpose of raising a dread in you against “those more enlightened of your fellow-citi“zens who wish for a reform, as yeu would, “did you see its necessity; a dread which “may cause you to shut your eyes upon op‘ pressive excise and game-laws, exorbitant tythes, an unnecessary standing army, kept on foot at the expense of two millions and a half, for the purposes of influence and cor‘ruption; .a pension-list, which is a disgrace to the government, and a stigma and re‘proach on the spirit and prudence of the “nation ; sinecure places, for the mere pos“sessing of which, hundreds of individuals receive thousands a year each, for duing nothing at all, either for the public service or their own; in short, such an enormous accumulation of taxes, and so prodigal an expenditure of their produce, as no nation on the earth ever heard of or submitted to before. To make you shut your eves, and continue blind to these enormities, those idle and futile tales are villanously dispersed “abroad ; but believe them not, consult your own reason, and it will show you that there is a palpable lie on the face of every one of them?’ Then explain the nature, aim, and end of your society, mvite them to attend it, and to judge for themselves: If they do so, they will soon aid and assist you, by adopting similar ones in their several neighbourhoods, till, in time, they will overspread the whole surface of this sca-girt isle. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7419 “ At present, sir, I will not trouble you further on the subject, which 1 now quit tw return to the conduct and regulatian of your own society, and all others which may arise hereafter; and as to them, I think the inakeepers in Stockport, Manchester, &c. have given you a hint and lesson, for which you ouglit to esteem yourselves for ever obliged to them. I own their insolence and audacity in proceeding as they have done, is beyond example, but only deserying of contempt; as such, leave them to themselves ; public-houses were never worthy of receiving such guests, whose sacred and important duty require and demand to be performed in mansions more dignified and respectable; your meetings should be at the houses of one -another in honourable rotatien ; and, to pree. vent inconvenience frum too great a number, not more than ten or twelve at the most should compose a primary or district meeting; more members may be admitted in each district, till they reach twenty or twenty-four according to the number fixed on—but thea immediately should divide into two district: meetings; the several districts should send each one member, by election, to a meeting of delegates, and this meeting of delegates should elect out of their own body a certain nuigber, which is to compose 3 select com: 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7420 mittee ; this select committee to manage the correspondence, and every other important concern for the whole of the districts in any town or parish, subject always to the revision and approbation of the districts; the delegates and select committee to be chosen only for a limited time, before the expiration of which, others to be elected as betore, from the districts, to supply their places, by which rotations every member would in time become qualified to be a delegate and a select commnittce-man, though he might not be soon his first entrance as a district member. These are only hints on which you may improve or enlarge as much as you please. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7421 We will now read a draft of an answer to this letter, which was found likewise in the possession of Mr. Adams; it has nodate; it has two handwritings init; I may, perhaps, trouble your lordships, in the course of this cause, with evidence to prove whose hand-writings they are, but that is not necessary to enable me to read it; 1 wish todraw your lordships attention particularly to the two last paragraphs. 
EYRE 7426 Freedom, though an infant, makes herculean efforts ; and the vipers, aristocracy and monarchy, are panting and writhing under its grasp. May success, peace, and hap- piness attend those efforts. “ Permit us to add, that ‘the Society for Constitutional Information will gladly receive or communicate intelligences, and for that purpose be happy to correspond ‘either with other socicties or with individuals, that makethe great and common cause of an equal and real representation of the people in parlia-‘ ment, and the other grand objects of freedom, ; their end.

GARROW 7832 This letter was transmitted by the witness to Miller, at Perth, and he says he sent other copies to different places in the country, particularly to Strathaven ; your lordships recols lect that an answer to that sent to Strathaven, has been read. 
GARROW 7833 “ Citizens, The critical moment is arrived, and Britons must either assert with zeal and firmness their claims to liberty, or yield without resistance to the chains that ministerial usurpation is forging for them. Will you coOperate with us, in the only peaceable measure that now presents itself with any prospect of success? We need not intimate to you, that notwithstanding the unparalleled audacity of a corrupt and overbearing faction, which at present tramples on the rights and liberties of the people, our meetings cannot in England be interrupted, without the previous adoption of a convention bill—a measure it is our duty to anticipate, that the ties of union may be more firmly drawn, and the sentiments and views of the different societies throughout the nation be compared, while it is yet In our power, so as to guide and direct the future operations of the friends of freedom. Rouse then, to one exertion more ! and let us show our consciousness of this important truth, “Ifwe are to be beaten down with threats, prosecutions, and illegal sentences, we are unworthy, we are incapable of liberty..—We must, however, be expeditious. Hessians and Austrians are already among us; and if wc tamely submit, a cloud of these armed barbarians may shortly be poured in upon us. Let us form then another British Convention; we have a central situation in our view, which, we believe, would be most convenient for the whole island ; but which we forbear to mention (entreating your confidence in this particular) till we have the answer of the societics any ofthe members, tending that way

GARROW 7942 It would not have occurred to me to ask you, whether you were a traitor, or your associates declared themselves to be so.—Now I will put some questions to you, upon what you have been asked. You have told that gentleman that you had no idea of assuming the powers of legislation by force 
GARROW 7944 You meant merely to procure, or obtain, if you could, a reform in the representation of the people 
GARROW 7946 And that by peaceable means 
GARROW 7948 And that you would have shuddered at an idea of force, or resistance to the civil power of the country ; dol take you right
GARROW 7950 You had no idea of going farther than a fair, peaceable, and orderly application for a redress of that which you conceived to be wrong 
GARROW 7952 Were you present when that convention came to this resolution ? and then the proper constitutional judges will say, whether you meant it or not : 
GARROW 7953 hat this convention, considering the calamitous consequences of any act of the legislature which may tend to deprive the whole, or any part of the people, of their undoubted right to meet, either by themselves, or by delegation, to discuss any matter relative to their common interest, whether of a public or private nature, and holding the same to be totally inconsistent with the first principles and safety of society, and also subversive of our known and acknowledged constitutional liberties, do hereby declare, before God and the world, that we shall follow the wholesome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which shall militate against the constitution of our country, and shall continue to assemble and consider of the best means by which we can accomplish a real representation of the people, and annual election, until compelled to desist by superior force.’—Did you know that the convention, of which you were a member, ‘who sought all those things by peaceful and orderly means, had come to that resolution 
GARROW 7955 Upon your oath, were not you present when it was proposed
GARROW 7957 Will you swear you were not present 
GARROW 7959 Can you say you were not present when such a resolution was passed
GARROW 7961 Attend to this “ The convention doth hereby resolve, that each delegate, immediately on his return home, do convene his constituents, and explain to them the necessity of Beene a delegate, or deletes, and of establishing a fund, without lelay, against any of these emergencies, for his or their expense; and that they do instruct the said delegate or delegates, to hold themselves ready to depart at one hour's warning.

I did not expect we should get right in a moment; let us keep as much witbin bounds as we can; it disturbs the argument of the examination entirely, when it is so filled with these observations.

GARROW 7980 That gentleman has asked you, what you were to do when you should be got together upon the summons of the delegates. Do you mean to state, upon your oath, that you had the least apprehen- , 
GARROW 7981 sion that that meeting, in a Convention of Emergency, summoned by a secret committee of emergency, was for the purpose of again petitioning parliament 
GARROW 7983 Do you mean to state, upon your oath, that ou understood that the resolution which I ve read to you, and which I will read again —“ That we shall follow the wholesome examp!c of former times, by paying no regard to any act which shall militate against the constitution of our country, and shall continue to assemble and consider of the best means by which we can accomplish a real representation of the people, and annual election, until compelled to desist by superior force. — Do you mean to swear that you understood that to be to meet in such convention for the pas of again petitioning parliament
GARROW 7985 Do you mean to state, that you understood that to be the meaning of such a meeting in a Convention of Emergency
GARROW 7987 That the delegates were to hold themselves in readiness to depart at an hour’s warning, for the purpose of again petitioning that parliament, which they had already petitioned without success ? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 7989 It has been distinctly proved in evidence, that these Scotch societies had stated that more effectual means should be used. 
EYRE 7991 It is not a subject to be debated, but it is perfectly clear that just in the manner in which the question was put, the fact was not stated. 
GARROW 7992 Do you mean to represent to the Court and the Jury, that you understood that the delegates were to hold themselves in readiness to assemble upon an hour’s Notice, in order to petition parliament upon the dispersion of the convention 
GARROW 7994 Do you mean again to state that you un derstood the purpose of that second convention, after the dispersion of the first, was to petition parliament
GARROW 7996 Let me see whether I understand you distinctly, for God forbid E should misunderstand you, or endeavour to misrepresent you—You 
GARROW 7997 ‘ understood that the convention of emergency, which was to be collected by the committee of emergency upon an hour's notice, was tr petition parliament 
GARROW 7999 For what purpose, after the dispersion of the existing convention, was a new convention of emergency to be called by a committee of emergency, to petition parliament, as you understood it 
GARROW 8001 So that though the first petition should be rejected, and the convention dispersed by force, yet you understood there was to bea committee of emergency. to call a new convention of emergency, and so & on i petitioning, though they should have ther petitions again rejected (—I understood that the Friends of the People meant to petition parliament till they should gain their end. 
GARROW 8002 Then why did not the society of the Friends of the People go on petitioning perliament, without sending delegates to a British Convention for the purpose of effecting these reforms 
GARROW 8004 And likewise what
GARROW 8006 Where is your place of residence 
GARROW 8008 Did you attend the meetings of that convention 
GARROW 8010 Were there any committees for the purpose of managing the business of this convention 
GARROW 8012 Are you now sworn according to the manmer in which you usually take an oath
GARROW 8014 You were a delegate of the British Convention assembled at Edinburgh 
GARROW 8016 Were there any committees of the convention for the purpose of managing its business 
GARROW 8018 Did they from time to time report to the convention itself
GARROW 8020 Do you remember the circumstance of the convention being dispersed by the magistrates 
GARROW 8022 After the convention was dispersed, do you semember any committec being formed out of the societies 
GARROW 8024 What was the name of it
GARROW 8026 Of what persons was that Committee of Union composed 
GARROW 8028 Was it composed of members of the convention which had bcen dispersed 
GARROW 8030 Were those who, as far as you know, were not members of the former convention, members of the Society of the Friends of the People at Edinburgh 
GARROW 8032 Was there any other committee, called a Committee of Ways and Means 
GARROW 8034 Ieans; but who made it out in that form I know not. 
GARROW 8035 Of that committee which was called the Committee of Ways and Means, who were the members
GARROW 8037 Do you remember Watt, as a member of that Committee of Ways and Means, reading any plan for the purpose of effecting some mischief at Edinburgh 
GARROW 8039 You had been a member of the British Convention
GARROW 8041 What was the plan which was read in she Committee of Ways and Means by Mr. Watt, one of the delegates, and who was a member of that committee 
GARROW 8043 Attend to me a single moment—do you know for what purpose, in particular, you were assembled at the time that this plan was 
GARROW 8044 — ee rend—was it for answering any letter 
GARROW 8046 Ia that Committee of Ways and Means, was there any letter which had come to the society, or any of its members, which pure ported to be a circular letter which you were then met to answer? Leok athis letter, was this letter produced in the Committee of. Ways and Mecans
GARROW 8048 At a Committee of Ways and Means, Watt read a plan
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8051 It is due from me to state to your lordships how I shape the case. We have now, as your lordships recollect, proved by a letter on the 17th of May, 1793, from Mr. Hardy, by a Mr. Urquhart, who was then going to Ediaburgh, that he sent this proposition to the Convention a Edinburgh, to associate not only that society with the London Corresponding Seciety, but both with every other society throughout the nation—that in answer to that, Mr. Skirving, who appears to be the secretary, in a lettor which was found in the possession of the prisoner states—“ If either you in England, or we in Scotland, should ateempt separately the reform which we seek to obtain, we should, by so doing, only expose our weakness, and manifest our ignorance of the corruption which opposes our important undertaking
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8053 Be 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8054 Teast to be ready to associate
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8056 Your lordships will give me leave to put you in mind also, that this society wrote to Sheffield, to Leeds, and'I think to one or two other places, to send delegates to the convention in Scotland; they did send delegates to the convention in Scotland; and: Skirving, whose name has before occurred, aj pears to have written circular letters upon the arrival of the delegates of the two English societies, desiring all the societies to come 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8057 Your lordships likewise recollect, that we have given in evidence, letters that were written by Hardy, and also by peeet and Gerrald, who were delegates in Scotland ; and likewise letters written from those delegates to Hardy, whilst the convention was sitting. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8058 Hardy, in a letter of the 8th of November, 1793, says—“ That part of your letter which mentioned your visiting different towns in Scotland, for the purpose of promoting the cause; they were pleased with the idea, bat they thought that it could not be put in prac tice, on account of the necessary supplies, which come in but slowly
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8060 Your lordships will also be pleased to recollect that, on the 8th of December, 1793, Mar. garot, who was then in Scotland, writes to the secretary of the London Corresponding Society, a letter—There is also a letter of the 22d of December, 1793, in which M: writes them, to come to very strong resol tions
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8062 Then upon the 20th of January, 1794, your lordship will also recollect, that at the Globe: tavern they came to precisely the same resolution, as that which was come to in the convention in Scotland, before that conven tion was dispersed
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8064 After the dispersion of the convention, these societies no longer existed as a convention; but the Friends of the People, and other affiliated societiesin Scotland, proceeded to form committees of Ways and Means, and Union: —I have therefore, I submit, clearly laid a foundation to show that up to this period, all those societies were affiliated, that is the London and Scotch Societies; and that it is exceedingly clear, whatever convention was to called, was to be a convention bath of the people of England and Scotland. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8065 his being so we have-also laid before your lordships evidence, of which I will say this only, that it is evidence to go to the jury, that the aftiiated societies in London, many of the members ot them were providing themselves with muskets and pikes; that the Sheffield society, which corresponded as well with Scotland as with London, was also providing pikes :, then I conceive that I am at liberty to proveasatactin thiscase, the providing of pikes, agd the actual existence of nina of resistance to the government in Scotland at the same time, precisely upon the same principle as if we were now trying what would be a much more manifest overt act, I mean an open rebellion in the country—I conceive, upon the principle laid down in lord Lovat’s, and other cases, that there could not be a particle of doubt, that if I had charged an open act of rebellion in England, that I should have been entitled to show that in fact there was in Scotland, another armed force resisting the king's forces there; even though I did not show any communication by letter between them, so as to make it probable that they were co-operating with each other. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8066 ‘I submit to your lordships, that this is evidence to go before the jury, leaving them to judge of the application that it has. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8069 In otder that I may state the thing entirely to the Court, I beg to put the Court in mind that we have ew proved that a circular letter which was zo call this convention, has been actually found in Scotland, and that that isa circular letter, which is written after resolutions which state that they are to have a convention of the people. ‘ 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8071 Yes. 
EYRE 8081 Did he say who the people were that were to execute this
GARROW 8083 This plan of Watt’s, I understand you, was read at a meeting of the committee 
GARROW 8085 How many members of the grand committee might be present when Watt read his first plan
GARROW 8087 So that there were five out of those seven present
GARROW 8089 When Watt read this paper, what passed upon it in the committee 
GARROW 8091 Upon his proposing the second’ phan, when that paper, there was no farther commentpassed about it
GARROW 8093 When

GARROW 8099 What was the plan proposed by Watt at that sub-committee meeting 
GARROW 8101 ar hay, to remove the same from their respective places of abode, under pain of death. 
EYRE 8102 Were you present at that meeting too
EYRE 8104 How soon was shat after the first
EYRE 8106 think I was only five nights at that committee altegether. 
EYRE 8107 Was it the next night after, or later
EYRE 8109 Was there any thing in that address relative to his majesty 
EYRE 8111 For what purpose 
EYRE 8113 When was this proclamation, according to Watt’s representation, in that committee, to be carried into execution
EYRE 8115 Was the attack that you describe, the drawing the soldiers from the Castle, &c.
EYRE 8117 Was it explained by him, in the committee, what was to be done with those soldiers when they should he so surrounded 
EYRE 8119 Had you been a member of the British Convention at Edinburgh
EYRE 8121 Were you present at the passing of any of their solemn resolutions 
EYRE 8123 Do you know a person of the name of Orrock 
EYRE 8125 Do you know of any order he received from Watt to form any offensive instruments of any sort
EYRE 8127 ‘model, upon the table, or something. 
EYRE 8128 What trade is Orrock 
EYRE 8130 Did he reside in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh 
EYRE 8132 Do you know that, in point of fact, Orrock did make some pikes for Watt, in consequent of that order
EYRE 8134 Do you know of any having been found in Watt's or Orrock’s houses 
EYRE 8136 You mentioned a person of the name of Stock, who was present at this last meeting st which you and Watt were present 
EYRE 8138 Did Mr. Stock, at that time, mention any lace to which he was going
EYRE 8140 Did. he mention any person in London is particular upon whom he intended to wait, ia order to establish'a mode of correspondence with Mr. Watt
EYRE 8142 For what purpose: wae he to wait upon Mr. Hardy 
EYRE 8144 Do you remember Stock writing any thing then, as a plan of correspondence himself and any other person 
EYRE 8146 What was that paper represented to —Watt wished a correspondence betweet Hardy and him ; he- mentioned that he wish ed:to corfspond ina safe metited; and: he gave him this as a plan how he might corres- a plan, and point it out to the attention of the pond ie safety; that was the plan he mentioned. 
EYRE 8147 Was any thing said at that meeting of Stock’s calling aguin upon Watt on the subject of his going to London 
EYRE 8149 Did you see any thing more of Stock 
EYRE 8184 Had there been any notice given of such a motion 
EYRE 8188 Do not you com found that with an Address to the Nation 
GARROW 8223 What was the Committee of Union for
GARROW 8225 Oh! then a sub-committee formed out of the Committee of Union 
GARROW 8227 Do you mean to represent that the purpose of the committee of Union, as well as that of Ways and Means, was only relative to Skirving’s letter about his own finances.—I ask you was it not for the purpose of establishing a fund far a new convention 
GARROW 8229 You can give no account what the Committee of Union was for
GARROW 8231 You would not have gone into the convention, if you had had an idea of employing an force, or touching the king’s majesty, or at all encroaching upon the constitution, or producing in short a reform, but by peaceable means
GARROW 8233 Did you know that your convention had resolved : “ That this convention, considering the calamitous consequences of any act of the Icgislature, which may tend to deprive the whole, or any part of the peole of their undoubted right to meet, either yy themselves, or by delegation, to discuss any matter relative to their common snr whether of a public or private nature; ani holding the same tobe totally inconsistent with the first principles and safety of society ; and also subversive of our known and acknowledged constitutional liberties ; — do hereby declare, before God and the world, that we shall follow the wholesome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which shall militate against the constitution of our country; and shall continue to assemble and consider of the best means by which we can accomplish a real representation of the people, and annual election ; until compelled to desist by seperr force 
GARROW 8235 Do not you know that with reat solemnity the convention had come to that resolution
GARROW 8237 Did you not know that the convention had resolved, that in certain emergencies, they should declare their sittings permanent 
GARROW 8239 Nor that it should be constituted, and proceed to business, as svon as twenty-one should be met 
GARROW 8241 Did you not know that the convention resolved that the delegates were to hold themselves ready to depart at an hour's warning, and to repair to the place of mecting appointed by the committee of emergency.— Did you
GARROW 8243 You have heard the delegates were to meet at an hour's notice 
GARROW 8245 That iivey were to be furnished with information 
GARROW 8247 Who was to furnish them with it
GARROW 8249 Upon your oath, do not you know it was to be a convention of emergency 
GARROW 8251 The purpose of this new convention. I take it for granted, was only to petition parliament for a reform 
EYRE 8253 You are asking this man to go the length of convicting himself of high treason
GARROW 8255 It has been examined to on the other side. 
EYRE 8256 It is difficult to say that a question should be asked on one side, which should not be controverted by examination on the other side; witnesses therefore should understand to what they sube ject themselves. 
EYRE 8257 M Eo:an
GARROW 8259 Did you search the house of Watt, who was executed at Edinburgh
GARROW 8261 Did you find any pikes in his house 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8264 It has now been spoken of, that Watt gave orders for pikes— we shall be able to prove by the time at which the orders were given, that it was before Hardy was apprehended. 
EYRE 8265 That cannot be admitted. 
EYRE 8266 The Court was about to adjourn.] 
EYRE 8269 I feel the weight of your observations, of the difficulty under which you labour, in an extraordinary case, which can hardly be judged of by the common rules on which we proceed in cases of this nature; the Court are of a disposition to give you all the indulgence they Repsihly can, because there is a vast mass of evidence; the case arises out of the evidence, and it is fit the case should be thoroughly canvassed
EYRE 8271 Now I will tell you very fairly, if the question were only the personal accommodation of yourself and Mr. Gibbs, at the expense of the personal convenience of myself, my lord, and my brothers, I am quite sure we should have no difficulty in the sacrifice of our personal convenience; but there is a great deal more in the case,—we have a jury who have been thrown into the most arduous service that ever I sawa jury engagedin: they have borne it in a manner that does them infinite honour, and I have no doubt but that as far as it is necessary that they should continue in the situation they are in, that they will bear it chearfully
EYRE 8273 ou may go on with the case as far as it will e necessary for you to go on, to fillup all the time that ought to be filled up, leaving only a part of Sunday, the common interval of rest, without our keeping the jury in a situation to do nothing
EYRE 8276 I dread the explanation ofa few hours; Mr. Attorney Gesere what farther evidence have you to pro
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8277 I think my evidence will not take up more than forty minutes, 
EYRE 8279 tI shall sit late on Saturday night ; I say ing of Sunday. 
EYRE 8281 i can casily think that to be the case, and it is a circumstanceIam extremely sorry for; on the other hand, I cannot hazard the situation of the jury. 
EYRE 8284 What is it you ask for? 
EYRE 8286 Wehave offcred you an expedient; neither of you say to us whether you can accept it, 
EYRE 8288 That it may not be in your judgment a desirable thing is very well, but that there is any other objection to it, I cannot agree to. Whether the case is taken upon the summing up of the evidence, or whether it is taken upon the opening of the evidence, is as to all legal purpose the same; I can see no difference: it may make a vast difference in your judgmeut, as to whet is the best manner and the best method of laying your case before the jury ; undoubtedly we are assisting the prisoner by putting the counsel in a situation to do his business in the best manner, by proposing it thus; whereas if they were put u Going it in the ordi course, they would lie under a peculiar di culty and disadvantage. Mr. Erskine has act yet told us what he asks. 
EYRE 8290 Then suppose we adjoura to eleven o'clock. 
EYRE 8292 You will conduet your case in the manner you think best for the interest of your client. 
EYRE 8294 I feel so much for the situation of the jury, that on their account I cannot think of it. 
EYRE 8297 As the jury ask it for you, I will not refuse you. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8298 I am now going to call a witness to prove that a paper was found in the possession of Mr. Thelwall, and also to prove that another paper of the same sort was found in the possession of Mr. Martin, being of the hand-writing of Martin. These papers were found after the apprehension of Mr. Hardy. When I have proved that the papers were found in the possession of Martin and of Thelwall, I shall then go on to prove by a witness or two, whom t shall call for that purpose, that they existed in the possession of each of them long before the apprehension of Mr. Hardy: they purport upon the face of them to be iagered for the general meetin; of the Corresponding Society, upon the 14¢! of April, 1794, at Chalk Farm. 
EYRE 8300 The only ground upon which any paper is objected to as evidence, found after the apprehension of the party, is Sot by possibility the paper might Dot have existed, or might not have been in the hands of the person till after his apprehension ; that is the only gecanil upon which the evidence is refused; if they remove that ground of objection, it is admissible. 
EYRE 8302 That goes rather to the effect of the evidence, than to the admissibility; it being found in the possession of the parties before the apprehension, removes in fact the objection. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8303 Mr. Martin and Mr. Thelwall, in whose custody the papers were found, were persons who, together with Mr. Hardy, were appointed to prepare the proceedings for the Chalk Farm meeting. 
EYRE 8304 I observed that that goes more to the effect of the evidence, than, to its admissibility. ‘ 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8305 Where did you find that paper 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8308 [showing it to the witness. ]—I found this in Mr. Martin's chest in the King’s-beneh prison. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8310 On the 29th of May. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8311 Look at that paper do you know whose hand-writing that is 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8313 Have you seen him write 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8315 Whose hand-writing do you believe that to be
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8321 You were confined in the King’s-benth prison, I believe, fur debt 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8323 How long ago
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8325 How long had you been there 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8327 Was hea prisoner there 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8329 Do you remember, while you were in the King’s Bench, ever secing either of the papers now put into your hand 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8331 When was it that you saw them 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8333 Look at the top of this paper, and tell me whether it was before the date there mentioned, or not
EYRE 8335 Where did you see them 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8337 Had you any conversation with Martin at that time 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8339 Look at the other paper, and tell my lord and the jury whether those are the papers which he read several times in the room, or not
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8341 Did you know Pearce 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8343 Did he use to come there
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8347 Was Mrs. Evans, your wife, with you
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8349 Was Mr. Tourll present at that time 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8351 Did theyseethese papers as well as you
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8353 Did they hear the declarations of Martin, you have stated them, as well as you
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8367 Was there a man of the name of Gay in the King’s bench prison at the time that Martin was there 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8369 At the end of Martin’s letter he mentions Gay. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8370 You are the wife of the gentleman who gave evidence just now 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8372 You attended your husband, I believe, in the King’s-bench prison
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8374 Did you ever see these papers before, look at them ? [showing them to the witness.
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8376 Where may you have seen them 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8378 In whose room or possession
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8380 When was it that you saw them there ; was it before or after the month stated at the top
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8382 Did you happen to hear Mr. Martin say any thing respecting these papers; and if he said any thing, what was it that he did say 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8384 Did you hear him say any thing else, except what he said about the paper 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8386 Was there any talk about Chalk-farrn
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8388 Did he say any thing else
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8390 Do you remember a person of the name of Pearce coming there 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8392 Had Martin and Pearce any conversation about these papers, or Chalk-farm 
EYRE 8395 I do not know that it is, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8398 Do you know what street that is in
EYRE 8413 I did not understand them to be the originals, or copies of the resolutions read at Chalk-farm, but that Martin said, at the time they saw these papers, that he had prepared the resolutions x Chalk-farm, and that the paper brought by Pearce was a printed copy of those resolutions; unless this shall turn out to be the original of the resolutions, it amounts to nothing. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8415 I believe you had the misfortune to be in the King’s-bench poss about the months of 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8416 March and April Jast —Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8417 Da you know Mr. John Martin at all 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8419 know him by frequently seeing him in Mr. Evans’s room; I never knew him before he came there. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8420 That is the husband of the lady who was here just now 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8422 Did you ever see this paper before? —No. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8423 Did you hear Martin say any thing about the Chalk-farm meeting
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8425 Be so good as state what you heard him say 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8427 What month was that in
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8429 State what Mr. Martin said in your hearing, about the Chalk-farm business 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8431 Was there aman of the name of Gay in prison at that time 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8433 Were he and Martin much together 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8435 t will readpresently a-rcsolution of the Constitutional Society, relative to that Mr. Gay; his name occurs in that letter, and I think he appears to be proposed as a member to that societ; by Mr. Tooke. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8436 Did you see Pearce there 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8438 Perhaps you had not occasion to observe any particular communication between them
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8440 Now LI take it there is no objection to reading the paper; therefore I desire it may be read, and I would beg of your lordships and the jury, not only to attend to what is left in the paper, but to what is struck out of it to look at the paper itself. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8441 “ At a general Meeting of the London Corresponding Society, held at — on Monday, the 14th day of April, 1794. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8442 “ Citizen in the chair. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8443 “ Resolved, That all meee ens legislative, and judicial powers, are the rights of the people; and though the people have delegated those their original powers to others, in trust, for the benefit of the community, yet the rights themselves are reserved by the people, and cannot be absolutely parted with by the people to those persons who are employed to conduct the business of the state. J 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8444 “ Resolved, That the constitution of England is held by the King, Lords, and Commons, and other officers appointed by the people in trust, for the benefit of the people ; and though these trustees may regulate and improve the constitution, yet they cannot alter or subvert it without committing treasom against the nation. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8445 Resolved, That Magna Charta, or THE GREAT CHARTER OF THE LIBERTIES OF ENGLAND, made in the reign of king John; THE PETITION OF RIGHTS, assented to by parliament in the reign of kin: Charles 1st and the several laws made at ani in consequence of the Glorious Revolution in the year 1688, are declaratory of those parts of the constitution of England, which are iar and by them respectively declared. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8446 “ Resolved, That the office of KING of England was not instituted by the people merely as an office of profit and honour to the king, but he was so appointed as chief trustee and guardian of the constitution and rights of the people, and that important and laborious penal duties are annexed to the regal office, the objects of which are to promote the good of the people, and preserve their rights in full vigour from innovation and corruption. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8447 Resolved, That it is the duty of the king to preserve the constitution of England and the rights of the people against every encroachment; and in order to enforce that duty, the following oath is required to be taken by every king on his accession to the throne of Great Britain, to wit: the arch-bishop or bishop shall say—“ Will you solemnlypro“ mise and swear to govern the people of this “kingdom of England, and the dominions thereto belonging, according to the statutes “in parliament agreed on, and the laws and customs of the same?’ 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8448 he king or queen shall say, ‘ I solemnly “promise so to do.’ Archbishop or bishop— Will you to your power cause law and jus‘tice in mercy to be executed in all your judgments?’ ANS. ‘I will’ 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8449 “ After this, the king or queen, laying his or her hand on the holy Gospels, shall say— ‘The things which I have before promised I “will perform and keep; so help me God’ and then shall kiss the book. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8450 “ Resolved, That his present majesty, kin, George 8rd, on his accession to the throne o these realms, did solemnly take the said oath. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8451 “ Resolved, That the constitutional rights of the people have been violated, and that it is the duty of the people, in the present atarming crisis, to assemble and inquire into the innovations or infringements which have been made upon the rights of the people, and how far the declarations of the constitution, as they were settled at the aforesaid Revolution, remain in force, and which of them have been violated, and by whom; and also whether such innovations, infringements, and violations, have been committed from the negligence or corruption of those who have been intrusted with the government of the state. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8452 “ Resolved, That this society do invite the ee to meet in their respective nighbourjoods, to elect one or more person or persons as delegates to meet in a convention, to be held on the day of. next, at such place as shall be appointed by the secret committee of this society; and that the poe so elected do forthwith transmit to the secretary of this society, No. 9, Piccadilly, London, the vouchers of their several elections, in order that the place of meeting may be duly notified to them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8453 “ Resolved, That it is the right and the bounden duty of the people to punishall traitors against the nation, and that the followin, words are now not a part of the oath of allegiance; to wit, ‘I declare that it is not lawful, ‘upon any pretence whatever, to take arms against the king.’ 
GARROW 8454 You have been already examined
GARROW 8456 Were you a member of the London Corresponding Society 
GARROW 8458 And attended the division meetings 
GARROW 8460 Look at that paper [showing hima pepe); were papers of that sort distributed at the vision meeting of the society 
GARROW 8462 Did you ever see them there; I saw one of them handed round at the division st Snow-hill. 
GARROW 8463 When 
GARROW 8465 About how long ago 
GARROW 8467 Did you see more than one 
EYRE 8469 What mamber was that division? —The division that met at Scotney’s, the Three Tuns, on Snow-hill, I think No. 11. 
EYRE 8471 If he can take upon himself to say that it is the same paper. 
EYRE 8472  Countrymen, you are told by those who are in office, that you arein danger of a Freoeb invasion. 
EYRE 8473 “You are told by those who are cat of office, that you are in danger of a Hessiaa ur Hanoverian invasion. 
EYRE 8474 “In either case arms will be of use to yous agree among yourselves, get arms, and the use of them ! 
GARROW 8475 Did you at any time find any pikes in the house of Orrock in Edinburgh
GARROW 8477 Did you find any pikes there? —Yes—to the amount of thirty-three, finished aud unfinished. 
GARROW 8478 ‘Those which you state to be finished, had blades and shafts] suppose
GARROW 8480 Did you find any in the possession of any other person
GARROW 8482 Were they likewise blades without shafts? 
GARROW 8483 —There was one shaft. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8485 I mentioned hast night that I had proved the order to be given for them before the apprehension of the prifoner; the order by Watt and M‘Bwan. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8486 Mr. Gidts
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8488 We have proved that Stock produced to Watt and Ross a printed circular ietter, signed Thomas Hardy, which is verbatim the same circular letter, a bandle of which was found in the possession of the prisoner; we have already proved that there was a conversation at that time, in which Watt desired that Stock would bring about a communication with Hardy ; we certainly have not proved that Stock brought about that communication ; but, I submit to your lordships, that if we prove the order for the pikes to have been given previous to that time, that the execution of that order follows naturally, and necessarily upon it. 
GARROW 8489 We submit to your lordships that it is evidence to go to the jury, that the pikes which were found in the possession of Watt, are those pikes which were made in execution of the order given by Watt to Orrock, antecedent to the apprehension of the prisoner. 
EYRE 8491 It appears to me that there is a clear, satisfactory ground upon which the evidence must be received, at the same time that you would be at liberty to insist that the execution of the order afterwards does not personally affect the prisoner, but it is a circumstance in evidence to establish the truth of the evidence of the order that the things were found afterwards correspin with the ore 
EYRE 8493 Nor do I wish to Ee you to admit any such thing. 
EYRE 8494 Mr. Garrow to ‘Middleton, — Flow many did you find
EYRE 8496 twelve blades without handles. 
EYRE 8497 What was it that led you to search Watt’s house 
EYRE 8499 8, : 
EYRE 8500 In what part of the house did you find them 
EYRE 8502 Did you deliver to Mr. Clerk, the sheriff of Edinburgh, those which you found in the house of Orrock, and those which you found in the house of Watt
EYRE 8504 Were the shaft and the blade united, at the time you found them, or apart
EYRE 8506 ‘the manner in which they are attached is, I understand, by a screw 
EYRE 8508 Mr. Lockhart, you said, was with you
EYRE 8511 To the Jury !— Or to your lordship. 
EYRE 8512 Is it to change any thing in the testimony you have given
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8514 Having mentioned this, I would ask, had you any talk with Hillier about the ale-house in Green-Arbourcourt
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8516 When did you first see Hillier’s pike? 
EYRE 8517 This leads to 4 cross-examination. A witness desires to exlain a circumstance in his evidence; I should ery unwilling to introduce a new examination. 
GARROW 8518 Does not your lordship think it fit to inquire whom he has talked to since he was examined? 
EYRE 8519 No; I do not think it necessary; his explanation seems a fair one, to prevent any misinterpretation of his evidence. 
EYRE 8520 Mr. Attorney General:'—If a witness is to come afterwards, in this way, to explain his evidence, his not stating this in his original examination cuts out a great number of material questions. 
EYRE 8521 I perfectly with you; this explanation ought to be relave with abundant caution by the jury; and from another circumstance, the sort o practice we have got-into, of any man’s printing such accounts as his industry may collect in court, is certainly a very inconvenient practice, because it may lead to conversations with witnesses, and may induce these explanations. The jury will understand that the explanation is made in that situation of things, and theywill form their own judgment upon it. Yet still,Ithink, it should rest with the esplanation that the witness desires to offer. 
GARROW 8522 You are what they call sheriff Clerk’s depute, in the city of Edinburgh 
GARROW 8524 Did you go with Middleton to the house of Orrock 
GARROW 8526 Were you present at the finding of any blades for pikes at Watt’s honse 
GARROW 8528 How many did you find upon the first search 
GARROW 8530 Where were they
GARROW 8532 How soon did you renew your search
GARROW 8534 How many did you find at the second search 
GARROW 8536 Blades
GARROW 8538 Pend you make any trial whether the blades and the pole as you call it, would fit each sother
GARROW 8540 Where is the pole
GARROW 8542 Where did you deposit the several things that you found at Watt’s house 
GARROW 8544 I believe you are sheriff of Edinburgh 
GARROW 8546 Was that box, and the thing the witness calls the pole, deposited in your care as sheriff
GARROW 8548 Except then when they were delivered to Lockhart, they have been constantly locked wp under your care 
GARROW 8550 Did you return these to the sheriff, which you had from him, after the Edinburgh trials
GARROW 8552 And are these the same the sheriff delivered to you 
GARROW 8554 Is Stock still living at Edinburgh, or has he absconded
GARROW 8556 Open the box, and take out some of those blades. [Mr. Lockhart opened the-box.] 
GARROW 8557 Is that what you call the battle-axe 
GARROW 8559 Ilave you got any other sort of blades there
GARROW 8561 You Vain to me, in taking one of these blades out, to screw off something—what is that

ATTORNEYGENERAL 8570 “ Mr. Frost, Mr. Hull, count Zenubio, Mr. Tooke, Mr. Wills, lord Sempill, Mr. Bonney, Mr. Kydd, Mr. Satchell, Mr. J. Martin, Mr. Ausel, Mr. Holcroft, Mr. Balmanne, capt. T. Harwood, Mr. Parkinson, Mr. J. Williams, Dr. Kentish, Mr. Margurot, Mr. Hardy. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8571 “ Mr. Gay, Mr. Pellatt, and Mr. Thomas Fossett, were elected members. 
EYRE 8572 Does it appear that the Gay, who was in prison, is the Gay of Duke-street? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8573 Call Mr. Tourll and Mr. Evans. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8574 Do you know whose hand-writing that paper is
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8576 You mentioned a person of the name of Gay, who was in the King’s-bench prison
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8578 Do you know where he lived before he went into the King’s-bench prison
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8580 Was it Duke-street 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8582 My Lord, I hav now finished the evidence on the part of the prosecution. 
EYRE 8861 The witness should be told, that there is a question touching the conduct of the society, whether it is highly criminal, or whether it is innocent; the witness understanding that, and being willing to answer, may answer ; but he must understand that, in consequence of his answering the questions, on the part of the prisoner, he will also be liable to be examined on the same points, on the part of the prosecution; and that I cannot then protect him, if any question is put to him that he would wish not to answer, 
EYRE 8863 Every witness should understand that when he is called. 
EYRE 8865 It is right he should be told. 
EYRE 8868 The witness has had a fair notice of the situation he isin ; if oe pioones to subject himself to answer, very weil. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8877 I object to that question ; you should ask him what his object as. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8878 was, 
EYRE 8880 I apprehend the more correct question would be, what were the views of the society with respect to the House of Lords. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8891 I object to that question. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8893 I will not have the question put in that form; I am afraid of questions that ought not to be put. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8894 I am afraid of pe pete that ought to be put, but of questions ought not to be put. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8895  ‘saan 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8897 I think you would not have made the observation if you did. 
EYRE 8899 What is the question that ae think there is any doubt about ; letus know what the question is, and the Court will give their assistance towards mediating. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 8900 The attorney general objected, because the question was not put ia the proper style. 
EYRE 8901 I do not exactly, at this moment, know to what it pointed ; it escaped me. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8908 That Gentleman asked you whether Mr. Hardy had ever communicated to you that letter from Sheffield, you immediately said no. Now I should be glad to ask you how you knew what letter it was that that gentleman alluded to—what is the letter that you mean to speak of, when you say Hardy never comsnunicated it to you 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8910 I should be glad to know what Sheffield letter you mean 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8912 The witness overheard that. ‘ 
EYRE 8914 It is time for me to interpose, and not to suffer these things to pass at. the table. I agree that you did ask the question in that manner, because I have taken itso; but I also agree, that you ought not to interrupt the cross-examination ; they will put their questions in such manner as they please, and you will setit right, if they 
EYRE 8915 ‘ put it wrong, when you come to re-examine the witness ; there ought not to be any breaking in upon one another, because one gentlethinks that another gentleman did not put the question in the manner he put it; he 
EYRE 8916 “puts the question in the manner he understands the gentleman put it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8918 I must entreat your lordships to ms and I hold it to be m duty to do it. There is a gentleman who is not counsel in the cause, who sits next Mr. Gibbs, and when I asked the witness the queetion, what letter it was, I heard him in this part of the Court, asI believe some other gentlemen did, say, “ The letter about pikes. Now Ido not mean to say, and I desire in justice to that gentleman to observe, that I do not mean to say, by any means that he intended the witness should hear that explanation given to Mr. Gibbs; I do not believe it; I therefore disavow that; but I must desire that no gentleman should sit next the counsel for the defendant, or the counsel for the crown, who under, not the colour, I will not. use that word, but under the fact of commuNicating and conversing with the defendant’s counsel, should, in point of fact, lead, I do not mean to say in point of intention—the witness to giving an answer which he could not have given. 
EYRE 8920 There can be no objection at all; the Court will certainly not interpose to prevent your sitting next the Counsel who are assigned for the prisoner, and giving them .any assistance that your partiticular knowledge may enable you to give them; at the same time that situation is a delicate one, and you will undoubtedly take particular care to avoid any thing that may give any ground to any man alive to suppose you donot make a correct useof it. I do not suppose you do otherwise, I have not taken any notice of your conduct that authorizes me to make any objection to it; but if you said any thing loud enough to be taken notice of by the witness, you were not so correct as you should have been. 
EYRE 8922 I do not desire you should, for if you can, though not assigned counsel for the prisoner, by your particular knowledge, be of any use to his 
EYRE 8923 Counsel, the Court have no objection to your giving any sort of communication you can possibly give. 
EYRE 8924 Mr. Attorney General.I heard said as distinctly as I bear myself, when I put the question, “ the letter about the pikes, 
EYRE 8925 I had really taken down the answer of the witness before any part of this conversation arose—“ that de had never heard of any letter from Sheftield about pikes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8926 tow long have you been a member of this society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8928 — are of the division No. 2, I understand
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8930 Who introduced you into this society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8932 Where does he live?i—He did live at No. 27, in Pall-Mall? he is removed to Horsedown. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8933 Were you at the Globe-tavern on the 20th of January 1794 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8935 Were you at Chalk Farm upon the 14th of April 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8937 Being at the Globe tavern upon the 20th of January, 1794, am I to understand you to say, that nothing passed there but what was quite peaceable and right, according to your notion 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8939 Did you ever see a printed account of what passed there
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8941 Which were afterwards printed 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8943 Were the resolutions that you saw in print a correct account of what really did pass there
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8945 Then that being a correct account of what did pass upon the 20th of January 1794, you mean to state to the Court and the Jury that the proceedings, as contained in that printed paper, were according to your ideas correct und poate and according 1o the law of the Jand, as you understand 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8947 Tt so, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8948 You said you were at Chalk Farm 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8950 And you also mean to state as far as your opinion goes, that the proccedings at ChalkFarm were exactly what they really ought to be
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8952 Perhaps you were at the meeting in Breillat'’s yard when delegates were chosen to be sent to Scotland 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8954 Not being there, perhaps you did not know the fact that a delegate was sent to the convention in Scotland 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8956 Knowing the fact, you approved of that measure, I suppose 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8958 Did you ever hoar of the Secret Committee in your society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8960 ‘ ‘Then having -heard of the Secret Com:mittec, do you happen to know who the Secret Committee were composed of 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8962 ‘Bless me! you were a member of the Corresponding Society, which had a Secret Com:mittee; all their transactions were peaceable, and yet you do not know who the Secret Committee were 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8964 Every answer that you have given to me yet proves to me that you are an honest man. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8965 This society, whose proceedings wer feqeobl, had a Secret Committee 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8967 Was it known among the body in genen! who the Secret Committee were 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8969 ‘Then youmean to say, giving this characte of the proceedings of this society, that ya remained in the society; there being a secret committee of persons whose names you dd not know, of course you did not know whit were the proceedings of any committee, the names of which committee you did ma know 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8971 When the prisoner and some ether peopk were apprehended, do not you know thst there was another Secret Committee formec
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8973 Do not you know that there was anothe: Secret Comunittee formed 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8975 You have heard it in your divisions
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8977 You left the society afterwards 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8979 Of course, when there was that suspicaco about the society, you did nos choose tw ca tinue any longer 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8981 Who were your delegates to the Scotch Seavennots 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8983 Were you in the society, think you, before the 6th of August 1792
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8985 I hope you bave seen the address of the 6th of August, 1792
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8987 You do pot know any thing of the contest: of it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8989 You say you know nothing at all about th Sheffield letter 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8991 Did you ever hear of a circular Jetter that wey sent into Scotland to call a conventian
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8993 Who carried it into Scotland 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8995 Do you know a person of the name of Stock 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8997 Hecollent yourself
ATTORNEYGENERAL 8999 How did the printed circular letter, with the name of T. Hardy at the bottom of it, get into Scotland upon your oath 
EYRE 9001 How 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9003 How do you kaow that it was sent there
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9005 In point of fact, did you ever hear whether that circular letter went or not
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9007 hat is no answer, so might 1; 1 might or might not, but, in point of tact, did you ever hear whether that circular letter ever went
EYRE 9009 But the question is, have you heard it or not
EYRE 9011 I have taken it down, that you heard ot a circular letter which went into Scotland 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9013 Where did you hear that 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9015 Did you hear any thing what this circular letier was about, what were the contents of it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9017 You consider all the proceedings at the Globe-tavern on the 20th of January, and also the proceedings at Chalk Farm, as in your opinion, quite peaceable and constitutional proceedings 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9019 That is your notion of the matter
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9021 You sing some songs now and then in your society do not you 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9023 How came you never te sing them in the socicty 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9025 Is it done on purpose, or how happens that
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9027 I hope you do not mean to say that there were no songs sung at your dinner
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9029 Did you never hear of a very good song, called “ God save the Rights of Man 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9031 Perhaps you sung it sometimes yourself
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9033 Can you tell us what the contents of itare 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9035 Perhaps you could inform me if you were to see it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9037 Did you ever heat of a song that has this chorus : 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9038  Plant, plant the tree, fair freedom’s tree, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9039 “ "Midst dangers, wounds, and slaughter, Fach Patriot’s breast its soil shall be, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9040 “ And Tyrant’s bluod its water. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9041 Do you recollect that song
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9043 You have heard this song sung, you say, “Plant, plant the tree?’ —I cannot say, upon my recollection, that I ever have heard it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9044 Then how came you to tell me you had heard something about “ Plant, plant the tree 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9046 When I asked you, and I appeal to the Court and the Jury, if ever you heard a song, the chorus of which was “ Plant, plant the tree—you said yes
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9048 Did not you tell me you had heard that particular sung
EYRE 9050 You certainly gaid you had heard the song, “ Plant, plant the tree."
EYRE 9052 You are quite at liberty to explain, but you did say that you had heard the song, “ Plant, plant the tree
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9054 How many songs of Mr. Thelwall’s have you ever seen, or had in your possession 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9056 Then you mean to swear you think there was no harm in Mr. Thelwall’s songs
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9058 Do you mean to swear that you thought there was no harm in Mr. Thelwall’s songs
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9060 Be so good as tell us the names of some of Mr. Thelwall’s songs, as you have all of them 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9062 Tell us the name of some of them 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9064 You have all of Mr. Thelwall’s songs, but you cannot tell the title of one of them 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9066 They were printed all upon one sheet of paper, I believe 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9068 And dispersed all over the country, were they not 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9070 Tfave you those songs in your possession
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9072 What were the titles of them
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9074 Look at this paper, read a part of that song, and tell me whether thatis one? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9075 Goddard
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9077 “ God save the Rights of Man
EYRE 9080 If the song is proved to have been sung in the society, then itis competent to ask whether that song is peaceable; but unless the song is proved to have been sung there 
EYRE 9081 Goddard
EYRE 9083 He has said that all the proceedings there were peaceable and orderly ; then if this song is proved to have been sung there, there certainly can be no. impropriety in asking him whether, according to his judgment, that proceeding was peaceable and orderly, but it is not proved that it was sung there. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9085  Look at that and tell me whether that was printed by order of the Corresponding Society, or not
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9087 Had you ever a paper of that sort in your jhand
EYRE 9127 Nor heard of it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9129 When did you be come a member of this society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9131 Early in March 1792, or in February
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9133 Did you dine at the Crown: and Anchortavern upon the second of May last?

ATTORNEYGENERAL 9146 Were you at Chalk Farm on the 14th f April
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9148 Were on at the Globe-tavern upon the 20th of Jancary
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9150 You saw, however, the proceedings at the Globe-tavern, which were afterwards in print; you saw the resolutions that were entered into 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9152 You approved of thenr
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9154 If you had had any objections to them when you saw them, you would of have stated them to your society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9156 If you had, you would have stated them to your society; you were a delegate 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9158 For how long 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9160 Do not you recollect the time whenf—It was about five or six months back. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9161 You ere well acquainted with your Spence, in Holborn 
EYRE 9163 When did you cease to be a delegate 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9165 You know nothing of Spence, who lives in Holborn 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9167 You have bought a book there now and then 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9169 Were you ever there at the exercising time 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9171 Do you know Franklow of Lambethi-I have seen him.

ATTORNEYGENERAL 9178 When did you first see his pike
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9180 Did you -never see his pike till he was taken-up
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9182 You have seen Hillier
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9184 I asked you about Hillier.
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9186 You had no secret committee in the London Corresponding Society, I hope, had you
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9188 Do you know of a committee, sometimes ealled the Committee of Correspondence 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9190 Who were the members of it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9192 Has your society a committee without knowing the members of it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9194 You know Mr. Hodgson, perhaps, the hatter, inthe Broadway, Westminster 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9196 Upon your oath, when the prisoner at the bar, and the other members of your secret committee, were taken up, was not there another secret committee, named by Mr. Hodgson 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9198 Do you knew of it. now 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9200 Then you mean to swear that you do not know that there was such a committee 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9202 Then was there a secret committee appointed by any body else? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9204 Yes
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9206 Have you never been in Academy-court, Chancery-lane
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9208 Then if any secret committee met there, you know nothing about it 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9210 Do you know Smith, of Portsmouth-street? Do you know one Burks 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9212 Do you know a man of the name of Higins 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9214 Did you never hear of those, or any other persons being a secret committee, to succeed the secret committee of the London Corresponding Society, that bad existed before those people were taken up 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9216 you never heard that there was a secret committee hefore those people were taken up

ATTORNEYGENERAL 9228 Have-not you heard the members of the society complain, that they did not know who the’members of the Secset Committee of Correspondence were
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9230 Recollect yourself 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9232 ou have said there was a secfet committee, whose names you did not know; uponyour oath, do you know the reason why their ye were kept secret
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9234 Those will not do; did you ever see in the society, a pgper,.that. the Ins complain of one thing, and the Outs of another, and therefore. advise you to get arms
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9236 Perhaps you never saw “ La Guillotine; ar, George’s Head in a Basket 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9238 You never saw it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9240 You say you never heard of this letter from Sheffield about pikes
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9242 Then you mean to say, you never heard that letter read in the society ; have you ever heard of its coming to London 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9244 It surprised you ia pa no doubt
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9246 Did you ever see the address of the 6th of. August 1792
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9248 An address from the Landon Correspond-’ ing Society to the nation, when they talked of petitioning parliament no more
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9250 Do you know Carter, the bilksticker
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9252 Did he stick up any bill for you
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9254 Then you knew it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9256 Do'not you know the society ordered it to be. stuck up in the night
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9258 Do not you know that there was a debate in your society about paying the expenses of this man’s prosecution
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9260 What was he to receive money for 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9262 Do you mean to say that sticking these bills up at night, and the proceedings, such as they were at Chalk Farm, are peaceable and orderly proceedings
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9264 pends upon the contents of the, bill; and as to the proceedings at Chalk Farm, 1 do not know every word that was said there. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9265 You mean to say that the proceedings were orderly and peaceable
EYRE 9267 Did you say you were at Chalk Farm 
EYRE 9269 Were the resolutions there put to the question
EYRE 9271 Did you vote for them 
EYRE 9273 Did you vote for them
EYRE 9275 Do you vote for things without knowing what they are 
EYRE 9277 Do not you see what difficulties you might bring yourself into, by concurring in things without knowing what they are? were you ear enough to hear what they were 
EYRE 9279 How did you vote 
EYRE 9281 Did you vote then upon the confidence you had in any body that was there? or what induced you to vote for a resolution you did not hear 
BOWER 9313 What may your business, or profession be
BOWER 9315 Were you a member of the Constitational Society 
BOWER 9317 You were a member of both societies
BOWER 9319 When were you elected a member of the Corresponding Society? —I imagine better than two years ago. 
BOWER 9320 How long have you belonged to the Constitutional Society 
BOWER 9322 You heard several men speak upon politics? —I have heard several very clever speeches. 
BOWER 9323 Were they clever speeches by clever men
BOWER 9325 Did they strike you as clever speeches from clever men
BOWER 9327 You took up your idea of politics from them 
BOWER 9329 You did not go to these societies to read the public papers, or to read the debates in both Houses of Parliament 
BOWER 9331 Which way then did you get your informa tion? 
BOWER 9332 Wills —What information ? 
BOWER 9333 Mr. Bower—Upon politics; you said ie went there not having an Spron aay of attending both Houses of Parliament 
BOWER 9335 Upon what subject
BOWER 9337 Were any subjects discussed that did not relate to politics 
BOWER 9339 Upon your oath, when you went there, did you expect to hear arly discussion upon any subject but politics
BOWER 9341 That is no answer to my question; wha you went there, you said, you went there because you had no opportunity of attending the Houses of parliament, and went to hear clever then speak; upon what subject did you gu expecting to hear them speak 
BOWER 9343 And those only 
BOWER 9345 Was that the place where you took up your constitutional doctrine 
BOWER 9347 From the newspapers 
BOWER 9349 And you went to the Constitutional Society not having opportunities to attend the House of Commons, to supply that defect
BOWER 9351 You had no other means of supplying the information 
BOWER 9353 Did you attend frequently
BOWER 9355 I know nothing.—I ask you
BOWER 9357 Did you not, upon your oath, attend them weekly 
EYRE 9359 You mean you attended them as often as you could 
BOWER 9361  Were youatall acquainted with the proceedings of the society —Very little ; Tnever looked into their books. 
BOWER 9362 Then you did not know of any of their transactions which might bring some of them, or those they employed, into difficulties No, 
BOWER 9363 You never knew that any body was prosecuted fur assisting them in their views
BOWER 9365 Did you never hear of one William Carter
BOWER 9367 Then, of course, you never heard that he was in cunfinement at all
BOWER 9369 Do you recollect Carter, the bill sticker 
BOWER 9371 You heard nothing more of him but that there was such a man
BOWER 9373 That is all. You never heard that there was a subscription entered into for him
BOWER 9375 That is then what you now mean to swear distinctly, for I will not let you now go back ? Ido not say I gave two guineas, or five, but 
BOWER 9376 T only say I subscribed something, perhaps, to the poor man’s family. 
BOWER 9377 Did not vou say two or five guineas
BOWER 9379 Did you not, a minute ago, say you might: have given a shilling, or half-a-crown, or a guinea, or five guineas, to this man, in confinement, for sticking up bills
BOWER 9381 Your gestures will not do 
BOWER 9383 Ido not wish to confuse you ; the more distinct you give your answer the better; do you mean to say, upon your oath, that you did not recollect when you said, you might have given one, two, or five guineas to this man 
BOWER 9385 Did you give one, two, or five guineas 
BOWER 9387 Then, I understand, you now swear dis-: tinctly, you might give this man a shilling; but that you did not give him five guineas 
BOWER 9389 Upon your oath, you did not give this man two guineas, or five guineas
BOWER 9391 You never gave him a guinea, or five gui-. neas
BOWER 9393 Did you ever give him any thing 
BOWER 9395 Task you, whether you did, or not, subscribe any sum of money to the man who was in confinement, for sticking up bills for the society, and on that account
BOWER 9397 To whom did you give something 
BOWER 9399 Who asked you for it
BOWER 9401 What societies 
BOWER 9403 At the time you gave that, was a subscription put about for the relief of this man so in custody 
BOWER 9405 Did you attend one, or more of theee s0cieties 
BOWER 9407 Which was that
BOWER 9409 At which house 
BOWER 9411 Was it there you subscribed
BOWER 9413 Was Compton-street a place where the delegates met, or a division meeting Among the divisions, I believe; I did not belong to any delegate society, but to the common meeting. 
BOWER 9414 Which division of the society did you belong to
BOWER 9416 Did you go there as a visitor 
BOWER 9418 You are now a member of the Covent Garden division 
BOWER 9420 Then, whether you have been a member of that in Compton-street, you do not know 
BOWER 9422 The same division 
BOWER 9424 My question is, whether you belonged to one, or two divisions of this society 
BOWER 9426 Did you belong to more than two
BOWER 9428 When you werein the society, did you know any thing of any secret committee; perhaps a never heard of any such thing 
BOWER 9430 Of course you know nothing of any secret committee 
BOWER 9432 Ifa secret committee had been mentioned, it would have been to you a matter of surrise 
BOWER 9434 Did you ever hear of any letter that had been written by the prisoner —Never. 
EYRE 9445 You have brought rself into a scrape, only for the sake of a lourish, When you are upon your oath, if you would only speak plain English, you would be under no difficulty ; there is a great difference between a shilling and a guinea, and five guineas, therefore you should not have conveyed an idea that you did not know whether you gave one shilling, two shillings, one’ 
EYRE 9446 guinea, or five guineas. I would advise you, when you are upon your oath, never to by metaphor ; you have brought yourself into aevelties but I dare say you meant very right. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9447 I beg your lortship will ask him what he gave. 
EYRE 9448 How much did you give, in plain English
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9450 Will your lordship please to ask him if it was not a guinea. 
EYRE 9451 Do you say it was not a guineaf—A tew shillings, to the best of my knowledge. 
EYRE 9452 Under, or about five shillings
EYRE 9455 That is perfectly irregular. It was certainly absurd in the witness not to recollect that he was upon his cath, and to talk in that rhodomontade way. I dare say he meant to speak the truth. 
LAW 9485  You never heard of a letter from Sheffield about pikes 
LAW 9487 Did you never read that letter
LAW 9489 You never have read it. You say you have read the reports of the secret committee ; have yu never read it there 
LAW 9491 You continue a member of the Corresponding Society to this moment
LAW 9493 Did you ever see a paper like that circulated? —Inever have before now, I have heard of it, but I never saw it before. 
LAW 9494 Who introduced you into the society: A telation of mine.

LAW 9520 Did you hear the resolutions which were come to at those meetings 
LAW 9522 You have said that the proceedings of the Corresponding Society were peaceable 
LAW 9524 You have said, you heard the resolutions carried at Chalk-farm—were they peaceable
LAW 9526 Did you hear them, or not; I understood you said you did hear them
LAW 9528 Did you vote for them, or no
LAW 9530 How came it that you did not vote for them 
LAW 9532 you were there, and heard them, and they made no impression upon your conduct
LAW 9534 You have said you voted for them
LAW 9536 Did you vote against them 
LAW 9538 You took no part in them 
LAW 9540 Did you sup with your division that night

LAW 9553 Had you forgotten that circumstance, when I asked you just now 
LAW 9555 But you said, it was so long ago since you were in business, that you did not know what business you followed: how long is it since you have done business as a hair-dresser 
LAW 9557 And how long since you followed the business of a perfumer
LAW 9559 Did you cease to be both at the same time
LAW 9561 About twelve years ago
LAW 9563 Then having this perfect recollection that you have been a perfumer and a hair-dresser, about twelve years ago, how came you to tell me it was so long ago, you did not recollect what business you bad carried on 
EYRE 9565 What he said was, that it was so long ago since he carried on any business, he could not recollect what business he followed. 
LAW 9566 I shall not ask him another question. 
GARROW 9599 Have J taken you correctly, that you ceased to be s member in April, 1793
GARROW 9601 And since that, you have not been acquaint
GARROW 9602 Then I will not give you: trouble. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9638 I have no object to what the gentleman pleases to say
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9640 mediately asked him the intent, or ultimate end and design that this society had in view, and he told me it was a reform of parliament, that is to say, of the House of Commons, upon eaceable and constitutional principles; he farther added upon the same principles which his grace the duke cof Richmond and the right hon. William Pitt were engaged in, in the year 1782. I have frequently, in conversation, inquired of him, and tried to suck out, to gain what was the inteut of the society, when I heard something about these reports of the Committee of the House of Commons, and so on, and he told me by all means it was to obtain a parliamentary reform upon constitutional principles, in a peaceable manner. 
EYRE 9641 Since the report
EYRE 9643 Where did you see him 
EYRE 9645 Since the report
EYRE 9647 Recollect yourself
EYRE 9649 Therefore I stopt you, that you might recollect yourself. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9668 You did not belong to any of these societies
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9670 Did you ever see a paper published as the proccedings at Chalk-Farm, with Mr. Hardy’s name to it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9672 Did you ever see a paper published as the proceedings on the Oth of January, 1794, with Mr. llardy’s name to it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9674 Look at that paper? [showing it to the witness. ]—I do not recollect that I ever saw the fellow to this paper, or this paper before. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9675 Did you know that Mr. Hardy was a member ofa society that had published resolutions in support of Mr. Thomas Paine’s Rights of Man
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9677 Then I need not ask you, I take for granted, whether publishing those resolutions in favour of Paine’s Rights of Man, shows the sort of man that you would suppose honours the king? what is your answer to that
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9679 Did you cver see the bouk, called Paine’s Rights of Man
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9681 Do you know that Mr. Paine was a member of the Constitutional Society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9683 Do you happen to know Mr. Bogue, a dissenting minister 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9685 Do you happen to know whether he had any correspondence with Mr. Hardy 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9687 Did he inform you whether Mr. Bogue had given him any advice about the papers? Never such a thing was ever mentioned to me by Mr. Hardy. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9688 What did he say to you about Mr. Dogue, the dissenting minister at Portsmouth
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9690 Did he explain to you at all how he came to know any thing of Mr. Bogue of Portsmouth 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9692 So that you visited Mr. Hardy, he informed you he knew Mr. Bogue, a dissenting minister at Portsmouth, and you had not the curiosity to inquire what Mr. Hardy in London, had to do with Mr. Bogue, a dissenting minister at Portsmouth
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9694 Upon your oath, did Mr. Hardy ever tell you that he had or not been down at Portsmouth to visit any convicts on board a ship at Portsmouth
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9696 Nor that he had seen Mr. Bogue upon that occasion 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9698 You know nothing of Mr. Hardy’s sentiments about Paine’s works
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9700 am said you had read Paine’s work 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9702 Have you ever read any thing about honouring the king in it 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9704 I think you said you were much in Mr. Hardy’s confidence 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9706 Then he never told you any thing about the roceedings of the London Corresponding Society, either at Chalk-Farm or any of those other places
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9723 Thatis not a proper question. 
EYRE 9725 What the tenor of his conversation was, is, I suppose, your object. 
EYRE 9726 Mr. Attorney Generali cannot say 1 think it worth disputing. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9734 This convention that was talked ‘about—not having said one word about a convention. 
EYRE 9740 You have said you thought he did put confidence in you
EYRE 9742 I do not want to know the private history between you and him ; if you say you think he put confidence in you, it is very well. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9749 You are secretary to a society calling themselves the Friends of the People 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9751 You know there is a society in London called the Society for Constitutional Information 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9753 It may possibly have occurred to you, as secretary to the Society of the Friends of the People, to know that the latter society rejected all correspondence with the former
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9755 Did you happen to know that the prisoner at the bar was an associated member of that society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9757 Then you being secretary to the committee of the Society of the Friends of the People, and the Society of the Friends of the People having rejected all correspondence with the Society for Constitutional Information, you did not know that the prisoner was an associated member of the Society for Constitupane Information 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9759 Do you remember a letter being written by your society to the Society for Constituae Information, from lord John Russel 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9761 Do you remember any correspondence between your society, the Friends of the People, and a society at Sheffield
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9763 Do you recollect whether that was in the month of May, 1792, or not
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9765 Do you happen to know, that the society at Sheffield, in the month of May, 1792, wrote a letter to the Constitutional Society, whose correspondence your society bad rejected, saying, they would have nothing more to do with the Friends of the People, because they were not pursuing the principles of the rights of man
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9767 ‘Do you recollect what were the reasons why the Society of the Friends of the Feople would have nothing more to do with the Society for Constitutional Information
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9769 With reference to their having recommended Mr. Paine’s great plans of reform 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9771 Do you happen to know, that the London Corresponding Society have been going upon the same plans of reform 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9773 Did you ever see the London Corresponding Society’s address of the 6th of August, 1792 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9775 Did you ever see an address of the London Corresponding Society of the 20th of January, 1794
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9777 Have you seen the London aneeponing Suciety’s resolutions at Chalk-farm
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9779 They wrote to your society about a convention, I believe —They did. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9780 You rejected that
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9782 I believe your society had some correspondence with the London Corresponding Society ; during all these proceedings, do you recollect any application they made to you to know the principles of your society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9784 Did your society inform them what length they meant to go at that time
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9786 Do I understand you right, that you never heard of the prisoner’s being an associated member of the Constitutional Society whose correspondence your society had rejected; that you knew nothing of the address of the London Corresponding Society of the 6th of August, 1792; that you knew nothing except what you have learned now of the proceedings of the 20th of January, 1794, and of the proceedings at Chalk-farm
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9788 Look at this printed paper [showing it to the witneanl is this an account of the proceedings of your society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9790 As you were secretary to the society, you can inform me whether the nee whose names appear here, are all members of the Society of the Friends of the People
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9792 You are aware of the fact, supposing it to bea fact, that after the Society of the Friends of the People had rejected correspondence with the Constitutional Society, by their letter, that some individuals still remained members of both societies 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9807 That is a question never put. 
EYRE 9809 TI have often heard it put, and often heard it objected to; it is certainly nota strictly regular question; you are to ask his general character, and from thence the jury are to conclude, whether a man of such a character would commit such an offence; at the same time, in justice to the geet T must say I have known it asked a hundred times; I have very often myself objected to it. Mr. Garrow
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9837 Were you a member of the Corresponding Society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9867 You are not a member of the Corresponding Society, I beeve 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9882 How long have you ceased to be a member

ATTORNEYGENERAL 9894 When did you cease to be a member of the society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9896 Do you remember your society writing to the society for Constitutional Information, to desire you might have some members associated with them 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9898 Do you remember your society subscribing to Mr. Paine? —No; my division never did. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9899 So then you do not recollect any thing about the society having any thing to do with Mr. Paine’s Rights of Man
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9901 Did you ever meet in Exeter-street

ATTORNEYGENERAL 9946 How many divisions were there of the society, at the time you left them 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9948 Were there two or three, according to your knowledge

ATTORNEYGENERAL 9952 As you belonged to the society originally, who drew up your original code of laws 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9954 Was any body else employed along with Mr. Margarot to do it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9956 Upon your oath, do not you recollect who it was that was to draw up your original laws
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9958 Did you ever visit any body in the neighbourhood of London about it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 9960 Do you mean to swear that

ATTORNEYGENERAL 10030 Were you a member of any of those societies 
EYRE 10034 The material observation arising upon it is that it was unsent, because he had no business to open it. 
EYRE 10036 Its being unsent’ is, I think, a strong circumstance indeed, but its being unopened J do not think amounts to much. 
EYRE 10094 Do not take am thing for granted when you are examipings witness.

ATTORNEYGENERAL 10138 You had not got so far as that
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10140 You say you were at the Castle-hill
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10142 you remember that when somebody Proposed to petition the House of Commons, It was negatived, and it was determined to petition the House of Commons no more

BOWER 10401 Your pwnciples, however, that you state, are the right to a thorough reformation, a radical returm of the country, upon a system consistent with the rights of man. Were the rights of man described in that book and this Ietter 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10403 Read up that sentence : “ Jf the Society for Constitutional Information in London, should vouchsafe so far to notice us, as to enter into a connexion and correspondence with us, it cannot fail of promoting honour, and adding strength to our feeble endeavours, and to the common cause, which is the entire motive we have in view. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10407 That is put the letter we meant; but you may read that. 
BOWER 10408  this is not the paper that Iam examining to; but 1 have no objection in the world to his reading it. 
BOWER 10411 As you desire to have it read, let the witness read it aloud, “ Sir ; It is now abouts four months since this society farst formed itself into a regular body, then but very few in number; the enclosed will inform you of their increase, and which, is most probable, will soon become very numerous ; and notonly this large and populous town, but the whole neighbourhood, tor many miles round about, have an attentive eye upun us; most of the towns and vallages, indeed, are furming themsclves to good order and regularity, and the need we have of coasulting and communicating with those who are sincere friends, and able advocates for the same cause; for these reasons, we took the liberty of writing ta Mr. 
BOWER 10412 Horne Tvoke, that worthy friend and patriotfor the rights of the people, informing him of our earnest desires of entering into a cen-' nexion with the society of the same denomination with ours in London: His very obliging and affectionate answer favours us wit your address; In consequence, we have taken the liberty, herewith to transmit to you some resolves, which were passed at our last meetings by the whole body; and the committee was charged with the dispatch of printing, and forwarding them to you accordingly, for the purpose of submitting them to the consideration of your society, ta make such use of them as they think most prudent. 
BOWER 10413 “ You will also notice the Belpar address ; they applied to us, about two munths ago, for instructions, as to our mode of conducting, &c. had not then formed themselves into any regular association. Belpar is nearly thirty miles from this place, in Derbyshire, and cight or ten miles from Derby. 
BOWER 10414 f the Society for Constitutional Information, in London, should vouchsafe so far to notice us, as to enter into a connexion and correspondence with us, it cannot fail of promoting honour, and adding strength to our feeble endeavours, and to the common cause, which is the entire motive we have in view. Tam, sir, with the greatest respeet and esteem, your sincere friend,

You will be so obliging as to let the packet remain with you ; until he call for it, as by this post I have ; wrote him thereof. We have given him our manner of proceeding, from our setting out to this time, and hope it may be of some use ; the improvement we are about to adopt is certainly the best for managing large bodies, as in great and populous towns, viz. dividing ; them into small bodies or meetings of ten Persons cach, and those ten to appoint a delegate: ten of these delegates form another meeting, and so on, delegating from one another, till at last are reduced to a proper number for constituting the committee, or ; grand council.

BOWER 10427 Do you believe it to be his hand-writing
BOWER 10429 You have seen him write

BOWER 10485 You have seen them in circulation there; have you not 
BOWER 10487 Did you at that time, or your society, circulate the books which are referred to in those resolutions—I mean this part, “ we declare that we have derived more true knowledge from the two works of Mr. Thomas Paine, intituled,Rights of Man, part the first and second than from any other author on the subject— the practice, as well as the principle of government, is laid down in those works in a manner so clear and irresistibly convincing, that this society do hereby resolve to give their thanks to Mr. Paine for his two said publications, intituled Rights of Man, part the first and second
BOWER 10489 Iam not talking about their being proved to bea libel, but whether these books were circulated by your society, about Sheffield, as the principles of government which you had, adopted
BOWER 10491 Were they circulated by the members of your society, in the neighbourhood of Sheftield, in very great numbers

BOWER 10520 How came you to say, in your resolutions, that they were increased to nearly two thowsand, if they were only two hundred
BOWER 10522 You begin by stating, “ This society, com posed chiefly of the manufacturers of Sheffield, egan about four months ago, and is already increased to nearly two thousand members, and is daily increasing ; was not that fifteen, sixteen, or eighteen hundred more than you had at the time
BOWER 10524 Did people attend the meetings who were not members

BOWER 10530 Supposing government had attempted to disperse you
BOWER 10532 You do not know, you said, whether there wasany intentionatall aboutaltering the House of Lords, or about the House of Lords in any respect

BOWER 10536 Was Martin, the person who signed this, the last witness

ATTORNEYGENERAL 10645 By whose direction did you direct it to Samuel Ashton, esq.
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10647 Did any of them know Mr. Ashton’s situation in life
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10649 You told us the other day, when you were here, that you did not know that Mr. Hardy had been an associated member of the Constitutional Society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10651 jouseeyour letter is of the 24th of May
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10653 Do you know, that the same Mr. Ashton, upon the 26th of the same month, wrote to the Constitutional Society, in London, a letter, which I hold now in my hand, stating, that he had received your moderate letter, the letter of the Friends of the People; an stating, to that Society, that, as your principles were not according to the rights of man, the Sheffield Society would have nothing ‘to do with you, except so far as the Constitutional Society would afterwards permit
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10655 Have you had any communication with Mr. Ashton since
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10657 A short time previous to this, I think about the 27th of March, your Society, the Friends of the People, had expressed their reasons for having nothing to do with the Constitutional Society; and had stated to them, that the would have no more correspondence with them
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10659 It was before this letter of your's to Sheffield 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10661 Did you know, that twelve members of that very Sheffield Society, to which you were writing, had been associated with the Constitutional Society, whose correspondence you had before rejected
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10663 Do you mean to say, that, at the time you permitted this letter to go from the Friends of the People, to Sheffield, that you knew that that Sheffield Society had twelve members associated with that Constitutional Society, with whom your Society had refused to correspond 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10665 T do not mean to insinuate that you did, for I do not believe that you did—then, you did not know that fact
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10667 You observed my learned friend read to you a great many very respectable names; 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10668 ow many of those gentlemen have quitted your society 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10671 Your society received this letter of the 14th, from Sheffield, as a proof of their moderation
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10673 And you treated it so, of course, and knew nothing of the letter that, on the 26th of May, they wrote to the Constitutional Society, such as I have been stating to you 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10675 You were going to state, that some gentle. men had left your society about this time
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10677 Do you recollect the names of them
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10679 Have you had the curiosity to read over the names of those respectable gentlemen, whose names are printed jn this list Certainly. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10680 Can you inform me how many of those entlemen were, and continue to be mem ie of that Constitutional Society, all corre pondence with which you had rejected
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10696 When did Ms. Wharton become a member of your Society
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10698 I presume you always inquired who the persons were that you addressed your letters to, before you wrote an; thing to them !—Yes. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10699 Is lord Daer a member of your society
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10701 I understood you to say, there was an aiswer to your letter of the 24th of May, from Sheffield? —Yes ; there was. Was that from the same Mr. Ashton
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10703 In as moderate terms as the letter you bad answered 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10705 Do you remember whether that letter, in those moderate terms, was dated before or after the 26th of ag hice must have beea dated after, because the answer was on 24th of May, and this is the reply to that answer. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10706 It might have been written by the retura of the post 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10720 Did your society know what had been the proceedings of the British Convention; I do not speak of the Scotch Convention, but the British Convention 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10722 I observe you say, the answer must be dated later than the 26th
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10724 Why
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10726 If your letter went from London on the 24th, and was answered by the return of post, the date of the answer must be the 26th? 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 10729 Did you ever know a man who was both a republican and a constitutional man, in one post ?

ATTORNEYGENERAL 10897 What did he amean? 
GARROW 10939 I shall not trouble you with the quests the gentleman has Fepeaiel several is whether you are a traitor, and ought 0 hanged; I shall not ask you whetber have been guilty of high treason, ea These papers that were thrown abot streets at Sheffield, alarmed, very consider) you, who were called democrats 
GARROW 10941 And made it, as you thought, ness that you should procure arms for your defence 
GARROW 10943 To what extent now did this dreadful arm, which made it neces: to procure as your own defence go; how many P these arm themselves in cot ce 0 
GARROW 10944 dreadful alarms 
GARROW 10946 You have been asked a good deal your own conduct, no doubt you P! had oot musket and bayonet 
GARROW 10948 Nor pike 
GARROW 10950 Upon your oath, you had neither a musket nor a pike
GARROW 10952 Netwithstanding all this dread and excitation in the streets, you still continued to kee yourself unarmed 
GARROW 10954 Which of the magistrates was it you applied to, for you forgot to mention his name, to prevent these desperate people from destroying you all
GARROW 10956 I beg pardon, I made a mistake, it was the secretary of state you applied tof—No, asa society we never applied. 
GARROW 10957 I thought we did not understand one another; which of the magistrates was it that, as an individual, you applied to
GARROW 10959 You applicd to the secretary of state perhaps
GARROW 10961 Did any body apply 
GARROW 10963 Did you not communicate these alarming threats toany body 
GARROW 10965 ‘ou made no application to any body 
GARROW 10967 You are an accurate man; I see you take the duke of Richmond’s and Mr. Pitt’s plan, and all these things, most perfectly; there were papers thrown about the streets, desiring the opposite party, opposite to the democrats, to destroy all people of a different persuasion 
GARROW 10969 That was the same paper that desired people to arm against foreign invasion and domestic enemies
GARROW 10971 Did pee ever see any paper distributed in Sheffield by the opposite party, except that paper that I describe, as an invitation to arm against domestic enemies and foreign invasion 
GARROW 10973 Upon which your society immediately adopted. their words, and advised the democrats to arm, for the protection of property? 
EYRE 10975 It is no question ;. it is an assertion. 
GARROW 10976 Did not your society adopt the very words of it, as an invitation for the people to arm, for the protection of property
GARROW 10978 Did they not adopt the very language of that paper, which you stated to be an excitement
GARROW 10980 And did you not, in consequence of that apprehension, adopt the very words 
GARROW 10982 The duke of Richmond’s plan, and Mr. Pitt’s, were the things you adopted 
GARROW 10984 Have the goodness to inform a very ignorant man, which I profess myself to be, about all these things; what was this plan of the duke of Richmond's and Mr. Pitt’s
GARROW 10986 What did you take Mr. Pitt’s plan for a more equal representation to be 
GARROW 10988 That you took to be Mr. Pitt’s plan
GARROW 10990 So much for the accuracy of your informa. 
GARROW 10991 tion, That gentleman read to you something about rights of man from the duke of Richmond’s plan; those were the only doctrines, of the rights of man, that ever you troubled yourselves with at Sheffield, were they; the duke has introduced an expression about the rights of man; did you read any other publications about the rights of man at Sheftield
GARROW 10993 You were a cutler 
GARROW 10995 Tom Paine’s Rights of Man, had not you
GARROW 10997 That is not an answer; you know every cutler in Sheffield had one; you had a cheap copy, had you
GARROW 10999 I dare say you have seen the best edition ; 
GARROW 11000 have you one of the cheap copies
GARROW 11002 I am sorry to be so troublesome, but I 
GARROW 11003 must have an answer
GARROW 11005 I do not ask you whether you read it to any human creature but yourself; do you happen to have one 
GARROW 11007 A cheap copy; was it made a present of to you, or how did you get it
GARROW 11009 A subscription of the society
GARROW 11011 Upon your oath, to the amount of how many thousand of your townsmen were there, that had this cheap edition of the Rights of Man
GARROW 11013 0 you not believe that of the cutlers alone, in the town of Shefficld, who had the cheap edition of the Rights of Man, there were many thousand 
GARROW 11015 I take for granted, that you having read that book, considered it very much as a sensible, well-written book 
GARROW 11017 Were you, or not, one of those who attended and passed resolutions, very properly approving of that book 
GARROW 11019 You mean, at the society, where it was read for information and instruction
GARROW 11021 Was it in the division meeting 
GARROW 11023 When a few friends met for constitutional information, you then read that book 
GARROW 11025 There werc ether cheap books furnished by the same subscription, were there not
GARROW 11027 Could you help us to the titles of any of them
GARROW 11029 "Do you recollect the proceedings at the Globe-tavern, in this town
GARROW 11031 At Chalk Farm 
GARROW 11033 At the Crown and Anchor
GARROW 11035 I hope you had all Paine’s works 
GARROW 11037 ‘Were you present at the meeting, when a public resolution was passed, expressing aprobation of Paine’s works
GARROW 11039 You will not venture to swear you were not 
GARROW 11041 If you had been there, you would not have been dissentient
GARROW 11043 You told me, just now, you agreed in thinkang a valuable work 
GARROW 11045 ‘hat do you take to be his notion, as to the use of monarchy in any state 
GARROW 11047 Upon your oath, do you not understand his book, the Rights of Man, to be a specific for getting rid of kings every where, not only as useless, but as burthensome and destructive to the rights of man 
EYRE 11049 You are not asked what you thought yourself, but whether Mr. Paine’s book did not propose it in that manner 
GARROW 11051 Upon your oath, did you not understand Paine’s works to be expressly written for the purpose of inculcating a notion, that monarchy was destructive to all civilized states, and that they could not too soon get rid of all kings
GARROW 11053 You did not understand it an approbation of his works
GARROW 11055 Then I take for granted, you entered a protest against that part that touched the monarchy 
GARROW 11057 I will read you a little of it: “ All hereditary government is in its nature tyranny. Do you happen to know that the monarchy in this country constituted a part of an hereaes government
GARROW 11059 And that Paine asserts tyranny to be interwoven in its very nature and existence 
GARROW 11061 “An heritable crown— you are politician enough—I am sure a much better one than I am—to know that the crown of Great Britain is an heritable crown 
GARROW 11063 I take it for granted, that the throne ef Great Britain is, in your judgment, an heritable throne 
GARROW 11065 Did you know that Paine says this: An heritable crown, or an heritable throne, or by what other fanciful name such things may bs called, have no other significant explanation, than that mankind are heritable property. To inherit a government is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds. This Passage was not expunged, I hope, in your cheap edition 
GARROW 11067 Was that passage fairly printed im your copy 
GARROW 11069 Now, after the account you have given of yourself, and your manner of studying politics, Task you upon your oath, do you believe, that that passage was not in your copy
GARROW 11071 Then you have no memory of what he says about heritable crowns and heritable thrones
EYRE 11073 You are pot asked whether you approved of that, or took that into your consideration, but whether it was in the book 
GARROW 11075 Was there any thing in Paine’s book that had for its object, to reconcile the people to the necessary expenses of their establishments and their government ; to make them contented under the weight of taxes that, to be sure, we must bear 
GARROW 11077 Tam asking respecting this book, which you have studied accurately and attentively; did it strike you that there were any passages in it, tending to reconcile the people to the necessary burthens of the state
GARROW 11079 Were there none that struck you to have a contrary tendency, to excite the people to be dissatisfied and discontented, and to think their burthens were unnecessary? — We thought it was our duty to apply to parlisment for redress. 
GARROW 11080 That is no answer; tell me whether you recollect this passage, and I am now reading out of the cheap edition: “ It is inhuman to talk of a million sterling a year, paid out of the public taxes of any country, for the support of any individual, whilst thousands, who are forced to contribute thereto, are pining with want, and struggling with misery. you recollect such a passage as this
GARROW 11082 You thought this a strong passage in f& vour of monarchy did you
GARROW 11084 You read this passage 
GARROW 11086 And having read it, be so good as to tell me whether you consider that as a recommendation ofthe continuance of monarchy, orits immediate destruction—how do you understand the passage 
GARROW 11088 T have already digelninned the intention to ask you any such question, because it is not fitto ask you whether you were a traitor, attend to my question—how did you understand the passage I have read to you, that“ monarchy would not have existed so many ages in the world, had it not been for the abuses it protects’? Did you understand that to be a recommendation, to the people of England, to protect and cultivate the monarchical principle, or to destroy it as soon as they could 
GARROW 11090 ‘ow did you understand the author to be advising when you read that
GARROW 11092 Upon your oath, do not you understand thepassage, and did not you, when you read it, understand it to be a recommendation to get rid of monarchy as svon as you could 
GARROW 11094 Did not you understand the author so to advise 
GARROW 11096 You understood that the object of a parliamentary reform was to be effected by petitioning, as that gentleman put it; if petitions of people in ditterent towns would not do, then there were to be petitions from delegates in aconvention. Did you expect your redress from parliament itself
GARROW 11098 Attend, then, to this passage in Mr. Paine's book, and tell me what you thought of that: —“ The bill, which the present Mr. Pitt brought into parliament, some years ago, to reform parliament, was on the same erroneous principle. The right of reform is in the nation, in its original character, and the constitutional method would be by a general convention, elected for the purpose, and so on. Now, having read this, as his account of a bill brought into parliamentto reform parliament ; and having stated that the nation itself, in its original character, was to do that, do you still adhere to it, that you expected it to be done by the House of Commons
GARROW 11100 You stated to that gentleman, that you grounded yourselves upon the glorivus advantages we obtained by the Revolution in 1683 ; you, doubtless, have read with attention Mr. Paine’s account of these advantages
GARROW 11102 You have, no doubt, read such a thing as the Bill of Rights 
GARROW 11104 "Vhere is no cutler in Sheffield, but has read that, and attended to Paine’s account of itWe bave attended to the Bill of Rights, 
GARROW 11105 Does he, in giving his account of this, call that Bill of Rights, a Bill of Wrongs and Insults 
GARROW 11107 Do not you know Paine so treats it in his Rights of Man
GARROW 11109 observe you made use of this expression more than once, in your answers to the learned gentleman’s questions, that you ever heard the society, as a body, propose to teuch the dignity of the House of Lords, nor as body, propose to interfere at all with the monarchy
GARROW 11111 Did you know Mr. Yorke
GARROW 11113 And have heard him, perhaps 
GARROW 11115 Did he use to attend at the mecting at Broomhead’s where the tribune was 
GARROW 11117 Were you a member of the secret committee 
GARROW 11119 Did you attend upon the Castle-bill when Yorke was there 
GARROW 11121 Am [right in supposing there was a motion made there for petitioning parliament 
GARROW 11123 What was the fate of that motion 
GARROW 11125 The motion for petitioning parliament was rejected, I believe 
GARROW 11127 How many votes were there for pctitioning parliament 
GARROW 11129 Upon your oath, was there a single hand but the hand of the mover and the seconder; I suppose all motions were seconded ? 
EYRE 11130 It was not seconded 
EYRE 11132 How were the votes taker
EYRE 11134 Were you present upon the other hill, at Sheffield, at the celebration of the fast 
EYRE 11136 You were one of the congregation 
EYRE 11138 How many thousands of you might be there that day 
EYRE 11140 You were one who joincd in all the ceremonies of that day 
EYRE 11142 When was it that your orderly and peaceable society, at Sheftield, first addressed the National Convention of France, as a national convention 
EYRE 11144 You never heard of'such a thing
EYRE 11146 You did not know that Sheffield had sent any address to France
EYRE 11148 Did you see the proceedings at the Castlehill, as printed afterwards with Mr. Yorke’s speech
EYRE 11150 They were pretty generally distributed at Sheffield 
EYRE 11152 I suppose you were not in the secret, that the motion to petition parliament was mude on purpose to be negatived; were you acquainted, before it was made, that there was to be such a motion made, ia order to n me it
EYRE 11154 That petition to the king, you speak of, was for the abolition of the slave trade
EYRE 11156 And enumerating a long list of grievances
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11163 I must object to this mode ; I shall be obliged to Mr. Erskine to ask his grace the duke of Richmond his question, without stating, by a preamble, why he asks it. 
EYRE 11164 You propose to call his grace, to ask him, whether this paper, now produced, is his letter to colonel Sharman; what has passed elsewhere with respect to it is nothing to the duke of Richmond. 
EYRE 11169 Then his grace may sit down, and cast his eye over it. 
EYRE 11170 Duke of Richmond
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11172 The better, and the more regular way will be, that the letter shown to the Sheffield witness, and which, he says, contained the plan that they looked to should be read, and then it should be examined by somebody with that now produced by the duke of Richmond. 
EYRE 11173 But whether it be exactly a true copy of the duke’s letter or no, it is that which they state they- acted upon. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11180 What is the evidence you propose to adduce? 
BOWER 11183 You are stating certain facts wae do not appear upon the evidence you Offer. 
BOWER 11185 You state that, in fact, to be a proceeding in partewoent upon certain peUtions, which I say is not opening the evidence, unless you find it there. 
EYRE 11187 I take it you are now going to open a motion in the House of Lords, which is upon the Journals. 
EYRE 11189 You may open the substance of that motion; and if you go beyond that, then their objection lies, that you have stated something which is not in the evidence. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11192 I do not ko what it is Mr. Erskine is now alluding to; but if he will state to me that it is a proceeting of the House of Lords of this kingdoa, which he conceives can be of use to a subjed of this kingdom, standing at that bar, letit be what it will, if it be a proceeding of be House of Lords, I will not object to it 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11225 I really must object to this sort of examination, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11227 Itis. 
EYRE 11284 Here the design is part of the overt-act; it is described as part of the overt-act. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11287 I rise in the first place to state to your lordships the objection which I have to the question that was addressed by my learned friend to the witness. 1 hoped that this objection had followed so immediately upon a conduct that I am persuaded betrayed, on my part, no wish to shut out any evidence that appeared to me to be admissible, that my learned friend would sincerely have given me credit, as he now states he does, for making this objection upon a ublic principle. I beg to say again, what I ; Lies had occasion to say befure in the course of this trial, that it belongs to every man in acourt of justice, as it dues to every man elsewhere, to be liable to error; it 1s not, therefore, with any confidence that I must be right, in the objection which I take, that I presume to trouble your lordships with this objection, but it is in consequence of an opinion that I am right; and if that be my serious opinion, recollecting that I stand here as prosecutor for the public, I am not at liberty, whatever my inclination might be, to sacrifice what appears to my own mind to be a great principle in judicature, adopted and acted upon for the benefit of the public, and, therefore, for the benefit of every individual who forms a part of it. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11288 When my learned friend stated that he had scen this objection brewing for some days, he will allow me to state to him what I do state upon my personal honour, if it be necessary for me to pledge that to him, that so far from brewing this objection, I do state, that I do not look forward enough into cases to anticipate such objections, for I protest I had not foreseen that such evidence as this would be offered, and had not considered it. But the learned and able manner in which my friend has reasoned upon it, I think of itself is some degree of testimony in support of what I am now saying, that it is an objection which, at least, had colour enough in it to invite the minds of two able counsel to apply their abilities to repel the objection, if it should be taken, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11289 Having stated thus much—what your lordbell has heard with respect to the case of Holt, and an expression which has fallen from my learned friend in discussing this objection I hope will prevent its appearing to those to whom I am now addressing myself, improper to make this observation upon it. When a motion was made for a new trial, because Mr. Justice Wilson was supposed to have rejected evidence which he ought to have admitted, my learned friend, in the discharge of the duty which he owed to his client, contended as strongly that that evidence was admissible, as day that this evidence is admissible; and I am perfectly persuaded that if any man had Jeft the court after he had heard my friend, he would have gone out of court with an opinion, which I hope my friend will not be too incautiously industrious in propagating, that there was a difference in the law of evidence, as it affected a newspaper printer at Newark, and as it affected other persons whose paper he proposed should be received in evidence. My lord, I say incautiously do it—and I think it my duty to say it, because when in the course of a trial affecting the life of the person who now stands at this bar, and not only affecting his life, but affecting the interest which every man in this country has in his e has done this us) 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11290 own life, and affecting every interest that aa be dear to him, I wish my learned nec would at once either decline talking of tk difference between a poor shoe-maker ai men of higher rank, or that he would su the facts upon which he thinks it fit to bed that sort of language. My lord, we livea a country in which the providence of the law, like the midenee ? God, is rer hs high and low, rich and poor; and speakny ior myself, I desire to be disgraced from ts moment, if in the course of this trial, either have conducted myself, or can conduct mrs in such a manner as not to do that justice & this prisoner which the law means should te done to him. 1 think I should be worthy oi that death, and ten such deaths as the pn soner must suffer, provided he is found guir upon this trial. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11291 Having said thus much, I proceed to su to your lordships that undoubtedly I ast that the questions with respect to the eft of evidence, and the admissibility of evidence, are perfectly distinct : for instance, if in te case of any person you find him at a tavert, speaking respectfully of the hereditary bility of the country, and of his majesty, 3 the situation and character which he holdst this country; and you find, on the olx hand, papers in which he holds perlecty different language upon other occasions; fact whether he held that conversation at ts! tavern or not, may or not be evidence ing to the circumstances under which th! conversation is held. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11292 In the case now before the Court, your lortships will recollect that it has been given 2 evidence that Mr. Tooke (one of the pers! whose name occurs in this indictment) at the Crown and Anchor, upon the 2nd of May, 1792, spoke with great respect of the hereditay nobility of the country, and spokealsowith rpectof the majesty of theking. Whyisthaterdence? clearly for this reason (without exam ing whether it would be evidence forany ob reason) namely, that it was a transactionof be two societies met in the course of the buss which they had been doing ; and it came ot also upon the cross-examination, which 6 another circumstance that will require 0 materially attended to. So with respect the prisoner at the bar—if, for instance, has been evidence given of the effect of ers, that the language which he ws fold was to be such language as pi would permit; — that be received psy which were not communicated to the sodely: and one private letter, in which a propos is stated, that monarchy is to be ripped UP by the roots; that in the answer to that it stated to those who held that conversst with him about monarchy—do not talk monarchy—do not talk about demo] —let your language be confined vod versal suffrage and annual parliaments all the rest of your objects will erg’ say there may be a great number of circumstances given in evidence, but then the question will follow, whether the decla‘ ration the man held is given under such circumstances at such time, and in the course of a conversation which makes that declaration evidence. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11293 Now with respect to lord George Gordon’s ease, if I recollect rightly, the principle upon which the declarations were received in evidence was this—that in that case the declarations were really a fact, for whatever declaration accompanies the transaction, whatever declaration is a part of the transaction that is done, is part of the fact that is doing, and upon that ground the declarations were admitted; it does not weaken the observation at all, that evidence was given in ’ that case, that lord George Gordon went to some magistrate, or some other person, whilst the mob was over-ruling tbe civil power of the country, for any conversation that was held by lord George Gordon duringthe existence of these riots, and with reference to them, he being a party in them, was t a declaration made at the time, and upon all the principles of evidence, was, therefore, connected with the transaction. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11294 With respect to the case stated last by my learned friend—Crohagan’s case, I take that to be as distinguishable from the present evidence upon the same principle, the object was to prove the view with which the man came into England ; he declared that he would Gome into England to kill the king; he did eome into England. Your lordship knows that hismaking the declaration, thoughit would be pimizhable in another way, yet still would not e high treason, if he had not come into England ; and, upon the whole of the evidence, the coming into England made a part of the transaction with the declaration he had made, it was an overt act of high treason, because it was then understood to be a fact done with the intention which the indictment imputed. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11295 My learned friend has said respecting Rosewell’s sermon, that no sermon can be high treason, I will not argue that, but I submit it is very dangerous to state that no sermion can be high treason. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11297 It is matter of good fortune then that I have stated it. No man in the world will suppose that I mean any thing else than what I am now saying ; —lIt does happen in the course of what counscl are stating, that they may conceive themselves to say what did not fall from them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11300 Then I can only say for myself what I am about to say for my learned friend, that it happens to those whose attention is called to the discussion of subjects, that words now and then which really fall from gentlemen do not strike the ear of those to Eon they are addressed, who ought to hear them; meaning at the same time to say distinctly that I did not hear them, but it is satisfaction sufficient to me that my friend permits they should be ut in. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11301 What is the evidence in the case of Rosewell, and many others to which my friend has alluded? In the first place he has not stated with respect to these trials who were the witnesses that were allowed to speak to these facts; he has not stated whether these circumstances were asked upon cross-examination; he has not stated whether witnesses were called to general character, and then gave in evidence these circumstances, in explanation of the general character which they had given; he has not stated whether the witnesses who spoke to these particular. declarations were speaking to declarations which did or did not pass in the course of the. very transaction which these witnesses were called to prove. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11302 Iam not meaning to contend in this case, that it may not be competent for my friend to state every word that Mr. Hardy ever said in the Corresponding Society—every word that Mr. Hardy said in his correspondence with every ater society; every word that he ever said in the Constitutional Society; every word which it can be shown upon the evidence proposed had a direct connexion, or which can be properly or fairly connected with the transaction now before the Court; but what I object to is this—that you should call a witness who was not a member of any of these societies, a witness who has already told the Court that he did know but little of Mr. Hardy, that he did not even know he was an associated member of that society, any connexion with which the Friends of the People had disavowed, and that you should be permitted to ask that witness, not this question, whether in the course of any transaction connected -with the subject now before the Court, Mr. Hardy made a declaration that could be considered asa part of that transaction, but that you should ask that witness what were the declarations of Mr. Hardy at any time, when he may have scen him without connexion with the subject which is the matter of the present indictment; this will lead a great way; it is not worth while to argue upon the effect of it, for that will go another way; but I wish my learned friends to consider a little if this evidence is let in for a prisoner, it will possibly lead to let in evidence against a prisoner. I am persuaded Ido not do injustice when I say that there may be cases, I will say nothing about the present case, because I ought not; but there may be cases in which, if this sort of evidence can be let in upon principle, it may furnish a principle upon which I may be obliged to offer that evidence which, according to my present opinions about evidence, 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11303 I have not thought myself at liberty to offer in this cause. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11304 I shall trouble your lordships for the purpose of stating the extent to which this principle may go; and your lordships cannot but be aware how extremely important it is to attend to the manner in which questions of this sort have been permitted to pass upon trials. They are often not attended to, they are often thought unimportant upon particular trials, and therefore not objected to; nothing can show that in a more striking light than the question which Mr. Erskine stated to have been put in Fitzharris’s case, “ whether the witness thought the act with which he was charged, was done with a treasonable intent,—which was the very question to be left to the jury. Now that question having been put withoutany objection to it, shows that in the course of trials of this nature, things are frequently passed over without objection which ought to be objected to, especially on the part of the crown, to whom itis constantly attributed, in all trials of this nature, that they are pressing the prisoner too far; that sort of odium being constantly attempted to be thrown upon every crown prosecution ; those who are employed by the crown are always extremely anxious not to raise objections, where they do not think that the general necessity of public justice requires that they should be raised. Now the objection here I believe, is raised simply upon the grounds of the general necessity of public justice; at least, as for myself, and with that view which I have conceived of the subject, I have been so far from objecting to questions being put, that I have sat silent till now during almost the whole of this trial; but it strikes me that the rules and principles of law, and especially the law of evidence in criminal matters, ought to be attended to with a very considerable degree of care and caution, for unless they are attended to, it is impossible to say to what length, upon the authority of what has passed in particular cases the matter may not be carried. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11305 I have conceived that a question which went to a particular fact, not relative to the charge of the very fact which was in mii never could in its nature be asked with a view to ny the truth of the particular charge; general character may be given in evidence, general conduct may be given in evidence, conduct being in effect part of character, but I never did conceive, that in any case whatever, if a man was trying for any act whatever, that you could give in evidence any particular acts that he had done at any particular time, under similar circumstances, and the question which is now attempted to be put, appears to me tobe of thatnature ; if this question can be put, why may not the prisoner at the bar, give In evidence every letter such he has ever written to any person whatever, upon litical subjects, in which he may have stated 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11306 ‘his own objects in any way in which bthought proper, and, perlvaps, with avs to this very prosecution; it strikes me, thi: this is considered, the danger of the adasion of such evidence is considerable, ai that it is contrary to all the principles uv which Courts have proceeded. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11307 If your lordships advert to the cases cts! by Mr. Erskine, and see the manner in wie he has stated them, I think your lonshy will find that, except as far as inadvertesi may have permitted questions to pass u noticed, they do not press very hard upon tt: case. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11308 With respect to the case of lord Ger Gordon, I have looked into it; having ue trial before me, it does not appear to meta! any one question was put with respect tott words of lord George Gordon at any tut, 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11309 1 which did not, in effect, form part of bisaduct in the very transaction which wa t question. Like the cry of a mob, for stance, in pulling down a house, the gener cry of a mob is given in evidence against it prisoner, because it was a part of the trusxtion at the time. es 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11310 With respect to the other cases, I think will be found that the questions have ral been upon the cross-examination of thness, and not upon any original exsminata on the part of the prisoner himself, for it purpose of showing by what he did at a time, what was probably his intention damanother thing at another time. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11312 I will then slitle advert to some of them: in Cornishsax , what wasit? He called several witness testify his loyalty, and that he drank tk King’s health ; does that warrant the questa which the learned counsel was going to pul Mr. Stuart with respect to Mr. bi a cular object in a particular thing? For thas the nature of the question hre was goingtop So in sir John Freind’s case, what are the questions that were put? When you hae been present in company, and they bave beet speaking upon the subject of goveramest what has he said or done? Why he us say, “ forbear, I do not admit of apy discourse ; that is evidence of his gem conduct with respect to the goveroment ol te country, and with respect to his veiw intentions as to that government; Mr. ton, I think, says, although you would a8 comply with what was proposed to yu, i you said you would never be concerned in plot. Now I think that that expression ma! have been upon a cross-examination, by 3 person who was called to give evidence plot
SOLICITORGENERAL 11314  . derstand it. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11315 dn which yoy have thought proper to conknowledge of law; I am not used to mayself, but I will not be taught by you or any be'concerned jn any such plot as was charged. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11316 proved, as clear as day-light, that he was concerned in a plot. And what a way this is of trying the guilt of 3 person, with respect to 9 particular fact, by bringing persons tg say, at at a particulay time he said he woujd no 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11317 Would ‘it be permitted upon a trial for murder, for instance, to give in evidence, that the prisoner said he would not commit a gnurder ; and yet as far as I have any conception of this, as stated by my Jearned friend, it was simply that evidence; and thereforeIthink it must have been upon a cross-examination. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11319 Then I do not understand. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11321 The manner, sir, in which you have thought proper to conduct yourself towards me, in the course of this trial has been such as reflects upon my character. I wil not submit to any map for talk of other person, propriety of conduct either ina civil or criminal case; I believe, I know myduty in both as well as you do; and I trust that I shall discharge it. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11322 y lords, the next that was mentioned was there? In order to show his general affection to government, it was asked, how has he behave at any general rejoicings? Is that any thing more than evidence of general deportment? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11323 ‘With respect to Rosewell’s case, itseems to me that that is in a great degree general deRest alhouph Y 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11324 that there was a degree of inaccuracy jn permitting the question to be put exactly as it was put ; but the question really tended simply to this, whether his general deportment was that of aman who was loyal and: attached to the government of the country? and nothing more. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11325 As for what my learned friend said with Yespect to a sermon being, or nat, treason; I think there wasa sermon which is mentioned in the history of our country, I mean the sermon preached by Dr. Shaw, at St. Paul’s Cross, for the purpose of exciting the people to 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11326 ‘rise against Edward the fifth, and put Richard 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11327 ‘the third upon the throne, which wasas clear an overt act of high treason as ever was committed. 1 mention this, because certainly the words which my learned friend has said he made usc of, did escape my ear, as well as the attorney general’s ; and, which shows that they did escape my ear, I do assure him that I have taken down, in the margin of my brief, that vey case of Dr. Shaw, which I then recollected, and that I could not have taken it down if I had conceived he had made use of the words which he says he made use of, and which I have no doubt he did, : 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11328 in that office, which my learned friend near me now holds, may not when it is produced as an authority against them, have it said that Mpon this trial (and a solemn one trust it will be) such and such things were admitted to be given jn evidence, and that therefore these reasons it 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11329 J must confess, that it} ikewise was a case in which I should think Under these circumstances, from the necessity that there is that in such a case as this a rule should be laid down which can be properly pursued—A rule which men may understand, and, calling upon your lordships attention that we objected sporting the prisoner’s general conduct; also to no questions releclaring that, for myself, in the view which ] 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11330 have of the case, I would rather have the question asked than not, yet for the sake of generyl justice, for the sake of what is to be one in future trials, and that other persons such evidence ought always to be given; for joes seem to me Important, that your lordships should lay down some rule upon the subject. 
BOWER 11331 Notwithstanding we are now not only in a criminal case, but ina case which affects the life of the prisoner at the bar, I make no apology at all for troublin our Lordships with the few observations have to offer, because I not only am conscious that neither myself, nor any one gentleman, with whom I am associated in this prosecution, can possibly conceive the purpose of pressing any evidence against the prisoner which we do not think is competent evidence, but I am confident that there does not exist acreature, about whose opinion I am anxious, that can conceive such a purpose to enter into the heart of any of us. 
BOWER 11332 My lords I conceive that this case, capital as itis, is to be tried upon the same principles of evidence as all other cases are; and it is our duty, as counsel for the prosecution, to resist the admission of any evidence which we think not competently legal, as much asif we were trying a common action of assault and battery, or as if a question could arise upon any subject that could possibly be -debated in acourt of justice, which imagination could conceive to be the most trifling. 
BOWER 11333 ‘Ihave always understood, that the declarations of parties are evidence only either in cases where they accompany the act at the time that they are made, or where they have been made at different times, and under different circumstances, totally unconnected with that fact, which is the question under discussion in the Court, in which cases they have always been received in the nature of facts, or rather as circumstances by which the general conduct of the party is to be judged of, as being circumstances, and being declarations given upon subjects to answer no particular purpose, and not connected with that which is the subject matter of discussion at the time that the evidence is given. 
BOWER 11334 Every case my friend, Mr. Erskine, bas cited, in my opinion, confirms the principle I am now stating; andif your lordship will examine them, one by one, you will find that in every case, which he has stated, where evidence of this kind has been received, it has been to show the general conduct and character of the prisoner, in circumstances and upon occasions no way connected with the crime of which he was then accused, but as circumstances and declarations in situations from which the jury might collect the general character and conduct oF the prisoner. 
BOWER 11335 It is indisputably true, that in the case of murder, evidence has always been received that the prisoner has at other times, upon other occasions, and in different circumstances shown acts of kindness to the deceased, and expressed himself kindly towards him, and they are offercd to show that that was the general disposition of the prisoner towards the deceased, from which the jury may collect that it could not be his intention to commit the crime which was imputed to him; but did any man alive ever hear it asked of a witness, produced in a case of that kind, whether he had heard the prisoner say, that he had No intention to kill the deceased ; and that that should be received as evidence, to explain the acts which were proved against the prisoner, upon the evidence given; and upon which the judgment of the Court and jury are to be drawn? 
BOWER 11336 In Holt’s case, which my learned friend has cited, in which he has admitted that the judgment of the Court of King’s-bench, went slong with the opinion of a learned, and most worthy judge, deceased—it appears that the judges were unanimous in thinking, when the fact was proved that the libel was published, that it was not competent to the defendant to explain his conduct, to state how, or in imitation of whom it was, that he had done that act which was then attributed to him as a crime. 
BOWER 11337 Inlord George Gordon’s case, the declarations there received, come under the other Principle, they were properly received, because all of them were declarations immediately preceding or following the act, so as to be considered as accompanying the acts of the moment—they were reccived upon the principle that declarations accompanying a fact, are a part of the fact itself; and that therefore you must receive them as circumstances of the fact; but there were neither received in evidence, nor offered, the private declarations made by that noble lord, previous to the time when he entered into that levying war, which constituted the crime of which he was accused. 
BOWER 11338 In the other case, which Mr. Erskine has stated, where the prisoner was permitted to ask what a person had heard him disclose ; that is on the principle of going to the general conduct—it was not with an intent to show that particular act, which is attributed as a crime in the prisoner, but to show that in former acts, which were considered as a part of bjs general conduct, the prisoner's disposition 
BOWER 11339 [tee was such and such upon certain subjects, nt connected immediately, not apologizing fr, and not offered as explanatory of the transactions which made the subject matter of the crime, with which he was ig ig 
BOWER 11340 In lord Russell’s case, when Dr. Borne was asked to a conversation of lord Russelfs against risings, which comes nearer than any my friend has stated, to the principle he wants to support—lIs it stated in that case, that my declaration lord Russell had made with respet to his intention, as to the rising in questea, or the facts that he was called to answer to was received as evidence—nothing like itwhen aman is charged with a particular rsing, which constitutes the particular fact o which he is accused, evidence of his genml conduct, and general character, d H of other facts, and other circumstancesare of fered to prove—not what he said respecting the fact there—but as general evidence of the conduct and intention of the party. 
BOWER 11341 As to Rosewell’s case, which was, that clergyman who had taken occasion to inst the government, had at other times preached sermons in favour of government, that coms within both principles ; the preaching a di course in favour of government at another time, is an act done strongly indicative of the intentions, and general conduct of the prisoner, to show that he was well disposed we wards povethiaent, and I give my learned friend leave, if he can in this instance, prove five hundred acts, to show that Mr. Hardy has always supported government, aot hasin his general conduct, done acts a3 D torious as the preaching of'a sermon in ap port of order, and good government. 
BOWER 11342 The case a sir ze Freind was of the same kind; the evidence was not to prow what he had done respecting the particur transaction, but to show that at differst times, when there could be no design in ve", the conversation not respecting the crime which he was then accused, sir John Freint had been speaking of government in the "J that a dutiful subject ought todo. 
BOWER 11343 In Dammaree's case, the declarations 1 ceived were directly accompanying the st: the declarations of the mob were received 35 part of the act, and upon that principle oaly. 
BOWER 11344 The case last alluded to was, I believe, Crhagan’s case, in which was given in evi against him, his declarations of coming England, to kill the king ; and his coming England coupled with other acts, to what his intention was; and there was declaration to explain the particujar act, which he at that time was accused, or which was then the subject matter of inquiry. 
BOWER 11345 ; I have before stated j om which 4 
BOWER 11346 learned friend Mr. Gi cently, and as he always does, very abl bl to expressious of good will, that is 14 which I do not deny, but the applicsto which I dispute, because I say that these & 
BOWER 11347 pressions of good will, are only received i the way that I have before stated, namely, that they are expressions at other times, upon occasions, when there is no crime imputed, when they cannot be possibly supposed to have relation to any crime, not then committed, or about to be committed, and which only shows a general good disposition— which in an equivocal act might make it doubtful, whether the party was actuated by malice toward the deceased, or not. 
BOWER 11348 But the evidence offered in this case, is of a very different complexion indecd, and such as I 
BOWER 11349 ly speak truly when I say I do not recollect ever to have been offered to a court of justice. The crime charged is, compassing the king’s death—we can give no evidence of the manner of compassing the death of the king, but by the overt acts which we have charged, and therefore the subsiance of the indictment is, that you did this overt act, from which this compassing necessarily arises; it is the act I admit to show the intent, which is just like any other fact, in any other case; it is just the same, as when we say a man committed a homicide with a felonious intent; the intent is a part of the crime—but was it ever asked, whether he had said he committed that crime, with a felonious intent
EYRE 11351 Mr. Erskine, I do not know whether you can be content to acseek in the opinion that we are inclined to form upon the subject, in which we go a certain way with you. Nothing is so clear as that all declarations which apply to facts, and even apply to the particular case that is charged, though the intent should make a part of that charge, are evidence against a prisoner and are not evidence for him, because the Presumption upon which declarations are evidence is, that no man would declare any thing against himself, unless it were true ; but that every man, if he was ina difficulty, or in the view to any difficulty, would make declarations for himself. Those declarations, if offered as evidence, would be offered, therefore, upon no ground which entitled them to credit. That isthe general rule. But if the question be,—as I really think it is in this case, which is my reason now for interposing, —ifthe question be, what was the politic speculative opinion which this manentertained touching a reform of parliament, I believe we all think that opinion may very well be learned and discovered by the conversations which he has held at any time, or in any place. 
EYRE 11363  You may put the question exactly as you propose; I confes! wished by interposing to avoid all discussiot, because I consider what we are doing, std whom we have at that bar, and in tht box, whoare suffering by every moment's th necessary delay in such a cause as this. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11370 If this had bea stated at first to be the question meant to askell, I do tot see what possible objectien 1 ¢guld have to it. Mr. Stuart, you bave before iad rejected oll correspondence Wit the Constititional 8d ciety 
EYRE 11375 What is this about. 
EYRE 11377  Recollecting what I do of the fact, I cannot concede that fact to you. 
EYRE 11381 Is it consented to on the part of the crown P 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11382 I object to it, and will state to your lordship why I do dbject to it. 
EYRE 11383 I should be unwilling to admit ‘it, if it were expressly consented to, because it would lead the jury from that which belongs to their considera tion, into a history with which we have nothing todo. The duke of Richmond’s plan ts connected with the evidence, and therefore it was proper to be prodiiced, because twenty witnesses have referred to that plan as the very grounds of their proceeding; but whether a set of gentlemen who assembled, called themselves by 8 particular name, or what passed in Scotland, or what passed in Treland ; for upon the same principle you may go to that, or to what ‘passed all over the world, for any thing I know, ‘but it entirely earties us from ‘the point, arid has in my opinion, to soft ef connexion with the case. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11395 After the petitions to parliament were rejected, your society has not met
EYRE 11398 What should I say to it if I should be of opinion that the associations of that year were high treason? 
EYRE 11400 One might be compelled, for aught I can tell, to say so. 
EYRE 11402 I do not impute it to them, I only say that nothing that was done by any set of men ten years ago, -or at apy other time, with welch these persons tl00 
EYRE 11403 had no connexion, and to which they have not in any manner referred, can possibly influence the present case ; we cannot ingui into that transaction, or say any thing it. 
EYRE 11415 It is not quite regular to go into a general narration, which nay inte luce a great deal of matter which will not be evidence ; the point you are called upon to prove is that Mr. Hardy, upon your conversing with him, offered to assist you in disclosing every thing he knew, and to assist you in bringing forward the inquiry, because asto his declaration beyond that it may not be evidence
EYRE 11417 e afterwards said that the object of the society was very much mis-stated, for that they had nothing in view but a parliamen teform according to the plan of the duke of Richmond. 
EYRE 11418 Not what his conduct was upon it—his opinion. 
EYRE 11422 The declaration of the object of the society, and how it was to be pursued, may be a very different thing.

ATTORNEYGENERAL 11451 Mr. Sheridan did, and I rather doubted whether that was from general recollection, or precise and accurate recollection. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11477  You have said that there was a remarkable readiness to have changed the prayer of the petition, if there had been time enuugh
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11479 Wad you any reason to believe (indeed I am almost ashamed to ask the question)—had you any reason to believe at the time that they waited upon you with this petition, that they had no anxiety at all about the success of it
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11481 I believe that was mentioned in the letter to you
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11483 Then in effect, as it struck your mind, they appeared extremely desirous that the petition should be presented, and were extremely willing that the prayer should be altered according to your ideas, if time would have permitted 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11485 They held the language then of men desirous to have a parliamentary reform to the extent the wisdom of parliamont it them, and not to use a language which amounted to a determination to accept of nothing less than universal suffrage and annual parliaments
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11487 I dare say they did not express to you their determination that they would accept nothin from the legislature but universal suffrage an annual parliaments 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11489 I think you said they had determined to print their letter of thanks to you
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11491 You told them you totally disapproved of the method of universal suffrage and annual representation
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11493 Did you happen to know that they had published what you desired should not be published, together with a pretty strong letter preceding, which I will show you

United as we ure upon the firmest and most patriotic principles, and with the purest of all possible intentions, the good of our country; it gives us the must heartfelt: satisfaction to see that those principles aud those intentions are pot confined to ourselves, but that there yet exists im the Units Senate a Patriot, who dares speak truth in the cause of his country, and plead for the people in the face of corruption. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11503 “ Too long has the cause of the people lay guished ; influence, interest, or prejudice have precluded knowledge from the senate; or not precluded, nearly overpowered. The people have seen with sorrow their happiness disregarded, and their rights undefended: the opposition of political warfare has been the effect of party, and the exertion of ability bsd interest for its stimulus. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11504 “ Roused from its torpor, the nation hasat last begun To THINK FOR ITsELF. Systems! communication have been formed, and me diums devised to collect the public voice— Mediums independent of influence, or comp tion: such is our society ; and from thatciety, you, Sir, are reise’ to accept the thanks of an obliged body of men, whith knows equally how to value its rights, a esteem the supporters of them. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11505 We have but to wish that from exertions able, so disinterested as your’s, the cause a the people may be impartially debated in pr liament ; and we trust when that is the ay, the distinction of party will cease, ands par liamentary reform take place upon the ground of equal right.

ATTORNEYGENERAL 11548 “Mr. Adams, Sir; Your favour of Srd ult. came duly to hand, the acceptance of our twelve friends as members of your's, is highly Satisfactory to this society, and I am directed by them ‘to request you will be pleased to present their sincere thanks to your society or their affectionate regard for, and honour couterred upon the members of this instituion. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11549 t is with pleasure we congratulate you on the rapid progress of real and useful knowledge, and the dissipation of ignorance and error from among the general inass of the people. Knowledge once obtained cannot be obliterated, but by the loss, orabuse of reason: truth once fairly discovered and substantiated cannot be defaced by the sophistry and wicked designs of artful and: crafty men. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11550 “We are happy to inform you that the number of our associating, or ticket, members, keep increasing, are now about 2,400, but they have not increased of late in proportion with our worthy and respectable Trends, who (altho’ they do not associate with us as an incorporate body) have manifested themselves in a way of respectability, adding strength and support to the undertakings of this society, and to the cause in general. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11551 “ On Saturday last, 19th inst. we received a packet of printed addresses, resolves, &c. from the society (Freemasons tavern) which, on mature consideration, we find ourselves not so well reconciled to the ideas they convey to us as we could wish, if they had appeared in a different point of view, nor do they afford us such a flattering prospect as we were apprehensive might be expected from an association of so respectable a body, under the high denomination of the Friends of the People. In our opinion, their answer of 12th inst. & your ictter of 27th ult. is no ways compatible with that appellation; from the known respeetability of many names which appear amonest them, we had entertained great hopes of their teal use in obtaining a thorough reform pon the principles of the Rights of Man, which can never be accomplished, until every mas enjoys his lawful and just privileges. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 11552 “ Previous to the reception of this packet, we did communicate to them, by letter, the leasing hopes it reflected to us, 00 lookieg jorward, viewing such respectable characters signalizing themselves in support of the people’s rights, agreeable to the above pra ciples, and the denomination by which they have entitled themselves, &c. In due course they would receive our letter last Thursday se’nnight, and in consequence we apprehend the packet was forwarded to us on the same day, but without any written communicatios: we shall not attempt any farther communica tion with them, until we are favoured with your sentiments upon the subject, or uott matters of doubt which we at present entertam, be, removed.

EYRE 11577 Is it very fair to allude to them? 
EYRE 11586 If you meanany thing that fell from the Court to that effect, rather think you misunderstood the Court. 
EYRE 11588 There was nothing said of those terms that I am aware of. 
EYRE 11590 Nor was it stated that these terms were used in that convention. 
EYRE 11740 Mr. Hardy, the counsel whom you have had assigned to you at your own request, have hitherto conducted your defence, examined your witnesses, and each of them has addressed himself to the jwry on your behalf: you are alco at full liberty to speak for yourself, if you wish to do so; and if you do, this is the proper time for you to be heard. 
EYRE 11872 Mr. Solicitor General, if you have finished this head on the Addresses to the National Conventivn of France, I think we had better adjourn ; as it will be impossible fur any human powers to sustain it, if we do not; and I think we should lose as much time to-morrow morning, as we should gain to-night. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11873 Gentlemen of the jury, When I had the honour of addressin: you last night, I stated to you the pa idea I had of the persons who were engaged in the transactions which have been brought in evidence before you, liow far in those transactions (though not specifically and precisely) how far I conceived the prisoner was generally implicated; what was his character in those transactions, and what were the characters of those who were the agents in them;protessing to consider, and to believe, that the vast majority of the persons engaged were not of that description of persons to whom the highly criminal intent imputed to the prisoner, ought to be imputed. I also stated to you what I conceived to be clearly the law upea the subject; hoping that, under the direction of my lords upon the bench, you will be of opinion that what I have stated as the law, is 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11874 Twesdex, liberty ; and that they had declared, in theSaeetaly the law of the land, derived down to us now for-a period of between four and five hundred years. Having proceeded then to state to you what appeared to be, from the evidence, as far as 1 went through it, the views, objects, and intentions of the persons concerned in these transactions, I had arrived at that period when the societies addressed the National Convention of France, aud I had insisted considerably at large upon that transaction. I had insisted upon it, because it appeared to me to be a transaction which showed their views, their intentions, and their objects so plainly, so clearly, and so irrefragably, that 1 thought it impossible, in any part of the case, more strongly to impress upon your minds what those views, what those intentions, and what those objects were, and how they meant finally to accomplish those views, intentions and objects, namely, by assembling a National Convention. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11875 I think, gentlemen, if you advert simply and only to those two Addresses; to that introduction to one of them when it was presented to the National Convention by Mr. Barlow and Mr. Frost, and to the answer which was given by the president of the National Convention—an answey in which no fraud or disguise was necessary to be used, and in which, on the contrary, the plain truth was most likely to appear—you can have no doubt in your own minds that the views, the objects, and the intentions of the prisoner at the bar, and of all those who were so far concerned with him as to have a complete conmexion with that transaction, were nothing less than the destruction of the government of this country, by means of an assembly of the people, and to establish a representative government in the room of that government under which this country has so long floufished, in spite of all the abuses that belong to it. Abuses will belong to every government, perhaps aboininable abuses belong to this government—I will not dissemble that there may be such; and as far asin my power, I should think it my duty to bring them forth whenever it should be necessary to do so, for whatever situation a man may stand in in the country, he bas an interest infinitely dearer than that situation. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11876 Gentlemen, having stated to you what apted to me to be a reasunable conclusion tom the transaction with France, which I have mentioned, I will notice to you the observations which naturally occur from the cunduct of those who were concerned in it: and I must here observe, that as it has been extremicly difficult in the course of this long drial, to mark with certainty all the papers that have been produced, I may by possibility, but I am sure it will be unintentionally, menUon to you some papers which may not have becn actually produced. If I should do so, I should be much obliged to the counsel for the prisoner if they can correct me. If not, Iwish my friends to do so. Twas going to state to you a letter from the society at Stockport to the prisoner, dated the Srd of November, 1792. gentlemen, ou will recollect that with respect to all the el that have been produced, except, I think, one, not a single observation has been made by the counsel for the prisoner. That one is a letter from Norwich, which I shall Notice to you presently. In this letter of the 3rd of November, 1792, the secretary of the society at Stockport, says, “ I am directed by the Friends of Universal Peace and the Rights of Man, which very title I think, if you advert to it, plainly shows what the intention and object of these parties were; for you will recollect (the thought occurs to me at the moment) that the idea which had been conceived by those persons, was an enthusiasm unquestionably, but an enthusiasm dangerous in the highest degree; the idea which they had conceived was, that by the establishment of the Rights of Man, universal peace would be established throughout the world. When, therefore, persons assuine the appellation of the Friends of Universal Peace and the Rights of Man, they plainly declare that they have Not in view any reform in the government of this country, as now established, because it is, according to their declaration, inconsistent not only ah their conception of the Rights of Man, but with their conception of the procuring universal peace. Their idea of the means of procuring universal peace was, that by establishing a representative government throughout the world, the interests of the people would be so immediately considered y the government of every country, that war would cease, and universal peace would be established throughout the universe, and all the world would be, in effect, one nation, You will recollect that that has appeared in a variety of instances in the papers which have been produced to you. Thatenthusiasm they certainly had, and an enthusiasin as dangerous to government as any that ever existed; as dangerous as the enthusiasm of the millenarians, or Fifth Monarchy-men, who in the last century occasioned some disturbance, not very violent, indeed, in this country, under an impression upon their minds that Christ was to come to establish his own government upon earth, and that there was to be universal peace and good-will among men ; what they called the kingdom of the saints. Under that impression they made an insurrection in the reign of Charles the second, which was suppressed after the death of a few people. There had been an insurrection of the same nature under the government of Cromwell, which also was soon suppressed; but the persons concerned in these transactions, to the very last persisted in their enthusiasm, and soine of those executed in the reign of Charles 2nd, protested in their last moments, that if they had been deceived, they had been deceived by heaven. When the minds of men are capable of being worked up to such blasphemous expressions, it is not possible to say to what length they may not go. Their sincerely entertaining such ideas, does not at all lessen the danger of them; does not at all lessen the necessity for the government of the country to take the means of repressing them, and punishing the delinquents in the severest manner. If men should take it into their heads that the community of goods is part of the christian religion, and should upon that ground take the goods of their neighbours, they must be punished as robbers, because it is impossible to preserve the peace of society by any other means. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11877 Gentlemen, I have digressed in consequence of what occurred to me from the title which! these people at Stackport chuse to assume. The letter proceeds—“ I am directed by the Friends of Universal Peace and the Rights of, Man, to inform you, that we received two! letters trom you; the first, dated September 21st, requesting us to concert with you in transmitting to the French National Convention an address signed by every member
SOLICITORGENERAL 11879 The letter proceeds— with respect tu the substance of this letter, we believe that the cause of the French is that of every individual person in Europe, that is not fattening on plunder, or who, through ignorance, obstinacy and inattention, sit unconcerned, and will not be persuaded to consider, although inevitable ruin should be the awful consequence
SOLICITORGENERAL 11881 men and free citizens; and that our heart are united with theirs, as in one comma cause, considering, as in a great meas, their victory our emancipation, togetier with their own. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11882 Now, what was that victory 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11884 Gentlemen, observe the manner in which this letter proceeds— “ Yes, should it ever be the case that our ministry should be so per dious, as contrary to their pee faith of neutrality, to join the execrable band of dee pots against the cause of freedom, we wil stand forward, even to the hazarding our lives, by using every justifiable means a counteract their machinations, and give to the friends of freedom all the encouragement and support which-we severally, unsupported, can afford, ; 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11885 Gentlemen, is not that a clear and plain de claration—is not that saying, without a doubt, that considering the cause oft the French as thelr own cause—considering the victories of the French as their own victories ; considering emancipation of the French as theirownemalcipation, theywere eager themselvesto to the extinction of what they call treacheroes royalty and so to restore toevery individual his equal and indubitable rights, as free meD free citizens; and thatthey would do this tothe hazarding of their lives: Tt seems 10, that it is impossible to conceive a more com plete comment upon those addresses to the National Convention, than that which is com tained in this letter
SOLICITORGENERAL 11887 But, gentlemen, what is the letter Norwich, which my learned friends oie descend to observe upon—TI supposs be 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11888  . selection which in perbaps, they found, tp take notice of something, and without any very clear view, I should apprehend, in the have le of it; unless, that, in the course of the evidence, there was very considerable allusion to it, and therefore they thought it could not possibly escape notice
SOLICITORGENERAL 11890 November the 11th, 1792
SOLICITORGENERAL 11892 It states, “ We, the Society for Political Information at Norwich, are desirous of holding, and strenuously supporting, the noble sentiments, which you (the London Corresponding Society) “ so lately and friendly dispersed among us; and, as we so much admire your well-adapted plan for a reformation in the state, permit us, with the utmost deference to your worthy society, to participate with you in all your great national correspondence, which your very name promises to maintain ; and in consequence thereof, it is humbly desired by the society which I have the happiness to represent, to incorporate three members with yeur worthy fraternity; in doing which, I shall here inform you of their names and residence : then the three persons are mentioned—“ Our principal design in doing this, is, that we may have an opportunity of knowing more exactly, what may be thought the most eligible steps to be taken in carrying on this great business of our associated brethren, and to have an opportunity to ask such sort of questions as may be thought very reasonable among the brethren, especially when we think that publications are covered with a sort of obscurity in them, as the Sheffield people’s declaration, which seems determined to support the duke of Richmond’s plan only, 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11893 Now there, gentlemen, is a society which Perceives a sort of obscurity in the declarations uf the Sheffield society, and states in what it conceives that obscurity to consist, “ especially when we think that publications are covered with a sort of obscurity in them, as the Sheffield pevple’s declaration, which seems determined to support the duke of Richmond’s plan only. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11894 Gentlemen, you will recollect that the plan of the duke of Richmond was a plan: which, however I may think it wild and extravagant, wasa pan which had no other object whatever than that of reforming the House of Commons in this country, by making all persons who were of a certain age, and not liable to certain objections, capable of giving their Votes for the election of members of that House, dividing the whole country into districts for that purpose, and allotting, I think, about 2,600 votes to the election of every member, and making the members about 500. So that it had not, in any degree whatever, in view, the giving what is called the right of active citizenship? that is the right of every man to share in the government of the country; but expressly confining in his letters, and in all his declarations upon the subject, his idea of reform, to giving to every man the right of choosing a person by whom the laws by which he was to be governed, were to be made —a distinction very clear-and very plain, but not very easily to be found in that declaration of the Sheffield people
SOLICITORGENERAL 11896 The letter proceeds, after observing that the Friends of the people and the Society for Constitutional Information did not agrce— “ We would be glad to know the reason; it seems to me as though the difference was this: the Friends of the People mean only 4 partial reform, because they leave out words expressing the duke of Richmond's plan, and talk only of a reform; while the Manchester people s¢em to intimate, by addressing Mr. Paine, as though they were intent upon republican principles only. We are accused of pressing hard upon the prisoner for addressing Paine. Did not this Norwich Society, with whom he corresponded, consider that, by addressing Paine, the Manchester people seemed to intimate that they were intent upon republican principles only ? And did not the Friends of the People put the same construction upon the conduct of the Society for Constitutional Information. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11897 The letter proceeds —“ Now, to come closer to the main question, it is only desired to know whether the generality of the societies mean to rest satisfied with the duke’s plan only’—conceiving therefore, as you see. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11898 Gentlemen, that the least that they were to vein view, was establishing the duke’s plan —‘ Whether the generality of the societies mean to rest satisfied with the duke’s plan only ; that is, whether you struggle for more, or will be contented with that; for that must be the meaning of the words— or whether it is their private design to rip up monarchy by the roots, and plant democracy in its stead. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11899 Gentlemen, when we attend to this letter, ais impossible not to perceive that this Norwich Society was floating in a degree of uncertainty with respect to the views of the other societies, was disposed, perhaps, to be content with the duke of Richmond’s plan only, to rest satisfied with it, but at the same time to obtain whatever it could beyond it. That this letter was written for the purpose for which it was supposed by the London Corresponding Society to have been written, for the purpose of knowing what were the true and real sentiments of this London Corresponding Society. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11900 Now, gentlemen, if the London Corresponding Society had intended to hold sacred the House of Lords, and had no object in view but establishing a new constitution of the monarchy of the country, to hold sacred the House of Commons, by universal suffrage and annual parliaments, would they have hesitated in answering this letter? would they, as described in Lynam’s evidence (and by the way I would observe that Lynam’s evidence throughout is capable of being contradicted by hundreds and Gapdreds of persons, if it be Not true, and there is not one person brought to contradict one single word of it), would they have deliberated in the manner in which he describes them to have deliberated upon the subject? would they have thought that this letter was intended: to draw them into some incautious declaration, and that in conequerce they might be brought into some difficulties? what incautious declaration could they have been drawn into by this letter, if they had meant what it is now pretended they did mean? Their answer in that case would have been, “ You have totally mistaken us; we have not the most distant idea of what you suppose, of ripping up monarchy by the roots, and placing democracy in its Stead; our view is simply and only a reform of the House of Commons upon the duke of 's plan. The answer to the letter was the most simple and plain imaginable, it never could have been matter for deliberatia and consideration. They would have treated this letter as a letter not to draw them i, except it was to draw them in to do thz which they did not mean to do, and asa letter which ought, therefore, to be rejected with the utmost indignation. But what do they do? they deliberate upon this letter, whichis dated the 11th of November, and at on the 26th of November, they send this aswer—it was addressed, first of all, “ Gentle men, but that is scratched out, and “ Fell Citizens put in its place. Observations have been made upon the word citizen. U! tionably we are all citizens of the same sta, and when the word citizen is used without any particular allusion, it certainly means notbmg in any degree improper; but what is the comment which they themselves have gives upon the word citizen, in the report of ther committee of constitution? They distinguish between citizen and subject—“ citizen, the ancient appellation given to the members of free states—subject can only, with propriety, be applied to a member of a state whose go vernment has been instituted by foreign con uest, or by the prevalence of a domestic action. Thus they have constantly, if you will recollect, in all their papers, intimated the most gross falshood—that the British constitution was a government instituted by foreign conquest; meaning, as Mr. Paine thinks proper to assert most falsely, that the constitution and government of this country was the result of the Norman conquest, whereas, in truth, all the alteration that that comagiteak introduced, was an alteration pra cipally in the aristocratical part of the constitution, and those must recollect who know any thing of the history of the country, that the Saxon es and institutions are the whole foundation of our government, particularly that part of it which vonsiats in the admins tration of justice, which is the great security of the liberty of the subjectThercfore, gentlemen, the word “ citizen is not an ndifferent word when used by these persoss: it would be indifferent used by others, but when used by persons who draw a distinction between citizen and subject, and who assert that no persons are to be called subjects bet those who are members of a state whose co vernment has been instituted by foreign conquest, or the prevalence of a domestic factica, which they call an usurped government, they mean to assert that they are determined no longer to remain subjects of the British co vernment, but to be fellow citizens of a new state. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11901 Gentlemen, the letter having in its adcres the alteration from “ gentlemen to “ Fellow Citizens, proceeds thus—“ Your letter of the 11th instant, was by the secretary laid behre the Committee of Delegates of the London 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11902 Corresponding Society; the London Corres-}| They proceed, gentlemen, to say, “ they ponding Society having never before heard of your society, wish to have some further information concerning it, as to its origin, its principles, and the number of its members. h an account in your next letter will give them great satisfaction. Here, gentlemen, they are writing to a society of whom they profess not before to have heard; of whom, therefore, they ought certainly to have been particularly cautious, because they could not possibly know any thing of that which they here inquire after, the principles of its embers. The letter proceeds—“ They do not tho‘ roughly comprehend how it would be possible to incorporate with our society, three of your members residing in Norwich, inasmuch as it would be impossible to communicate to them at that distance all our correspondence, ‘and they could not attend our committees, where the business is transacted. If it is information you want, they will very readily -alswer- any question you may put to them. As to the object they have in view, they refer you to their addresses. I shall take notice -of these addresses presently, of which my learned friend reminds me that the counsel for the prisoner have taken no notice whatever; not one single observation has been made upon those ardresses, though those adare here expressly referred to, as containing the objects the society had in view. “ As to the objects they have in view, theyTefer you to their addresses; you will therein " see they mean to disseminate political knowledge, and thereby engage the judicious part of the nation to demand a restoration of their “rights in annual parliaments. The members ot those parliaments, owing their election to the unbought and nnhiiassed suffrage of every citizen in possession of his reason, and not incapacitated by crimes, they consider the obtaining such parliaments to be the indwork of every necessary reform. To this, therefore, they steadily adhere, and turn themselves neither to the right, nor to the left, to follow any other plan whatever. The rules and orders of their society being so plain and easy, that if they can get a majority of the nation to act as they do, the proposed reform will effect itself. They look upon the trifling differences that may have arisen between the several societies to be of very little consequence, and think they will subside without any ways injuring the cause. Those trifling differences consisted, as stated to them by the Norwich Society, in the question, whether the societies meant to rest sa-tisfied with the duke of Richmond's plan only; or, as the Friends of the People proposed, still less violent measures ; or whether it was their private design to rip up monarchy by the roots, and place democracy in its stead. These are the phe! differences ; and I observe that this word riffing is put in the place of the word little. It, therefore, Was hot a word that was not considered. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11903 think it a matter of small importance what. ever name you choose to adopt; they advise you to follow their plan, and divide yourselves Into small societies, each of which to choose a delegate; the delegates when met to form the committee, and transact the business of the society ; afterwards let each delegate sapere to his division the business so done, let him admit fresh members, communicate fresh intelligence, promote and encourage political discussion, or read to you such books as may convey the instruction your weaker members stand in need of. Weak brethren, you will recollect is a term that was very much in use at one time; it meant a person that was not risen to that height of enthusiasm which was necessary for what was then called the good cause— but above all, and then the word “ gentlemen, is struck out—“ but above all be careful to preserve peace and good order among you; let nu dispute be carried to excess. And here come the words which show the meaning of the whole of this letter—The question put to them was, whether it was their private design to rip up monarchy by the roots, and place democracy in its stead; see what answer they give to that. Instead of expressing their indignation at such an idea: instead of saying, how could you imagine that such was our intention: how could you conceive that we had ever thought of destroying that which is so essential to the established constitution of this country, which is indeed the very essence of its government ; the essence of the government of this country being that it is a monarchy; a limited monarchy; the great use of that monarchy being that it reduces action to a single point, it suppresses ambition, it contains every thing within a just prerogative, and it gives us this boast, that we never need fear a Robespierre, or any dictator, because we have a king; because we have a person at the head of all, to whose situation no person can aspire, but whose powers are so limited by known and bounded prerogatives, that he cannot pass beyond them without exciting the jealousy of all? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11904 “Gentlemen, the answer is very curious ; it is—“ Let no dispute be carried to excess; leave monarchy, democracy, and even religion entirely aside; never dispute on these topics. What! never dispute on the topics of monarchy and democracy! on the propriety of establishing the one or the other as the government of a country, when persons were considering what ought to be the reform to be created in the governmont of the country ! “ Let your endeavours go to increase the number of those who wish fora full and equal representation of the people, and Icave toa parliament so chosen to form plans for remedying the existing abuses. Should they then not answer your expectations, at the year's end, you may choose others in their stead. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11905 Now, gentlemen, this letter which chooses to leave monarchy and democracy entirely alone, in effect states a plan of clear and pure democracy ; for it says— let your endeavours go to increase the number of those who wish for a full and equal representation of the people, and leave toa parliament so chosen —that is an entire parliament, so chosen by a full and equal representation of the people— an elective senate —for it can mean nothing else— to form plans for remedying the existing abuses. Should they then not answer your expectations, at the year’s end you may choose others in their stead
SOLICITORGENERAL 11907 Gentlemen, you have been told that the prisoner never talked of the abolition of meonarchy—never talked of the abolition of the peerage—of the establishment of democracy—but all his language was only of the duke of Richmond’s plan
SOLICITORGENERAL 11909 (te the number of those who wished for a fil and equal representation of the people, cording to sense in which he used the words; and “ leaving to a parliament so cwniente accomplish every object that wis! a The letter proceeds—“ The committee oa you every assistance in their power, bi request that your questions may relate chid: to the methods of obtaining a reform in pe liament. Still observing the same sortconduct; do not put to us any such awkwar questions, as whether we mean to be coskat with the duke of Richmond’s plan only, whether it is our private design to npmonarchy by the roots, and place demon in its stead—those are awkward questicts; we don’t like to write answers to such que tions, but request your guesses may reise chiefly to the methods of obtaining a reforw in parliament. The letter concludes, “ Lic yourselves we are friends to peace, notauarcr, and well wishers to the Rights of Man, s¢ not so sanguine in our expectations, 3s imagine those rights will be restored by ue spontaneous consent of those who have 2 long deprived mankind of them. Gentlemen, you will observe that the lett: from the Norwich Society, to which this letter is an answer, concludes—“ I shall say more at present, but remain a friend to peac, not to anarchy, a well wisher to the Rights o Man, when obtained by consent. The a swer to it says, “ The London Corresponding Society, are also friends to peace, not anarchy, and well wishers to the RightsMan, yet not so sanguine in their expect tions, as to imagine those rights will b restored by the spontaneous consent of thove who have so long deprived mankind of then. Thus they expressly declare that their ness are not of the peaceable description of thee of the Norwich Boclety that they look tos degree, at least, of force; to taking the & vernment of the country, from those to whem it has been intrusted, against their const; and to ne it b ae mpauses epee selves shall provide for the purpose. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11910 Gentlemen, this, and numberless other letters of the same description, which I might observe upon, clearly and distinctly, as it seems to me, show the principles, the views, and the intentions of the persons who are engaged in this transaction ; and the means by which they meant finally to accomplish those intentions. I think that we may fairly judge of the views and intentions, and even of the principles of a man, not only by what he himself declares, but by the principles of the company he keeps; by the principles of those whose character, and whose acts he approves, by the principles of his publications, I am told I am not to judge of men by their opinions but by their actions, I answer, I must frequently judge of the object of their actions by their opinions. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11911 Suppose the Roman Catholics, in the reign of king Willlam, had set about a reform of religion, and for that purpose had attempted to assemble a convention, to act as a convention of the people, for the reform of religion. Could you have had a doubt what sort of a reform they meant to effect? Could you have had a doubt that they meant to establish Popery ? Would a doubt of it have existed in the mind of any man? And one great reason why you could not have had a doubt of it, would be, the intolerant principles of Popery, though perhaps not of the Roman Catholic religion, for I know they make a great distinction, and a distinction in some degree well founded, between Papists and Roman Catholics; but the great majority of Roman Catholics in England, at least in former times, were Papists, if they are not so now. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11912 Gentlemen, when we advert to the papers which have been laid before you, we must observe the same spirit of intolerance in these societies. The French at this moment are as intolerant in their political principles as the Papists ever were in their religious principles. They willnot endure any other sort of government to exist in the world, but their ownform of government, because they say that the government which the light of reason discovers to man, ought to prevail all over the world, and therefore they are in conscience bound to promote it. Thus they hold the same obligation upon conscience in matters of politics, as the Papists deemed bindin, upon conscience in matters of religion, an which men hold to be binding in matters of religion, because they think they ought toendeavour to prevail upon other men to take those means for their final happiness, which they themselves think the right means. This is a natural impression upon the mind of man; but applying that Feinciple to government is perfectly new, and dangerous to the highest degree; as it tends to the unsettling of eve state whatever, because no two persons “il agree upon the question, which. is the must proper form of government? No two persons perhaps ever perfectly agreed upon the subJect—and if persons by doen certain principles, and act upon the persuasion, that those Principles are so clearly the result of the light of reason, that they ought to be established throughout the world, and that it is highly meritorious to establish them throughout the world, they act upon a principle of intolerance which is just as great, and just as dangerous as that of the Papists. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11913 If therefore men, who in the years 1793, and 1794, professed to consider no government as lawful, but that which is established on what they call the indefeasible Rights of Man, as taught by the French, by Paine, and by Barlow; and who professed to admire every thing done in France—the extermination of treacherous royalty, aud all hereditary distinction, and the confiscation of property ; if such men show a desire to fraternize with persons of the same disposition; if such men proceed to declare their intention to reform the government of Great Britain, and take steps for that purpose; and especially if the steps they take are, endeavouring to assemble a convention, which should act in the character of a convention of the people, can any thing but the destruction of the British government be their end? Is it possible to imagine, that they had any other object? For if they should once have it in their power to effect any reform, can they, upon their own principles stop short of that reform, which they declare can alone constitute a lawful government? It is not in the nature of things gentlemer. If men once get the power to make a reform, and lay it down as a principle that the only just rule in forming a government, is establishing the indefeasible and imprescriptible Rights of Man, with all their consequences, the necessary result is, that the moment they have the power in their hands, they will do the whole. It is impossible to doubt it. But it is not simply opinions, which the Sean and those who were combined with im have declared. They are not simply opinions ; they are resolutions—resolutions to act upon opinions. The societies, by their addresses to the French Convention, have declared, not only their opinion that the government of this country ought to be republican —not only their wish to make the government of this country republican—but a resolution to take measures to effect it. They resolve to make the government of this country republican—and? having so done, they in effect declare, that they have entered into a complete conspiracy against the government of the country. For when men entertain opinions ; when these opinions are followed by a wish to carry them into effect, and a resolution to attempt to accomplish that wish, they form a conspiracy to do what they sowish to bedone, Ido not know what is a conspiracy, if that is not one. And these men have declared, not only that such are their opinions, that such is their wish, that such is their resolution, but they have declared how they mean to accomplish that resolution ; namely, by means of a convention of the people; and to establish within this country, that sort of government which would enable the French National Convention to address a National Convention in England, not as a constituent assembly, simply, but as the governing power of this country. Gentlemen, this has been the construction which has been put upon acts combined with opinions in other cases, What was the case of Crohagan, which was mentioned by one of my learned friends? A man declared his opinion that the king ought to be killed; he declared his wish to effect it; he declared his resolution to effect it, if he could come at the king. This he declared in Spain; and having done so, he came to England. What was the interpretation which a jury put upon all this ? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11914 That he came to England for the purpose of effecting that resolution which he had previously made; namely, a resolution to kill the king if he could come at him; andInever heard the propriety of that decision of the jury, in any degree reprobated; on the con , it is always stated as an illustration of aprinciple. But if he had declared, not only, that he had formed the resolution to kill the king, but that he inittended to do it bya ah ge instrument, aud if he afterwards ad provided that very instrument, how strongly would the providing that instrument have declared his purpose, and especially if the instrument was of a particular construction, and such as is not ordinarily used ? You would say, immediately, there could not be a possibility of doubt of his purpose. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11915 Now let us see how this Corresponding Society, and those who leagued with theinn—I mean always the leading members—proceeded to carry into execution, that purpose which it seems to me they had clearly and expressly demonstrated in these addresses to the National Convention of France, and in the addresses of the London Corresponding Society, to the people of England, which I shall presently mention, and in the letters which I have observed upon. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11916 Gentlemen, this is necessarily a deduction of some length—but why is it so? because in the nature of the thing, a resolution of this kind could not be carried into effect in a moment. The only means by which it could be effected was, by raising up a strong party in this country to assist the conspirators in 0; ia the completion of their intent. The Revolution which has taken place in France, peat from very small beginnings, to the eight at which it has arrived. If we trace it from its source, we shall find so much similarity between what has happened there, and the nature of the attempt made in this country, so far as they have gone, that I think we shall perceive that the difference in the events has arisen from difference in circumstances, The ancient government of France had become so odious to all ranks of the people, that the opinion of the people, by which alone a government can be supported, failing all at once, the whole fabric fell together, almost without a struggle; and it was obvious to every one, that the meeting of the states-general, in the year 1789, must produce a total change ia the government of the country for this plain reason, that the opinions of a vast majority of the people were changed, with Tespect to the Propriety of their existing government; and whenever that shall be the case in any country, the government of that country cannot stand. The government of Great Britain, on the contrary, has long been the object of affection. We are in the habit of considering, that it has produced, during a long course of years, great public good. e view it with all its faults, with all its imperfections ; but in the result, wishing, as all of ere ee us may honestly and probably do wish, togive it as much of perfection as we can; and though we are sorry to see many of the abuses which prevail in it, yet we view it with a great degreeof attachment, and of reverence. e may be told, perhaps, gentlemen, and so we have been told by writers upon this subject, that all this is prejudice—prejudice! Gentlemen! What are the opinions that we form, upon the greatest number of subjects, but such as may be deemed prejudices? Is the mind of any man capable of reflecting, in all its extent, upon every thing which comes before its view. We are obliged, necessarily, to take a great deal from the instruction of others ; and that alone makes the important difference between men of education, aud men of no education. For education is, ina great degree, the instilling what, in this powt of view, may be considered as prejudices into the minds of men. It is giving them the benefit of the opinions of others; teaching them, in early life, to rest satisfied with the deductions which have brought the minds of other men to certain points; to take them as data, as principles, upon which they will p ceed to reason, and to act, in their future Men of great leisure, who have the opportanity of contemplating subjects with more mnuteness, who are not engaged in busines which any way distracts their attention, may speculate upon various subjects, which generality of men, in the busy world, cannot possibly find leisure to contemplate, whateret their situation in life may be. And a grest majority of the people in every country, let the nature of its government be what it msy, must necessarily be so much employed in ob taining the ordinary comforts of life, that it is impossible for them to employ’ upon many subjects, with any very good ef fect. This sort of fous it is that mio ences the minds of the generality of the people, with respect to the government of country
SOLICITORGENERAL 11918 ; prejudice of public opinion—and the first atarr) 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11919 (Parry tempt to destroy a government must necessarily be, to destroy that prejudice of public opinion in its favour, which is its support. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11920 he first operation of those who conspired the destruction of the ancient government of France, was unquestionably to destroy it in ; the public opinion; and that was completely effected befure the meeting of the states-general, in 1789. Having done this, they had removed every thing which ma retseil the go-Vernment, and it necessarily fell. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11921 Gentlemen, those who have imitated the proceedings of the French, in this country, ; and imitators, I call them, not because they make use of such a word as convention, " jmitators, I call them, not because they talk of organizing, and appoint committees, for Various purposes, suc as are made use of in 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11922 “ the French Assembly, but because they haveproceeded directly upon the plan which has succeeded in France, in overturning the established government; . they have proceeded upon the plan, which not only destroyed the government which existed previous to the year 1789, but which has also destroyed that 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11923 “ constitution established in 1791, which wasthe Most popular constitution, in its form, that ever was established in any country, with a king at the head, and indeed more popular than any constitution that ever was establishedin any country whatever. For the king of the French, as he was called, under that constitation, had, in effect, very little authority, except that most extravagant revenues unquestionably were assigned him, and some particular prerogatives were given him, which probably were intended, by those who framed the constitution, to enable him to assume, again, a certain degree of power, which they might conceive to necessary for keeping the whole together, and preventing the mass from tumbling to pieces. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11924 Gentlemen, Mr. Paine was fully aware of the effect of all this. He tells you, in his ig affection for this country, that, during e American war, he had it in contemplation, having transferred all his love for his native country to America, and declared himself acitizen of the world; an expression which tends to destroy all those attachments which unite ustogether; a man who becomes what he calls a citizen of the world, becomes, in a certain degree, an enemy to his own country, acting contrary to all those natural attachments which unite us to the society in which we have been educated, and which have hitherto been conceived as the best affections of man, and which the principles of these men lead directly to destroy
SOLICITORGENERAL 11926 This he mentions in a note, which shows what was, in his mind, the consequence of ttacking the public opinion upon the government of a country. He opens the introduction to the Second Part of the Rights of Man, with observing, that, what Archimedes said of the mechanical powers may be applied to reason and liberty : “ Had we a place to stand upon, we might raise the world. He conceived, that the propagation of his principles was that standing P ¢, by means of which he hoped to raise the world. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11927 Gentlemen, you will observe, that an imPression was made on the minds of all these men, that what had passed in France, in the course of the years 1789, 1790, and 1791, was 8 prelude only to that which afterwards would follow, long before the 10th of August, 1792 ; and that the 10th of August, 1792, was the glorious victory which completed their triumph. They considered the world as in a course: of revolutions; and, in the phrase of Mr. Paine, that revolutions were the order of the day. The impression upon the minds of these men, that the world was in a course of revolutions, and that revolutions were the order of the day, appears throughout almost all their papers. You will find, upon examination, that they considered a revolution as inevitable ; as that to which the nation must finally come. They have been likewise taught that the danger to which alone this sort of revolutionary principle was liable (for so Paine teaches them), was, the revolution being attempted, before the principles upon which revolutions ought to eee, and the advantages to result from them, were sufficiently seen and understood. Therefore, the object of the works of Mr. Paine, Mr. Barlow, and other publications of that description, was, to show to the people of this country, the principles upon which revolutions ought to proceed, and the advantages to result from them, in order that these being sufficiently seen and understood, the rest might follow. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11928 Gentlemen, for this purpuse a variety of pamphlets have been published, which have been observed upon to you. These pamphlets have clearly and unquestionably for their object, to destroy the opinion which the people generally have of the excellence of the British constitution, in all its parts, but more especially in those two parts which the counsel for the prisoner have said, it was the object of the prisoner to retain. For these books consider a House of Commons as a thing tolerable only in comparison with a House of Lords; anda monarchy they consider as utterly destructive of all principle. That there is something like principle ina House of Commons, but nothing like it in the other two. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11929 Gentlemen, if the persons who were engaged inthis did not mean to destroy this government, why should they endeavour to destroy the public opinion with respect to it? If they meant to reform it, why should they declare that no constitution existed? How could they reform that ‘which did not exist? The very declaration that there was no lawful constitution existing in the country, was a declaration, that whatever they might like in the present constitution, they meant to adopt as part of a new establishment, and not as part of the old establishment. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11930 Gentlemen, the ease with which men are induced to imagine that things are wrong in the state, has often been observed upon ; it has been said by an aneient and venerable writer of our own country, that “He that goeth about to persuade a multitude they are Not so well governed as they ought to be, shall never want attentive and favourable hearers ; fos they know the manifold defects to which every kind of regimen is subject ; but the secret lets and difficulties, which, in all public proceedings, are innumerable and inevitable, they have not ordinarily the judgment toconsider
SOLICITORGENERAL 11932 But, for the purpose of a systematic attack upon the government of the country, it was necessary that there should be some leader, some head, to direct the whole. Gentlemen, what has been the wonderful effect of the societies which have been established in France; I mean the Jacobin club, with its forty-four thousand affiliated popular societies, which, fora great length of time, really governed France, and kept it in continual agitation 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11934 the person whose name aj 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11935 One society, principally made use of for these purposes, was the Society for Constitutional Information, with respect to which, this observation may be made: It was a soci originally consisting of gentlemen of respectable characters, and in lependent principles —Some of them, perhaps, were soured by dis content ; and might carry their discontent ts great lengths; but they were men who wer not likely to answer the puposes of the per. sons who are the objects of the charge pow before you. Thete were likewise who got into this club, from time to time, and began to use such language, and to condect themselves in such a manner, that, yeu will find, almost all the original members of the club deserted it; and at last, as you will recollect from the proceedings of the society which were read to you, about sixteen or se venteen persons, appear to have been the whole of the members who regularly attended, frequently only five, six, or seven were present; and the business was often transacted with a great degree of inattention, There were seldom more than sixteen or seventeen present ; and if we advert to the persons present upon the important transactions, we shall find that a very few indeed, guided and directed that club
SOLICITORGENERAL 11937 You will easily perceive that such a society as this, was not that sort of society which could be made to operate as a Jacobin club; because a society of this description was net an open society, it could not, from the natere of its constitution, be made a popular society. But people looked to the character which the Society for Constitutional Information had long had in the country ; for the world in general did not know that their old res members bad declined attending the society. —WMr. Sheridan said, I think, that he had not attended at the society for eight or ten years. —As that, however, wasa thing not genetally known to the world, the proceedings of the Constitutional Society, signed by tbe se. cretary, had with the world the ty of the names of all those persons whe had been members of the society
SOLICITORGENERAL 11939 The consequence of this has been, that the prisoner at the bar has stood as the clear leader in all these transactions. By header, aay pears com forward in all the Gannichons, and he is involved therefore in all. He became afterwards, by association, a member of the Society for Constitutional Information. oo Gentlemen, the plan and constitusiom of this London Corresponding Society was admirably calculated for the effect which it was intended to have. Its name imports that the object of it was, to correspond with all other societies of the like description; and an imnportant object of this society was, to unite, by means of that correspondence, all the country societies with this society in London, and with the Society for Constitutional Intormation; so that they might move in one bond of union, in the manner recommended by that letter which I have mentioned to you. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11940 This society was extremely popular in its constitution. Any body might be admitted a member of it, of any description. The sums collected from the members were very small, They were formed into divisions; and when the members amounted to a certain number, they were to be divided again, for the purpose of diffusing their meetings more generally over the whole town
SOLICITORGENERAL 11942 and that committee of correspondence finally became the Conmittce of Secrecy, which I before observed upon. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11943 This society have, in three publications which they have given to the world, and which the gentlemen on the other side have notin any degree observed upon, declared their principles and vbjects, so far as they Ahought it proper and sate to declare them. You will recollect the manner in which they expressed themselves in the answer to the Norwich letter; and I must beg you will always have in view the answer to that Norwich letter. It is akey to all their language. It directs the Norwich Societies to leave monarchy and democracy, and all disputes upon that subject alone; but to look forward to one distinct object—the obtaining a fulland equal representation of the people in parliament, leaving to a parliament s0 chosen, to carry into execution the rest of their views, ifthey should not be able immediately to carry them into execution. Their intention, therefore, was, to keep as much as possible out of their publications, any thing about monarchy or democracy ; but, at the same time, tu express themselves in such a manuer as should convey completely, to those who chose to understand them, all that they meant. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11944 The first address of the London Corresponding Society was dated the 2nd of April, 1792, but which the evidence has clearly shown you, was concerted between the prisoner and some other persons, ata much earlier period. It begins thus—“ Assured that man, individual man, may justly claim liberty as his birthright we naturally conclude, that, as a member of society, it becomes his indispensable duty to Preserve inviolate that liberty, for the benefit of his fellow citizens, and of his and their posterity
SOLICITORGENERAL 11946 You will recollect, that, throughout every one of their papers, they have uniformly declared, that they considered the existing government of this country as an usurpation, and as an oppression
SOLICITORGENERAL 11948 Then they resolve expressly, “ That every individual has a right to share in the government of that suciety of which he is a member
SOLICITORGENERAL 11950 4akh 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11951 —“ That the people of Great Britain are not effectually represented in parliament.’—And then they say, hat, in consequence of a partial, unequal, and therefore inadequate representation, together with the corrupt method in which representatives are elected, oppressive taxes, unjust laws, restrictions of liberty, and wasting of the public money, have ensued
SOLICITORGENERAL 11953 These resolutions, thercfure, when attended to and attcnded to purticularly with the comment which they themselves make upon them in their letters, and other proceedings, amount to a clear resolution, “ That every individual has a right to a share in the government of the country; —meaning a share in the election of those persons by whom that government is to be administered, legislative and executive ; and the fourth, sixth, and seventh resolutions, taken together, clearly show that they meant to have a wholly elective parliament. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11954 Gentlemen, their second address was published on the 24th of May, 1792: and in that address they state the sort of test, as it has been called, which they proposed to administer to every member, upon his admission. Now, the only ground upon which tests of any kind can possibly be supported is, that, in the administration of the government of a country, it is necessary, for the safety of that government, that the persons who compose the actugl administration of the government, should not be adverse to the principles upon which that government is formed : That isthe only ground, as it strikes me, upon which any test whatever can be supported. — But a test in a society which was to have for its object the fair discussion of the principles of government, seems the most extraordinary thing imaginable
SOLICITORGENERAL 11956 The questions to be put to the membersbefore their admission, and to which they are to answer in the affirmative, are, “ First,— Are you convinced that the parliamentary meprescnialion of this country is at presentin-adequate and imperfect? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11957 “Secondly, are you thoroughly persuaded that the welfare of these kingdoms requires , that every person of adult years, in possession of his reason, and not incapacitated by crimes, should have a vote for a member of parliament? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11958 “ Thirdly, will you endeavour, by all justifable means, to promote such reformation in parliament ? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11959 Here, gentlemen, they bind, at once, all their members to one certain object, aud using all justifiable means; justifiable, you will observe, gentlemen, is a very lar word—“ all justifiable means to promote sua a reformation in parliament.—Is it, the, to be conceived, that the persons who became members of this society—I mean those who were the leading and directing members of 2 —meant that there should be, in any conve tion which they might assemble of the pecple, a full and fair. discussion of the subjet— that the present existing constitution of the country, in all, or any of its parts, should be tried in a fair deliberation—that the will aad wishes of the people should be taker yxa the subject 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11961 The report of their committee of consti tion states exactly the same resolution, wit this variation only, that the words, “ the wh fare of these kingdoms, are omitted: Why these words were omitted I think it is ox very difficult to discover, when one recollecs that in one of the letters which was from some society in the country, andwas afterwards published, the word kingems was altered for country, in two difierest places. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11962 Gentlemen, it is also clear, from that repot of the committee of constitution, to have just referred, that the persons composed this society, were fully aware, thi the opinions of a great majority of the pe ple of the country were not with For one of their resolutions is, that 0 majority, however great, can justly ce the minority of any part of their rights. Whenever it is attempted, the 3 bond is broken, and the minority havea right to resist —and this, is eae inky ae : of any part of their civilrights. en Hen, HE o. these civil rights? W y the fourth resolution is this, “ The civil rights every individual, are equality of voice 0 making of laws, and in the choice of the po sons by whom those laws are to be adminis 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11963 There they have expressly told you what they mean by the right of every individual to 4 shure in the government of that society of whi he isa member. It is not simply an equally of voice in making laws, but likewise in th choice of persons by whom those laws are to ke administered
SOLICITORGENERAL 11965 -7 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11966 be administered; that every person has a right to exercise these rights, thatno majority, however great, can justly deprive the minority of any part of these rights, and that, whereever it is attempted, the social bond is broken, and the minority have a right to resist. I do not wonder that my learned friends did not make any observation upon this paper—It is impossible to make any effectual observation upon it, for the benefit of the prisoner, because the meaning is clear and plain, beyond the possibility of doubt. Here are persons declaring a principle so wild, that if it were to prevail, it would be impossible for any government to exist—It has generally been conceived, that it is a very strong thing to say that the majority have a right to alter the constitution of a government, at least without very strong necessity for it. A num‘ber of people are assembled in a country, whose whole habits, and connexions, lead them to wish to remain in that country, and they are assembled upon certain terms of association, which forms their constitution. Every individual has a sort of sacred right to the observance of the terms of that association; a right, at least as sacred as his right to the property which he possesses.—If it be his wish to continue to live under that constitution, it is injuring him as materially and as essentially to take away that constitution of government, as to take away his property. Undoubtedly cases of necessity may arise, in which that right must ‘be invaded, as rights of property, and every other right must be invaded, in cases of necessity—even the right which every man has to his own life—you must remember the case which is commonly put, of two men being upon a plank in the sea, and the plank proves capable of supporting only one of them. It is said, that the stronger would be justified perhaps in the “ I confess, gentlemen, waa overcome with the dreadful alternative to which that man must be reduced—It is commonly observed, that it would be justifiable for the stronger, in that situation, to push the weaker from the plank, for his own preservation. But, gentlemen, if we feel so much when a man is reduced to such a dreadful situation, and feel that nothing but absolute necessity can justify the act which he does—what can justify men, who without a very strong necessity, shall attempt to disturb the established poverrunentt of any country, in which any large proportion of the in retain the government so established 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11968 without extreme necessity — but asserting that no majority, however great, can justly deprive the minority, of any part of their civil tights; that whenever it is attempted, the social bond is broken, and the minority have a right to resist; and assuming at the same time, as one of those civil rights, the right of equality of voice in the making of laws, and in the choice of persons by whom those laws are to be administered? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11969 Is not this a declaration, clear and plain, that they conceive they have an unquestionable right to resist any government which is not a republican government, founded upon their principles of universal representation ; and that any other government is so unlawful that they are not only not bound to give it support, but that they have a right to resist it to the utmost of their power, and in any manner in which they think fit to resist it? this is a principle which teaches rebellion against every government not founded upon their plan, and yet told that men who hold such principles, who come to solemn resolutions upon them, are men who have a perfect reverence for the monarchy of this country, for the hereditary peerage, for every part of the government of the country, except the corrupt representation in the House of Commons. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11970 Gentlemen, the address of this society of the 6th of August, 1792, proceeds exactly upon the same principles; and when you consider these addresses and resolutions in the report of the committee of constitution, I think you cannot have a doubt in your own minds that every thing which tends the other way in any part of their publications, is what the attorney general represented it to be, a mere veil to cover their designs; but so thin, so thread-bare, and so tattered, that the naked limb is starting outevery moment. This address of the 6th of August 1792, begins with those lines from Thompson which my learned friend read so well. Who will dispute any one principle which it contains? and yet, if passages are to be taken from books, and applied to such purposes, the best books may be perverted to the worst of purses. No book has been more perverted to Pad purposes than the bible. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11971 This address of the Corresponding Society to the inhabitants of Great Britain, on the subject of a parliamentary reform, begins thus— Uninfluenced by party pique, or selfish motives, no ways affrighted at the frowns of power—not in the least awed by the evidently hostile preparations of much alarmed aristocracy.’—Here conveying, for the first time, that idea which you afterwards see developed with-so much success, and which was to end in arming their own bars yon will observe the idea is here completely developed—“ not in the least axed by the hostile preparations of a much alarmed aristocracy—we, the London 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11972 Corresponding Society, united with a view of obtaining a thorough parliamentary reform, anxiously demand your serious and most collected attention, to the present vitiated state of the British government. We entreat you to examine coolly, and impartially, the numerous abuses that prevail therein, their destructive consequences on the poor, and their evil tendency on all: as also the rapidity with which these abuses increase both in number and magnitude. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11973 Gentlemen, I think you will observe, that in all the addresses, and in all the papers of these societies, there has been a great attempt to excite the poor to be of their side ; to interest the poor in their tavour, and to represent the poor as the great objects of their attention; to bold out, that their wishes were principally for the relief of the poor—Mr. Paine’s works, have many passages to this effect; and in Various other parts of this cause you must have observed the suggestion of the same ideas. In one of the letters which I shall byand-by observe upon (a letter of Margarot’s) the distinction is drawn for the very same purpose, between the poor and the rich— where he says “the rich are arming, why should not the poor do the same ? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11974 This address of the Corresponding Society, having urged the various abuses, prevailing in the British government, proceeds; “ we next submit to your examination, an effectual mode of putting a stop to them, and of thereby restoring to our no less boasted than imPaired constitution, its pristine vigour and purity ; and we thereuntg warmly solicit the Junction of your efforts with ours. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11975 “ This great end, however, we believe attainable solely by the whole nation, deeply impressed with a sense of its wrongs, uniting, and as it were with one voice demanding, of those 10 whom for a while it has entrusted its sovereignty, a restoration of annually elected parliaments, unbiassed, and unbought elections, and an egual representation of the whule body of the people. You will recollect that these are words frequently made use of— words which admit of different interpretation. But gentlemen, it strikes me that this very address contains completely that interpretation which the society themselves meant should be put upon the words, 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11976 Having proceeded to state the situation of the different persons of this country, and especially the poor, they say, “ Such being the forlorn situation of three fourths of the nation how are Britons to obtain information ant redress?Will the Court — will ministry aftord either 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11978 Gentlemen, you will observe how this is echoed back in all the letters from the country societies. For men, who use such expressions, to state, that they are men who have it in their view to obtain, from the existing legislature of the country, that alteration an the constitution which they propose, seems to me to be perfectly absurd. I would observe too, here, upon one part of this address, where it notices proclamations; because ut has been urged, by the counsel for the priso ner, that, those who have been engaged in these transactions, were never made aware that they were acting improperly. Why, gentlemen, in that jamation which is bere Noticed, and in a variety of other acts of vernment, it was clearly and expliciuy clared to them, that they were (&king steps which might lead to the most dangerous consequences. It was pointed out to them, that those who had the direction of government, conceived that the safety of the state was in danger; that there was a conspiracy formed to subvert the constitution of the country; that a reform in the representaticn of parks ment was 4 mere pretence; and that the object of the conspirators went infinitely beyond that. This they were distinctly told, over and over again, in a variety of ways. Even the various associations, as they term them, of the rich, showed that the rich apprehended the same danger? that they conceived there was an intention to make that sort of alters tion ia the constitution of the government which must be subversive of its principles, and destructive to their rights of property. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11979 Under these circumstances, oughta society, who had only in view a reforin in parliament, by clear and specific regulations, applying merely to the House of Commons, ought they to have expressed themselves in such lap guage? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11980 They proceed : “ The only resource then, friends and fellow citizens, will be found m those societies, which, instituted with a view to the public good, promote a general instruc tion of our rights as men, expose the abuses of those in power, and point out the only com Stitutional, the only effectual means of for warding a public investigation, and obtaining acom plete redress for a people, in whose credulous good nature originated their preseat difficulties. Clearly and directly pointing to that convention, which has since been attempted to be established. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11981 Gentlemen, this address likewise pointsout the very same thing which is noticed in the answer to the Norwich letter which indeed refers to thisaddress. The address says,“ Yet, fellow citizens! numerous as our grievances, andclose rivetted as weighty the shackles on our eedom, reform one alone, and the others will all disappear. If we once regain ar annually elected parliament, and that parliament to be fairly fie by all, the people will again share in the government of their country, and thet then unbought, unbiassed euffrages must ut doubtedly select a majority of honest members. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11982 Gentlemen, the answer (you will obeerve) to the Norwich letter, says,—‘ Leave Momerchy, Democracy, and even Religion entirely aside; never dispute on these topics ; let endeavours go to increase the number of who wish for a full and equal representation of the people, and leave to a parliament so chosen, to form plans for remedying the existing abuees. The letter, therelDre’ to the Norwich Society, commenting on this Address, shows you what they meant. It shows you, that they meant, in their words, to leave Mo. narchy and Democracy alone; but to hold out that. which they thought, under the cover of language, they mi y hold out ; and, at the same time, keeping clearly in view the destruction of Monarchy, and the establishment of Democracy, of which you cannot possibly have a shadow of doubt, when you consider the terms of that letter, the terms of this address, and the particular passages which Thave read from the report of the committee of constitution. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11983 Gentlemen, there are two things contained in this address, which struck me in a very extraordinary manner. One is, the description of what they conceived such a parliament (an elected parliament) as they describe, would do, when assembled. They say, that such a parliament, “ Finding that a most extruordinary waste of public money had taken place under the different pretences of places, Pensions, contracts, armaments, subsidies, secret service money, exc. our honest and atinual parliament would, after narrowly scrutinizing the same, retrench every sum needlessly or wickedly laid out. You will observe, this passage refers to a waste of public money, which Aad taken place, and says, this elected parliament would retrench every sum needlessly or wickedly laid out—not that it would prevenit, in future, improper expenses. Gentlemen, I leave to you to make the comMent upon that passage. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11984 The other passage which particularly struck me, is also a passage which speaks for itself, and which I take to he exactly of the same description as that which I last mentioned. — he people’s parliament finding, that, under Varlous pretences, grants of common land had been obtained by sundry persons, no ways to the benefit of the community, but very much to the distress of the pour, the same would be s00n restored to the public, and the robbed peasant again enabled annually to supply his disfamily with an increased quantity of bread, out of the profit arising from the liberty regained, of grazing a cow, two or three Sheep, ora brood of geese thereon. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11985 What can that possibly mean, but that all those commons, which, under the gencral cousentof persons interested, under the authority of acts of parliament, or in any other Manner, have been enclosed, improved, and divided, should, under pretence of restoring the rights of the poor, be taken from the present proprietors, and divided amongst those poor, for the perpese of engaging them in the Party? If it be possible to give any other con“truction to that paragraph, I wish you to do ts but my mind is incapable of giving it any other construction, and I think there cannot be an idea more destructive to private property. For under the same pretence, the whole property in land of every person in the country, might be destroyed. I cannot form a calculation of the immense quantity of land, which, within even the last twenty years, was common land, and is now become separate and enclosed, ee the faith of which inclosures, persons have laid out large sums of Money in improvements and bui! dings; and, generally speaking, those who had rights of common, had their rightscompensated in some way or other. Whatever injustice may have been, in particular instances (supposing any such to have been), if once an attempt is made to unsettle rights gained in such a manner, and so established, all right of property is necessarily in danger. If you once attack the principles on hick rights of property have been established, you must go on till you will destroy all right of property, and do exactly what has been done in France. For there, under the pretence of the rights of the public, an immense quantity of property, which had been granted, from a vast distance of time, by the crown, to individuals—as half the estates in this country are, perhaps, held under grants from the crown, although, perhaps, those pant cannot be actually traced—was taken tom the possessors, and given to the publie. The first French National Assembly, that Constituting Assembly which acted in many cases very properly, was guilly of the gross injustice of taking into the hands of the public, large quantities of land, from great numbers of persons, which had been purchased and acquired in various ways, because they said, the lands had been originally improperly granted. —Here the expression is, “ improper grants land which may easily be applied to lands formerly granted by the crown, and indeed to the title of every person’s estate. This lure is held out, unquestionably, for the purpose of gaining the poorer sort of people. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11986 These are two striking passages in this address
SOLICITORGENERAL 11988 Gentlemen, you will also recollect, that, if what Lynam stated upon that subject is untrue, there could have been no difliculty whatever in contradicting bim; and, therefore, whatever reflections may be thrown upon him, or upon spies, or any other persons, you must believe that to be true; because, when a person is accused of having concurred in a transaction, by evidence, which is capable of being contradicted by a great number of persons, and not one of them is called to contradict that evidence, you must give credit necessarily to the accusation; and its not being contradicted, when it might be so easily contradicted, if false, gives it a confirmation beyond all doubt. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11989 This address statcs, that, ‘“‘ Numerous other reforms would undoubtedly take place, even in the first session of a parliament, so elected, dependent only on their electors, the people, untorn therefore by faction, undivided by party, uncorrupted by ministry, and uninfluenced but by the public good
SOLICITORGENERAL 11991 It is a remarkable thing in the history of the constitution of this country, that the time when the liberties of the country were most in danger, from the over-bearing influence of the crown, was immediately after the close of the civil wars between the Houses of York and Lancaster, when almost all the great families in the country had been extinguished by the accidents attending those wars; many falling in the field, and on the scaffold, and many being ruined by confiscations; so that, according to my recollection, when Henry 7th ascended the throne, there remained only about thirty peers in the parliament. And he, wisely, seeing the advantage which this accident gave him, scarcely added at all to the number of peers, the consequence of which was, that there was not that middle body to stand between the crown and the people, and all the dangerous exercise of power, every thing which Ted to that which was afterwards done by Charles ist, will be found to have originated in the government of Henry 7th, aud bis son Henry 8th, whilst the peerage of the country was in that situation, that, from the number of the members of which it was composed, they did not form that barrier which it was intended they should orm. ‘ 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11992 Gentlemen, I have now, at a length to which I certainly did not intend to go, com mented upon the establishment of the London Corresponding Society, upon its addresses, and upon its constitution ; and it seems to me, that this alone would be very sufficient to show, that the object and the intention, that the formed resolution fer I think we do it injustice when we call it intention, o opinion, or conception), that the formed ravlution of these societies, that is, of the leadng members of them, was, to establish, in ths country, a democratical form of government; a form of government more democratical than that which ever existed in any other counuy —unless we conceive that it exists now i France—utterly incompatible with, and therfore necessarily destroying, the monarchal part of our government; and therefore, als, a clear demonstration of a tonspiracy depose the king; and any act, taken in pr suance of that conspiracy, is unquestionably an act of high treason. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11993 Gentlemen, in the course of these transrtions, there was one very artful proceeding; which was, I believe, ohserved upon by the attorney general. The society for Corstte tional Information met every Friday; the delegates of the Corresponding Society me every Thursday. The advantage was, tx Society for Constitutional Information were to hold themselves up as persons of reset: able situations; all violent resolutions wer therefore to begin, either in the country 9cieties, or in Scotland, or they were to in the London Corresponding Society— committee of delegates of the London Caresponding Society, came to resolutions 0 the Thursday, which, on-the Friday, they generally communicated to the Society , Constitutional Information. And here another strong'proof, how perivetly aristocrabt the government of this democratical soaely was. For a measure was to be resolved up2. first, by their secret committee ; then to the committee of delegates, andupon there; which committee of delesies necessarily acted, in a certain degree, bhodly upon the reports of the committee of com pondence, because they did mot know all hecorrespondence that passed ; being adoptthere, they were not to wait for an adophod of it’ by the rest of the members of te society ; it was to be reported, indeed, athe different division meeti but that might not have happened till the resolution| taken place; because. those division were upon the different days, which were mast convenient for the different divisions to me and yet, on the Friday, without any referee to the division meetings, the resolutions to be carried to the Constitutional Society, athe proceedings of the London Co Society. wa 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11994 Gentlemen, that letter from Sheffield, oe I before adverted to, I now see is dale 15th of October, 1792; from the editer 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11995 Patriot ; and there, speaking of the establishment of several socicties, it says—“ We beg leave also to throw in our mite of commendation, of the laudable spirit which you have evinced in your intention to address the National Convention of France, and ho sincerely, that your example will be followed by all the societies in the two kingdoms; Ireland having already set the example— then it says ‘ we hope your society will also give them (a particular society, which is named, the Stockport Society) “ your sanction, advice, and support; as it will be in vain for 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11996 ’ the friends of reform, to contend with the tremendous host of enemies they have to encounter,—clearly showing, that they considered that avery large propurtion indeed (and some of the other letters expressly stating, that a vast majority) of the people, were against them. It goes on—“ We clearly foresee, that Scotland will soon take the lead of this country—(I wish you, gentlemen, to observe this) “ and conceive it will be necessary to take the greatest care, that an universal communication should be constantly kept up, between the several societies, however distant, and that all should determine to act upon the same principle, and move together, as near as may be in regular and activeunison. ’Twas by this method, France becume so thoroughly united, and we ought never to lose sight of it. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11997 Now, can any government subsist, which has within its bosom a number of societies acting as a corporate body upon those principles? What, gentlemen, 18 a government, anda state, but a corporation 
SOLICITORGENERAL 11999 Ompany, for instance, is a corporation, by means of which our possessions in the East Indies, to a certain degree, are governed. That is a corporation, acting in subordination to the great corporation of this country; which, lord Coke says, is composed of King, Lords, and Commons, of which the King is thehead. He calls it, expressly, the great Corporation of this country. Then here, upon the principle of incorporation, are a great Humber o! societies, united together, for the Purpose of moving together in regular active unison ; for the purpose of furming themselves Into one state, which should act together, upon one principle; a sort of combination of states, like the United States of America, which still have one regular constitution, which regulates the whole government. A country may bear a corporation or state within it, which is in avowed subordination to it, such as the different corporations in this kingdom ; because it has a power to regulate their actions by the proceedings of the courts of justice. If the exceed their power in any degree, it calls them in question, and they may, if they go to certain lengths, forfeit the privileges granted to them. Such corporations are completely within the power of the government, and are capable of existing consistently with the safety of it. But such corporations as these, cannot exist in any government, with safety to that government. It is, imperium in imperio, which is inconsistent with any government. This was the very principle upon which the National Assembly in France, in 1791, passed a decree against the Jacobin clubs, which unfortunately for that country, was never put in execution. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12000 We object to these socicties, “ you are acting as a corporation—you are taking upon yourselves the firmness, union, and manner of acting, which belongs to a corporate}bady, which makes you therefore a state within a state, and renders the existence of your society, totally incompatible with public peace. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12001 The celebrated specch made by one of the most distinguished members of the French constituent assembly, Mons. D’Andre, a man of considerable ability, states this in so clear and plain a light, that it must bring conviction to the mind of every man, that the government of a country cannot exist, if there subsist within it, such a set of associated and affiliated societies, acting as a corporate body, in opposition to that government, in the manner in which these socicties proposed to do. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12002 In all these transactions, the prisoner unquestionably has borne a very distinguished part; and you will find that his letters, if you take the trouble of referring to them, certainly show his privity with every part of the transaction. A privity which must necessatily also be inferred from his situation of secretary, with every part of the transactions. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12003 Gentlemen, you recollect a letter of the prisoner, to Mr. Vaughan, of the 9th of April, 1792, in which he particularly states, in what manner he conceived the minds of the people were to be acted upon; the manner in which they were to be allured and deluded; and advises Mr. Vaughan to collect some choice flowers from several publications which he refers to. You will recollect, also, that the gentleman to whom that letter was addressed, although present in court, has not been called to explain any of the transactions which have taken place. That letter was very early in the transactions stated tu you, and shows most clearly, and plainly, that the prisoner was at the very foundation and root of every thing—He was not a perf0n who was deluded and led away—He wassend a deputation to that meeting, I havem one whose whole heart was in the cause, and who was contriving all the delusions which are imputed to the persons who were concerned in these transactions. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12004 These things having been done, and the, people having been by such means considerably set against the constitution established in the country, the leaders of these societies began to consider what measures they should take. There had been for some time in Scotland, a number of societies, which had been acting upon the same principles, and holding a correspondence with the London Corresponding Society; and these societies in Scotland had formed a meeting, called a Convention of Delegates, which had met early in the year 1793, and had then adjourned, I think to November 1793. These ople, when they originally met, appear to Fave had exactly the views which were steted by my friend who last addressed you, as the views of the London Societies
SOLICITORGENERAL 12006 During this interval, you will observe that avery private and particular correspondence took place. There isa letter from Skirvin to Hardy, of the 25th of May, 1793
SOLICITORGENERAL 12008 This letter of the 5th of October, 17, having been written by Mr. Hardy, a lena came trom Mr. Skirving to him, in an offical way, Seating that those deputies might i sent

SOLICITORGENERAL 12020 On the 5th of October, 1793, Mr. Hardy writes a letter to Mr. Skirving, in which he speaks of the trials of Muir and Palmer, who had heen prosecuted for seditious conduct, and then says, he General Convention which you mention, eppears to Mr. Margarot, to whom alone I have communicated your fetter, (the letter to which this refers, seems to have been dated the 2nd of October; but it has not been fuund) “ appears to Mr. Margarot and myself to be a very excellent measure; and, as such, I could wish you, without delay, to communicate it officially to our society, without any ways mentioning that you had written to me privately. —I mentioned this letter before

SOLICITORGENERAL 12028 Now, gentlemen, you will observe that the four last of these have no connexion whatever with a parliamentary refurm
SOLICITORGENERAL 12030 When persons talk of rational and lawful means, you must of necessity understand them to use those words in the sense, and according to the construction which they themselves put upon the words. They say, that their delegate should on no account depart from the principles of the socicty; namely, the obtaining annual parliaments and universal suffrage, ‘by rational and lawful means—In the seventh instruction, they state what they conceive to be lawful means; namely, “ Thatit is the duty of the people to Tesist any act of parliament repugnant to the original prineiples of the constitution, as would be every attempt to prohibit associations for the purpose of reform
SOLICITORGENERAL 12032 It seems to me, therefore, that these articles of instruction, upon the very face of them, import a determination to resist the constituted power and authority of the country, ifa resistance to this constituted power was necessary to carry into execution their obtaining annual parliaments, and universal suffrage, by rational and lawful means ; and that they considered resistance to the power of the constituted authorities, as lawful means to effect that purpose
SOLICITORGENERAL 12034 Pope of 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12035 ‘most explicitly declare their resolution to maintain the object which they had in view, by what they call rational and lawful means ; which they have sufticiently shown jo be such acts as are in direct opposition to the constituted authority of the country, and, consequently, acts of rebellion. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12036 Gentlemen, when this again is compared with the report of their committee cf constitution; and when I have shown that their avowed principle is rebellion against every government which is not constituted in the manner in which they say a government ought to be constituted, it is impossible to give any other construction to these words, “rational and lawful means, than that which I have given; namely, such means as, by the exercise of their reason, unprejudiced, they were taught to believe were lawful means ; among which they included the right of the. minority to resist even a vast majority of the country, if that majority attempted to withhold from them those rights which they considered as indefeasible civil rights: namely, a right to shure in the whole of the government of their country, as well executive as legislative. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12037 Gentlemen, the instructions which are given to the delogates of the Society for Conj Stitutional Information, are couched, unques‘tionably, in much more cautious language.They contain no such resolution with respectto resistance, as is contained in the resolutions of the London Corresponding Society
SOLICITORGENERAL 12039 Gentlemen, you will recollect that one of the resolutions of this Scotch Convention went directly upon the foundation of that ine struction ; going, indeed, considerably beyond it; and when I am told that persons who send delegatcs, are to be considered as giving to those delegates no other authority than what they specifically gave them, I admit ; that to a certain degree, that is true; but then, the moment they know that these delegates go beyond their authority, they ought, unquestionably, at least, to disavow them
SOLICITORGENERAL 12041 Then what were the proceedings of this as
SOLICITORGENERAL 12042 4.1L 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12043 sembly when it met
SOLICITORGENERAL 12045 Af ithad been described as a meeting of the societies of Sheffield—of the societies of London—of the societies of Norwich, and so on; describing them in this way, there would have een a possibility of ascertaining of whom they were composed
SOLICITORGENERAL 12047 The purpose suggested by the learned and 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12048 [igs ingenious counsel, is one that cannot have been within their view. It would have been totally inconsistent, even with their ovn principles, to have pretended to convey to the parliament of this country, by means of the opinions of a number of aslestes of the diffe. rent societies; the opinions of the pes the persons so delegated having clearly no right whatever to state, that what they resolved upon, was any thing more than the opinion of a variety of clubs, or rather of some of the several individual members who composd those clubs
SOLICITORGENERAL 12050 Mr. Yorke said, and truly, that the conver tion at Edinburgh, had declared itself a cot vention of the people, before the people were Prepared to acknowledge them as such; that they had thereby split upon a rock, been able to carry their intentions intoexect tion, and had therefore failed ; that they to have addressed the public at large up? the subject, and thus to have pre the public mind; and if they found the ready to support them in the charecter convention, which they meant to assume, to declare themselves such, and to assume the power and superiorities, and all the & thoritiesof a convention of the people. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12051 Gentlemen this assembly of delegates of clubs, having proceeded in this manner, thought proper, not only to call itself a Convention of the People, a British Convention of the People, necessarily including the whole island, but the BRITISH CONVENTION, ONE AND INDIVISIBLE, and to date their transactions, the first year of the British Convention, One and Indivisible. What could this be meant to express, but that they considered themselves as the whole people of Great Britain, united, by delegation, in one common cause, not to be separated—not to be divided, until they had completely and effectually cartied into execution those purposes which the several delegates carried with them into this assembly 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12053 What was the argument which Mr. Gibbs pressed so much upon you? He did not deny, that the acts of his client were extremely blameable ; very seditious ; but thty do not, said he, amount to high treason. And why did he assert, that they did not amount to high treason? ‘“ Because the evidence, taken together, does not show that the prisoner had conceived, within his mind, the guilty purpose and intent of destroying the government of the country, deposing the king, and establishing a democratic government in its stead. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12054 In the prosecutions carried on in Scotland. against the members of the British Convention, Margarot, Gerrald, Skirving, and the rest, the full evidence was not possessed by those who prosecuted ; they could not establish, by evidence, that degree of criminality inthe minds of the parties, which is essentially necessary for the purpose of constituting the crime of high treason ; and, therefore, No blame is upon that account imputable, as I contend, to the courts in Scotland, supposing the act to be high treason. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12055 The courts there are accused of having heen over rigorous in their sentences
SOLICITORGENERAL 12057 The question which was afterwards principally agitated, was, whether there existed, in the law of Scotland, a distinct crime, denominated by the law of Scotland, “ Sedition, which the law of England considers as a mere misdemeanor, of different degrees of heinousness, till it amounts to the crime of high treason. Butif there did exist that distinction between treason and sedition, in the law of Scotland (and sedition, in the ancient law of England, seems to have been considered as a distinct crime, in very remote times), and if sedition in Scotland was capable of being punished as such, a very severe punishment must be the proper punishment for a crime which arose to that height, that the only question which could possibly be made upon it was, whether it did, or did not, amount to the heinous crime of high treason. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12058 Gentlemen, the resolutions and proceedings of this society in Scotland are very extraordinary; they begin with declaring themselves the British Convention, and their several proceedings have been read to you, in which itappears that they corresponded with the prisonerat the bar, and with several other persons. It also appears that they adopted several of the most seditious proceedings which have been had in this country, and that they had reports made to them of the state of the societies in England, as well as in Scotland, the object of which was to justify their declaring themselves a convention of the people. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12059 It appears in the proceedings of the 6th of November, 1793, that one of the Edinburgh delegates having moved that the London delegates should state the situation of their societies, citizen Margarot answered, ‘that the 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12060 “ I apprehend that this statement of the question is not strictly correct. The doctrines asserted by the counsel for the crown and sanctioned by the high court of ssticianys in the cases of Maurice Margarot and the other members of the British Convention, respecting the crime of sedition, have been much canvassed and by many distinguished lawyers impugned ; the true grounds on which the propriety of the decision of the court of justiciary has been questioned, will be found in the ingenious and powerful arguments which were delivered by the very learned and able persons who disputed the relevancy of the indictment in the case of Joseph Gerrald. Sce the speeches of Mr. Gillies and Mr. Laing in this Collection, vol. 38, pp. 827. 69. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12061 societies in London were very nuincrous, though sometimes tluctuating—in some parts of England whole towns are reformers; in Sheflicld and environs there are fifty thousand,"—thouch it has been shown to you that the society there never consisted of more than six hundred. thirty socicties in one. If, said Margarot, “ we could get a convention of England and Scotland called, we might represent six or seven hundred thousand inales, which is a majority of all the adults in the kingdom, and ministry would not dare to refuse us our rights. It was in consequence of this representation that they thought fit to give themselves the title which [have stated to you. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12062 Gentlemen, you will recollect that in their Proceedings they went to the extent of making a new union between England and Scotland; an union which should perfectly remove all boundaries of distinction between ‘the two kingdoms. Whether that would or would not be a wise thing, may certainly ad- 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12063 mit of a great deal of question; but there is a contract existing between the two countries upon the subject, and the persons assembled at this meeting, take upon themselves, as far as their authority goes, to break through that contract, assuming a power of a most extraordinary kind; not only sovereign power, but Sovereigu pene tending to the destruction of a solenin league between the two nations, at One time separate, distinct, and independent sovereign powers. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12064 They resolved to publish an address to the ; 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12065 public, and a committee. was appointed to consider the means, and to draw up the outlines of a plan of general union and co-operation between the two nations in their generalpursuit of a thorough reform of parliament,They which was unanimously agreed to. likewise had a committee to draw up rules for their internal government, and tickets forand they resolved, that this; 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12066 admission ; should be a standing law of this, and all future conventions, looking clearly in prospect, toa regular and constant establishment, and not to an accidental establishment, for a particular purpose. ‘Tisere are several other pro-ceedings which deserve your attention, but they are infinitely too numerous for me, now, to observe upon ; such as proposing a general fast, and a variety of other procecdings, which clearly shew, that they considered themselves as an assembly of a very different description from that of delegates of the several societies, met simply for the purpose of petitioning parliament fora reform in parliament. They received contributions; patriotic gifts and donations; they adopted, in all their proceedings those expressions which had been used in the French Convention; they talked of their own assembly, as the House; of taking the sense of the House; and several other things must have occurred to you, in the course of their proceedings, if you looked at them, or 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12067 “In Norwich there are , 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12068 attended to them, when they were read, by which you must be convinced, they had in view an establishment, upon principles ver different from those on which a meeting a delegates of societies, for the purpose of ob-taining a reform in parliament, ought to have been formed. You likewise recollect the pains they tok to enlighten the Highlanders of Scotland. It is impossible not to consider the terms they used for this purpose as an incitemcat, directly, to the Highlanders to arm themselres. You recollect the circumstance of a picture of a Highlander, armed with his broad sed and target ; and there are other circumstuce of the same tendency, which are not now ix mediately and distinctly inmy memory. There is also this resolution : “ That it be recommended to the different societies throughout the country, to copy the Bill of Rights into their minute books, as the ground of their proceedings, in order to prevent improper constructions upun their conduct, a friends to reform. This recommenistis sccins to me to be precisely upon that princt ple of deception which I have before nouced. There could be no purpose whatever, for which this resolution was to be inserted m their minute books, but to deceive—to hold out a peaceable and quiet reformation, whilst they meant the reverse. If they really 3 proved of the Bill of Rights, had it not beea universally derided in the books of whxb they had testified the strongest approbation, — in a work, in which it was called a bill of wrongs, and treated with the utmost disregard and contempt? But it served extremely wel for the purpose; not only to cover the proceedings of the different societies, but to mislead those societies, and to tell them, that the Bill of Rights authorized the a sembling a couvention of the people. peuple in the different counties were told that the Bill of Rights was the foundation all their proceedings, andthat therefore theyshould insert it in all their books; and whenthey were told, that it was lawful to assemblea convention of the people, they were ledto believe, that the Bill of Rights madeit lw ful for them to do so. These circumstances tend to show the means by which the poot cople, who were engaged with them, bare Beets led and deceived, like that unfortusate man who was examined, Hill. He told yoo that he had nothing in view but the constr tion of the House of Commons, as it was 2 the year 1688; there being, in effect, no al. teration after that time, except the 7 act, and some other acts, which tended rather to the benefit of the people, than to their 2 jury, in any way whatever. Lo. Then comes their famous resolutions f assembling a Convention of Emergency, & which a blank was left in the minutes, which they came to, on the 28th of Nose ber, I798
SOLICITORGENERAL 12070 Vhese resolutions, and a declaration accomPanying them, for which a blank was left in the minutes, and which were not to be inserted till after the end of their proceedings, Were in the fullowing words: “ Resolved, that the following declarations and resolutions be serted at the end of our minutes : “ That us convention, considering the calamitous consequences of any act of the legislature, which may tend to deprive the whole, or any part of the people, of their undoubted right to meet, either by themselves, or by delegation, to discuss any matter relative to their common interest, whether of a public or private nature, and holding the same to be totally inconsis‘ent with the first principles and safety of society, and also subversive of our known and acknowledged Constitutional Liberties, do hereby declare, before God and the World Si —which, you recollect, is the solemn manner in which an oath is taken, in Scotland, by persons ofa particular description—“ that we shall follow the wholesome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which shall militate against the constitution of our country, and shall continue to assemble and consider of the best means by which we can accomplish a real representation of the people, and annual election, until compelled to desist by superior force. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12071 Gentlemen, what is this but a declaration, that they would resist force by force; that they would resist, unquestionably, inferior force; and that it should be superior force only that should compel them to desist : « And we do resolve, that the first notice given for the introduction of a Convention Bill or any bill of a similar tendency to that passed in Ireland, in the last session of their parliament, or any bill for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act
SOLICITORGENERAL 12073 What is this but a declaration, that, if they were compelled by superior force, to discontinue their meetings at Edinburgh, where they were then sitting, they would not, therefore, cease to be aconvention of the people, but that they would repair immediately to such place as the Secret Committee should appoint; that the first seven members, who should meet at such place, should have power to declare the sitting permanent, should constitute a convention immediately, and the moment they amuunted to twenty-one, they should proceed to business? If they had been compelled by superior force, by the authority and power of the government of the country, to desist from their meeting at Edinburgh and had assembled themselves again, in another part of the country, what could that assembly meet for, but for the purpose of evading the effect of that superior force, which miglit have dispersed them at Edinburgh, and of acting in that place, at which they should afterwards assemble with more effect, because supported with that degree of force which they might conceive sufficient to protect them against the existing constituted government of the country. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12074 They likewise resolved,—“ That each delegate, immediately on his return home, do convene his constituents, and explain to them the necessity of electing a delegate or delegates ;" which I conceive must necessarily mean something like the constitution of the French National Assembly, who have persons to fill immediately, without any delay, the seats which become vacant; “ and of establishing a fund, without delay, against any of these emergencies, for his or their expense, and that they do instruct the said delegate or delegates, to hold themselves ready to depart at one hour’s warning
SOLICITORGENERAL 12076 Now, gentlemen, this was communicated most completely to Mr. Hardy, by a letter, written to him by Mr. Margarot, on the 11th of December, 1793; and Margarot expressly states, that the convention had declured itself permanent ; by which he must have meant, that the effect of this declaration was, as it obviously was, to make the convention a perTanent assembly, the declaration of permanency being one of the most important parts of the proceedings of the French National Convention, at the same time it declared itself a National Convention. The means which it took for the purpose, being that of destroying, at least in the opinion of the people, all authoritative collection of revenue, whenever the assembly should be dispersed, and authorizing the collection, so long only as the a sembly should continue sitting. And gentle. men, you will recollect, in the history of you own country, the same sort of permanency, under the authority of an act o' parliamea, was the means by which the parliament, 0 the reign of Charles ist, finally destroyed the authority of that monarch. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12077 This letter of Margarot to Hardy has like wise a direct reference to the appointrent a the sitting of this convention, by the Secret Committee, in some other place, in case thes should be dispersed. It states, that the qovention had declared itself permanent; by which it must have adverted to this resolutza, which you will see is, in effect, a declaratsa of permanency; and it likewise says, te are to sit in some other part of the country, not yet declared, in case of their i which must refer (I am quoting only fon memory, for I have not the letter in my hand) ‘to that part of the resolutions, by which it was made of the instructions b the Secret Committee, without delay, to irs place at which the convention should mee, in case of its dispersion, or under other circum stances, in which they thought it proper tha the Convention of Emergency should meet. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12078 Gentlemen, I beg pardon for stating thi letter. Iam told, that, by some accident, has not been given in evidence, therefore you will lay that quite out of your consideraton You will recollect, however, that, in pursuance of these resolutions, the convention actualy did refuse to disperse, until compelled by 2 superior force; and this is proved by 2 letter of Margarot, in which he states, that Gemald and himself were pulled out of the chai; and upon the cross-examination of Ross by Mr. Erskine, the same fact was stated; 9 that they not only came to the resolution, bat they really acted upon it, to a certain degree. But the other parts ‘of these resolutions when considered with reference to the whol, have very extraordinary consequences; you will observe that this convention was meet as a Convention of Emergency, at2 cret place, to be appointed by a Secret mittee, not only in case of its being compe! to desist from its proceedings, sitting at burgh, by superior force, but also in sm other cases; particularly, as soon as ay 0 tice should be given for the introduction of convention bill. As soon as any meaxlt should appear to be taken by the governmest of the country for the purpose o on their meeting, which they should might be likely to have effect, they were assemble in that secret place to be appot! by the committee of emergency, remos themselves from Edinburgh, in which a they might not think they should be 9 to resist the powers of ae non as Le more distant place. ‘This they extend0 a the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act to the admission of foreign troops ; a report having been very industriously circulated of an intention to bring overa great number of foreign troops into this country. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12079 But they declare also, that this convention shall meet as a Convention of Emergency in another event; that is, in case of invasion. Iam sure I recollect the letter having been read which informed Hardy of the secret resolutions, because I recollect that the words “in case of an invasion are omitted in that letter. But Margarot states in that letter that the convention has done that which he does not think it safe to communicate by letter: “ The convention proceed with great spirit ; we sit daily; and last week we came to aresolution which we fancy will give pleasure to every friend to reform. As the minutes are to be printed, we will at present only give you the heads of it; viz—That should any attempt be made by government for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus bill, the introduction of a convention bill, or the landing of foreign troops in Great Britain or Ireland, the delegates are immediately to assemble in convention at a certain place (the appointment of which is left with a secret committee) ; that when seven delegates shall be thus assembled they shall declare themselves permanent, and when their number amounts to twenty-one they shall proceed to business. Thus, you sec, we are providing against what may happen. This is a letter written to Mr. Hardy himself.“ Thus you see, we are providing against what may happen. Then the letter proceeds to state— “ Letters convey but very imperfectly, and with no great degree of safety, what we might wish to inform each other of. And ina subsequent letter of the 8th of Deccmber, 1793, you will find he says—“ Not daring any onger to trust tu the post, we send you all these papers in a parcel ; what papers these were does not appear. “ You will be so good as to make us acquainted with their sate arrival. Gerrald wishes to get to London as S00n as possible; he will communicate that " which cannot so fully be expressed by letter. You may consider this as a private letter ; but you may read such parts of it as you think Proper to any member of the society, especially where it may be productive of good. Then here are resolutions come to which they are afraid to enter on the minutes of their proceedings ; which they are afraid to communicate entire in their correspondence between each other; which they Icave, therefore, to be communicated by word of mouth by one of the parties present: and even the very letter, thus cautiously written, is written to Mr. Hardy as aa private letter, of which he might communicate such parts as he might think proper to any member of the society, leaving to him the selection of the matter, and the parts he might so communicate;perhaps, according to the degree of fervor in the public cause he might conceive a particular member to have, and the particular confidence he might have in the discretion of that member; and this is to be especially where it may be productive of good ; showing most clearly by this that the prisoner was the active means by which the whole of this conspiracy was to be carricd on; the person with whom Margarot (who was then acting as agent of the society at Edinburgh) was to correspond, in whose discretion he was wholly to confide, and who was to communicate to the other members such partsonly of this correspondence—mutilated as it is, from the fear of danger that may attend acommunication hy letter —to communicate such parts of it only as he thought proper. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12080 Gentlemen, I stated that it was my intention to advert to that part of the minutes which followed the blank where these resolutions ought to have been entered, if they had been entered according to the daily and the ordinary course of their proceedings. After stating the solemn manner in which these resolutions were passed—the very solemnity with which they were passed showing the importance which those persons attached to them, and the omission of the word invasion in the communication still more strongly showing the importance which they attached to that particular word—“ Citizen Margarot read and proposed the following motion— “that a secret committee of three with the secretary be appointed to determine the place where such convention of emergency shalk meet ; that such place shall remuin a secret with them and with the secretary of this convention ; and that each delegate shall, at the breaking up of the present session, be entrusted witb a sealed letter containing the name of the place of meeting—that this letter shall be delivered unopened to his constituents, the receipt of which shall be acknowledged by a letter to the secretary—preserved in the same state until the period shall arrive at which it shall be deemed necessary for the delegates to set off. So that the place of meeting of this convention was not only to be determined upon by a secret committee of three (a very small number), but they also resolved that it should remain secret with them and the secretary; and that at the breaking up of the then present session (if during the session it should be necessary to make use of this cominittee of emergency at a secret place) each member should carry with him, ina sealed letter, the name of the place of meeting; that this should be delivered unopened to his constituents; that the receipt should be acknowledged by a letter to the secretary; and that the scaled letter should remain in the same state till the period should arrive at which it should be deemed necessary for the delegates to set off. So it was not to be known to any one member of the society, except the secret committee and their secretary, where that place was to be. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12081 Now, gentlemen, bave such proceedings as these the least semblance of a design to petition parliament only for the purpose of parliamentary reform? It is utterly absurd to give any credit to stich a suggestion. And, gentlemen, you will likewise recollect that my learned friend, Mr. Gibbs, admitted, that if you could not give his construction to their proceedings, you must necessarily give the construction which we put upon them —that if you could not take the colour he gave you; if you could not persuade yourselves that the only object of this meeting was quictly and peaceably to prepare petitions to the parliament, praying that that reform in the election of representatives might be carried into execution which they pretended they had proposed upon the wild plan, as I venture to call it, of the duke of Richmond, or any other specific plan they might think proper to adopt ; if the object of their mecting was any thing beyond that, it was impossible for him to justify it, though he should not admit it to receive all the attributes which we have givenit. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12082 The minutes of this day’s sitting refer toa proceeding which, I think, distinctly had in view that which afterwards appears in other parts of the proceedings—the supporting a convention by force. It is idle to say that a convention of this kind could have any effect whatever unless supported by force; and therefore it is not necessary to show you that any proceedings had taken place for the purpose; for when it is of necessity that in order to carry the thing into execution it should be supported by force, it is not necessary to show you that proceedings had been had for the purpose of creating that force. If persons orm a plan (such as was fabricated for the bishop of Rochester, and several persons of high rank) to bring in the Pretender—If that had been a real paper signed with the names of those persons who it was supposed had signed it (it turned out to be a wicked contrivance of two villanous men); but if it had been a real paper, it would have been an act of high treason, though they had procured:no force. But the moment they put their hands to that paper, which demonstrated their intention to conspire to overturn the government of the country ; demonstrating that intention by an overt act, namely, the puting their hands to that paper; the crime of high treason was complete, though they could not possibly have carried it into eftect but by raising an armed force, and notwithstanding they had taken no steps to raising that armed force. But here you have several traits of the tendency of this society to raise an armed force, even in the proceedings of this convention. They resolved —“ that a fund should be raised by subscription for defraying the expense of small patriotic publications to be distributed in the Highlands; that every publication should bear the figure of a Michldad-cyn in full dress, with target and broad sword to attract the attention of Highland-men: no publication to cost more than half a penns For what purpose could such publicat.. possibly be distributed, but to excite m. people m the Highlands to armthemselye' —What has the figure of a Highlander in iu dress, with target and broad sword, to do wi: a quiet, peaceable petition to reform pani ment? It has no connexion with it in te world. It has a clear connexion with acx vention which was intended to be suppene. by force of arms; but has no possible couzeion whatever with that which my lease friend says was the object of this conveutx. namely, simply and only petitioning pow ment. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12083 They propose, also, to appoint a commie of observation in London, for the purpox observing what was done there. What pox. upon that occasion? Margarot says—“ th: there was no occasion for a committee of tt: nature in London, as there were several the sand people in that city upon the look. It was accordingly agreed, that the comm tee should request the London commitet correspondence to give the earliest inteigence of what passed in parliament. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12084 Gentlemen, you will recollect that wu committee so referred to, was the Secret (ca mittee of the London Corresponding Socie's: which Secret Committee was by this 1e lution converted into a committee of obser tion for the British Convention, for the pz pose of giving information of every tit which should pass in parliament, sod London, upon this subject. That clea shows the connexion and dependence of ta very convention upon the London Core ponding Society, in the hands of its leades: videlicct, the Secret Committee, and those directed that Secret Committeewhich shes that the whole was really, and in effect, operation of those societies in London; a that the proceedings at Edinburgh were proceedings of persons who were only al: as the puppets of those in London. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12085 You will recollect the manner in which th Highlanders were to be enlighteas’—ty representations to them of their situs aggravated and false in the highest dese You will likewise recollect, that throught the proceedings of this convention they1" attempting to establish, by motions, te" tions, and soon, every thing that was oet sary to be established for the purpox convention actually meeting as a convents of the people, upon the principles upon “ we have proved they intended to act they were preparing to publish the nalun unalienable, and imprescriptible rights of and that a committee was appointed for that purpuse. To show that application to parliament was not within the considerativa of" of those who were at least the leading m bers in this business, or indeed the 930 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12086 of the members of the convention, a nouol for drawing out a scroil of a petition 0 parler ment was read on the of Novembes 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12087 1798, the tenth day’s sitting, and the order of the day was moved upon it. Now this isa meeting which my learned friends would attempt to persuade you was solely for the purpose of petitioning parliament, and one of the first things they do is, to move the order of the day upon a motion for petitioning parTiament. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12088 You recollect, eiilenets the manner in which they treated distinctions of rank in the case of lurd Daer—in the use of the word gentleman—the insipidity of the term gentleman, and the propriety of the term citizen— and a thousand other circumstances, which abow throughout the principles which the members of this convention meant to adopt, to carry into effect as far as they could You will recollect what Mr. Skirving said in the course of the proceedings. Upon a motion that was made he insisted “ that it was prpce on all occasions to take the opinion of the primary societies, and he considered the convention as only a committee of the people. So that Mr. Skirving, in the very Proceedings of this conventiun, was acting upon the grand principles of all those rights of man—that every form of government to be established among them was to be considered only as a committee of the people, and that the sense of the people was to be taken upon all acea-ions. Principles which the French Rational assemblies have constantly found it impossible to carry into execution; and you Toust particularly recollect that they refused to carry them into execution upon the most important subject which could come before them, namely, the death of their king. For when some of the leading members—some of the must enlightened—probably with a view of saving the king, wished to refer the consideration of tha' question to the primary assemblies in different parts of the country, it was negatived, on the ground of the impussi Ddility of carrving it into real and effectual axectition ; and because, if it could have been earried effectually into. execution, it must have tended w destroy the Convention itself. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12089 Gentlemen, you will recollect likewise, in the course of the debate which took place upon what they termed the unprecedented infringement of the liberty of the press, and the arbitrary sentence of judge Wilson against Mr. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12090 ; Holt. Mr. Justice Wilson being a man whom all those who are of the same profession must revember with deep regret and concern, and must acknowledge that he was one of the worthiestand the most upright men that ever graced the bench. gentlemen, in taking notice of these things, which they consider as abuses, Mr. Margarot observes— “It is unnecessary to attempt to lop off the branches while we are endeavouring to: and there is a blank, Endeavouring to what? How can you fill up that blank 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12092 Gentlemen, I might go through the whole of the minutes of the proceedinys of this convention ; there are several other passages which equally meritattention; and it is evident that throughout the whole of their proceedings they contemplated the idea of acting by force of their own authority, supported by the force of so many of the people at large as they could prevail upon to sustain their measures ; that they looked to the attainment of their objects by those means; and probably also by the assistance of that foreign power which the two societies in London, the Constitutional Society, and the London Corresponding Society, had, in the latter end of the year 1792, clearly invoked—by means, probably, of the assistance of that power, for you cannot give any other interpretation to the words,“ In the case of an invasion. They clearly looked to the atainment of their ends cither by their own force alone, or by that force assisted by such foreign force. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12093 This convention being dispersed by the superior force of the constituted government, after that resistance which the members of the convention thought proper to give, and. which necessarily was only a formal resiatance, because they had not prepared measures for any more effectual resistance—what .was done 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12095 Gentlemen, the first proceedings which seem to have been directly taken for that purpose were the resolutions of the Constitutional Society, on the 17th of January 1794; but previous to that time a letter was written by the prisoner, on the 10th of January, to Mr. Adams, the Secretary of the Constitutional Society, merely informing him of the anniversary dinner ef the London Corresponding Society, intended on the 20th of January, 1794. I meation that circumstance, because it drew both the Societies together in the transactions of that day. There was no reason for giving the Constitutional Society any notice of that anniversary dinner, unless for the purpose of enabling them to attend it if they thought proper. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12096 Gentlemen, I should have reminded you, that in the mean time Mr. Margarot had communicated to Mr. Hardy the circumstances which had passed at the dispersion of the British Convention, and had excited him by all means to take some spirited resolves upon the subject—Mr. Hardy in his answer to Margarot, continued to represent that the society would act as Margarot desired them to do; and he writes to the secretary of the society at Norwich, this letter, on the 11th of January, 1794.—Fellow Citizen. I have just received a letter from citizen Margarot, at Edinburgh, with some of the Edinburgh Gazetteers, (you observe this is a day after the letter he wrote to Adams, informing him of the anniversary dinner, of the 20th of January) “where you will see that citizen Skirving is found guilty, and sentenced for fourteen years transportation to Botany Bay. Margarot’s trial comes on next. He meets it with great firmness and resolution. I have No time to make comments on the proceedings; but I think our opponents are cutting their own throats as fast as they can. Now is the time for us to do something worthy of men. Why was it the time for them to do something worthy of men 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12098 What was in the mind of Mr. Hardy when he wrote that letter? What could be in his mind, but that persuasion which we see generally diffused throughout all their proceedings, that the success of the French republic, was intimately connected with the success of their own schemes; that they were all embarked in one common cause—that their hope and reliance was not upon a majority of the people of this country—for I think even the report of the committce of constitution shows, that they had no hope of obtaining that majority, but that they did hope they should obtain so large a party, that, with the success of the French republic, they should be able finally to accomplish their object—at least they thought that that was the time to strike. ‘ Now is the time for us tu do something worthy of men—the brave defenders of liberty South of the English Channel, are performing wonders; driving their enemies before them, like chaff before the whirlwind. The letter proceeds, “ The London Corresponding Society is to have a general meeting, and an anniversa y dinner, on Monday the 20th instant, at the Glohe-lavern, Strand. Adverting, you see, in this very letter to that intended meeting, on the 20th of January; a meeting upon which my learned friends have not dared to say one single word—adverting to that meeting, as the time when it might reasonably be supposed, that something would be donc in consequence of what was mentioned in the former part of this letter. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12099 There is one passage in this letter, trifling as it may appear, which I cannot avoid observing upon; because it is a pi which, give me leave to say, a little contradicts that character which has been given of the prsoner, “I have sent you some of Marzarot'’s and Skirving’s indictment, with two copies of a pamphlet on an am the author is a member of our society—I y may putitin practice. It will be a great saving to many families—also a diminution of the revenue—for every one brewing their own beer, pay no duty for it. So that, you see, the prisoner had in his contemplation, a dimimtion of the revenue of the country, as an object which he thought proper to recommend te the person to whum he wrote at Norwich; uot simply for the purpose of saving money to families, but as it would affect the revenue of the country, and therefore, as he conceived affect those persons whom he considered his enemies, the constituted government of the country. It is a trifling circumstance, but trifling circumstances like these, which are the natural overflowing of a man’s mind, show the temper of that mind more than what he writes when he is under some degree of restraint. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12100 Gentlemen, I shall next notice to you, some resolutions of the Society for Consutetional Information, on the 17th of January, 1794, upon which, as I recollect, no observation has been made by either of the learned counsel, and which no member of the Consttutional Society has been called to explain. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12101 “ Resolved, that law ceases to be an object of obedience, whenever it becomes an instrument of oppression. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12102 “Resolved, that we recall to mind with the deepest satisfaction, the merited fate of the infamous Jefferies, once lord chief justice of England, who at the era of the glorious revolution, for the many iniquitous sentences which he had passed, was torn to pieces, by a brave and injured pcople. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12103 “ Resolved, that those who imitate his example, deserve his fate. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12104 Gentlemen, when these resolutions are considered with reference to that which follows, what is the meaning of them, bat an incitement to the people of Scotland (for you see it has reference to those cases in Scotland) to follow the example of the persons who are represented as having torm to pieces the infmous Jefferies ? 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12105 “ Resolved, that the Tweed, though it may divide countries, ought not, and does not, make a separation between those principles of common sccurity, in which Englishmen, and Scutchmen, are equally interested ; that in justice in Scotland, is injustice in England; and that the safety of Englishmen is endan gered whenever their brethren of Scotland, or a conduct which entitles them to the approbation of all wise, and the support of all brave men, are sentenced to Botany Bay; 3 punishment hitherto inflicted only on felons, 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12106 Here they resolve, that the conduct of those f you approve of it, you ee ace ear ne i A 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12107 MeocRr a rR ATH ER 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12108 a em eo eTealgted in Scotland, was not only not blameaJe, but a conduct which entitled them to the approbation of all wise and the support of all brave men. The epithet, brave, is pretty striking. A peaccable and constitutional supof a man, does not require much bravery; ut a support by force, may require bravery, when therefore the approbation of all wise, and the support of all brave men, is called for, one may easily guess what it is that the per- , sons who enter into those resolutions mean.They add, 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12109 “ Resolved, that we see with regret, but see without fear, that the period is fast approaching, when the liberties of Britons mustdepend, not upon reason, to which they have long appealed, nor on their powers of expressing it, but on their firm, and undaunted resolution to oppuse tyranny, by the same meansby which it is exercised. What is that but an explicit declaration, that the time was fast approaching, when they conceived, that it! would be necessary to exert force? Whetheraccording to their ideas, force had hecomeMecessary or not, you cannot determine. It never can be an object of determination for a jury, or for any court of justice, whether the subjects of a government, are entitled tu rise in rebellion against that government, in connence of any conduct of that government. It 1s a question, which whenever it does arise, can be decided only by the sword. It never can come into discussion in a court of justice. Therefore, if the conduct of the government of the country has been ever so oppressive, a court of justice cannot permit itself to discuss, whether that occasion has arisen, which amounts to the dissulution of all government, and when therefore it can itself have no authority to act—This resolution follows. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12110 “ Resolved, that we approve of the conduct of the British Convention, who though assailled by force, have not been answered by argument, and who, unlike the members of a certain assembly, have no interest distinct from the common body of the people. Aresolution, which not only adopts all the proceedings of that convention, and all their conduct but particularly and distinctly adopts that part of their conduct, in which they declared themselves a Convention of the People, and declared that they meant by that declaration, that they were representatives of the common body of the people. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12111 The last resolution is, “‘ That a copy of the above resolutions be transmitted to citizen William Skirving, secretary to the British Convention, who is now imprisoned, under colour of law, in the Tolbvoth of Edinburgh. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12112 Gentlemen, this led to the proceedings of the 20th of January, 1794, at the Globe tavern, and these proceedings are extremely strong— a recollect that these proceedings appear to we been wholly a concerted business; that they were nothing like the acts of the persons who met there, but that they were proceedings previously determined upon, Mr. Thelwall, seems to have had ‘a principal hand in Preparing the account of the proceedings, which was printed and distributed; and he detivered it to Davidson the printer, to be printed on the 18th of January—Gentlemen, this account of the proceedings, begins thus, “ Ata general mecting of the London Corresponding Society heldatthe Globe tavern, in the Strand, on Monday, the 20th day of January, 1794,citizen John Martin in the chair—The following address to the people of Great Britain, 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12113 ‘and Ireland, was read and agreed to. So that you see, gentlemen, they are detcrmined to prucced with a sort of caution, which had not been observed in the proceedings of the Convention at Edinburgh, in preparing the minds of the people by a previous address for the meeting of an assembly, which should assume the character of a convention of the people. This you will recollect was an idea which clearly had occurred to some persons who were concerned in the conspiracy, particularly to Mr. Yorke; and which he communicated in conversations which have been stated to you in evidence. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12114 This address, speaking of the abuses which are supposed to exist in the British government, and speaking of the laws of the country says—“ We ure every day told, by those persons who are interested in aupperting the corruption list, and an innumerable host of sinecure placemen, that the constitution of England is the perfection of human wisdom ; that our laws (we should rather say, their laws) are the pertection of justice ;—and then they proceed to speak of the administration of the country—They then state a number of proceedings which they think proper to find fault with—The convention bill in feland—the proceedings in Scotland—and they add—“ In Scotland, the wicked hand of power has been impudently exerted, without even the wretched formality of an act of parliament,—having before adverted to the act of parliament which had been passed in Ireland “ magistrates have forcibly intruded into the peaceful and lawful meetings of freemen, and, by force (not only without Taw, but against law) have, under colour of magisterial office interrupted their deliberations, and prevented their association;—A declaration that they conceived the dispersion of that Convention at Edinburgh was an illegal act—Then they add— «The wisdom and good conduct of the British Convention at Edinburgh, has been such as to defy their bitterest enemies to name the law which they have broken; notwithstanding which, their papers have been seized, and made use of as evidence against them; and many virtuous .and meritorious individuals have been, as cruelly as unjustly, tor theit virtuous actions, disgraced and destroyed, by infamous and illegal sentences of transportation ; and these unjust and wicked judgments have been executed with a rancour and malignity never before known in this land. Our respectable and beloved fellow citizens have been cast fettered into dungeons, amongst felons, in the hulks to which they were not sentenced. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12115 Gentlemen, what are those virtwous acts of this British Convention
SOLICITORGENERAL 12117 They then proceed—“ Citizens, we all approve the sentiments, and are daily repeating the words, for which our respectable and valuable brethren are thus unjustly suffering. We, too, associate, in order to obtain a fair, free, and full representation of the ple.—Where? In the House of Commons
SOLICITORGENERAL 12119 ‘ considered that as their inherent right, which they were determined never to forego, but with their lives. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12120 Gentlemen, this is the clearest and the most decisive declaration of the intentions of: these men, when combined with all that is before stated, and may explain any thing which is ambiguous in it, if amy thing is ambiguous. Atreally appears to me, that there is nothing

SOLICITORGENERAL 12122 They proceed—“Can you beliewe, that those who sent virtuous Inshmen and Scotchmen, fettered with felons, to Botany Bay, de not meditate, and will not attempt, to seue the first moment to send us after them; er, if we had not just cause to apprehend de same inhuman treatment—if, instead of the most imminent danger, we were in perfet safety from it, should we not disdain to es} any liberty or privilege whatever, in wha our honest Irish and Scoteb brethren did mg ally and as fully participate with wa Their cause, then, and our’s, is the same; and it is both our dety and our interest stand or fall together.

SOLICITORGENERAL 12126 Translate this into plain words, conveying a plain meaning—What is it but this—You ak by what means shall we seek redress
SOLICITORGENERAL 12128 Gentlemen, these are declarations clear and plain. My learned friend called upon 4as to show clear and plain declarations. Can any thing be more clear and more plain? dere is no caution used—they had now determined to lay aside all caution—and you will observe, that my learned friends did not attempt to say one single word in explanation of any part of this transaction
SOLICITORGENERAL 12130 here, gentlemen, they have clearly an openly declared their resolution to have such a convention of the people, and to create a ll upon the principles of the Rights of an. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12131 Now, gentlemen, if a man had proclaimed, in this country, the pretender, and there! declared his intention to establish upon the throne of this country, that family which has been driven from it, instead of that which hag since been placed upon the thrune, nu man would have entertained the slightest doubt, that the mere act of proclaiming the pretender, would have been treason; and my learned friends will recollect, that, in the course of the trial of Mr. Layer, the very case is supposed by the counsel for the crown. They say, in answer to an objection with respect to evidence, “ Suppose a man should have proclaimed the pretender, and then have gone away, and the proclairation could not found, what would be the effect of that? Could not you give, in evidence, the contents of that proclamation?’—‘ Yes, says Mr. Hungerford, the counsel for the prisoner, and who was no way a friend to that government, “ the very act of doing that, would be, in itself, an overt act of high treason. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12132 Then, if proclaiming the pretender is an overt act of high treason, is there any difference betwcen proclaiming the pretender, and proclaiming a republican government? And this is a proclamation for a republican government
SOLICITORGENERAL 12134 Then they come to the following resolution: 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12135 “ Resolved, That during the ensuing session of parliament, the general cumnuttee of this society do meet daily, for the purpese of watching the proceedings of the p:rlament, and of ‘the administration of the government of this country. —This, and the following resolution, they borrow from the British Convention, whose proceedings they had approved, droping only that part of the resulution of the British Convention which they thought it not sate to introduce into their minutes ; namely, that part respecting an invasion — “ Resulved, That, upon the first introduction of any bill, or motion, inimical to the liberties of the people; such as landing foreign troops in Great Britain or Ireland, for suspending the Habeas Corpus Act, for proclaiming martial law, or for preventing the people from mecting in Societies for Constitutional Information; or any other innovation of a similar nature. hut, on any of these emergencies —words which leave an openitg fur almost any thing—That, on any of these emergencies, the general committee shall issue summonses to the delegates of each division, and also to the secretaries of the different societies athliated and corresponding with this society, furthwith to call a general convention of the people, to be held at such place, and in such manner, as shall be specified in the summons for the purpose of taking such measures into their consideration. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12136 Gentlemen, you will recollect, that just at this time the society for Constitutional Information (who were always acting in their way in support of the measures first adopted by the London Corresponding Society) thought roper to clect Barrere, St. Andre, and Rodist, honorary members of their society; declaring, that they considered those mer as “ the most enlightened friends of Freedom— “ judicious, I think, they likewise call them. Gentlemen, the mere election of these persons to be members of their society is, in some degree, adopting their principles; but when in the very act of election they declare that they so elect them because of their principles, when men elect a person into a situation because they consider him as one of the most judicious and enlightencd friends of Freedom—when upon a political subject, they declare they consider the principles of that man to be those of a judicious and enlightened man; they really transfer all declared and avowed principles from the person so elected to their own society, and make them in effect the principles of their own socicty. You will recollect, they follow this up afterwards hy the publishing to the world their resolution for insertion of the speeches of Barrere and St. Andre upon the subject of the execution of the king of France in their minutes; and then you will particularly recollect the manner in which Barrere in his spcech describes a National Convention. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12137 Upon the first question, “ whether the person of the king is invivlable, he describes that which seems to me to be very important to recall to your attention, aithough the attorney general remarked upon it very considerably in the observations which he made upon it. Barrere says, that— The people of Paris, by making an holy insurrection against the king on the 10th of August, deprived bim of his character of inviolability; the people of the other departments applauded this insar. rection, and adupted the consequence of it; the people have therefore formally interposed ty destroy this royal inviolability ; the tacit consent of the peuple rendered the person of the king inviolable; the act of insurrection wasa tacit repeal of that consent, and was foundedor the same grounds of law as the consent itself, The king’s person is inviolable ouly with relation to the other branches of the legis ture, but not with relation to the people. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12138 Calling the attention of the public to these speeches, which is equal to publishing then, shows the intent with which these were proceeding; and that when they had as sembled a general convention of the people, supposing that convention to be approved of by the other parts of the country, they would have considered the people as having tormaly interposed their power to destroy the royal inviolability. For the assembling a conven tion of the people, acting as such, and supported by the power of the people, must of Necessity have been an insurrection of the ople against the existing government; and if the people in general, according to the system of Barrere had applauded this tmsurrectioa, and adopted the consequence of it, the people would have formally interposed to destroy the royal inviolability, and all the consequences which are stated in this speech of Barrere must have followed. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12139 The speech proceeds to discuss whether an appeal should ie made to the people, and be says---‘The people are the Suvereign. A convention is a perfect representation of the sovereign; the members of the legislative assembly acted in August upon these pnncples in summoning the Convention ; They declare that they saw but one measure which could save France, namely, to have recourse to the supreme will of the people, and to mvite the people to exercise immediately that unalienable right of Sovereiznty which the constitution had acknowledged, and which it could not subject to any restriction. then be says—‘ The public interest required that tae people should manifest their will by the election of a National Convention, formed of representatives invested by the people with unl mited powers; the people did manifest their will by the election of that Convention; the Convention being assembled is itself that sovereign will which ought to prevail; it would be contrary to every principle to suppose that the Convention is not exclusively the expression of the general yill. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12140 These societies, then, having declared that, under certaincircumstances, there should forte with be called a general convention of the people; and having, at the same time, adverted to the principles so laid down by Barrere, as the principles of a man whom they th: ta judicious and enlightened friend of fi m, they must have considered a convention of the aS people as an assembly of the nature stated in this speech of Barrere, and upon which I have before so much observed. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12141 Afterwards at a meeting of the committee on the 23d of January, it was resolved, that the toasts drank at the anniversary dinner of the society should be printed at the end of the address. These toasts testify their approbation of “ the British Convention at Edinburgh 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12142 —of “ Skirving, charged by the sentence of the Court of Justiciary with the honour of being the cause of calling that convention — of “the London Corresponding Society, and the several other societies’ and then of “ their condemned delegates. Then there is the following toast—“ Success to the arms of freedom against whomsoever directed, and confusion to despots with whomsoever allied. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12143 These words, though they do admit of another interpretation, yet are in themselves general ; and, considering the complexion of the whole of this transaction, they apply most directly to that which was the object of the meeting, 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12144 Ramely, the establishment, by force, of a convention of the people, for the purpose of effecting, as they conceived, their own freedom; a measure to which, it is perfectly clear, under certain circumstances, they meant to have recourse. There is another toast which has a degree of ridicule in it, but you will see clearly what was meant. Mr. Barlow had said in his letter to the French Convention, that it had been completely shown that a king 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12145 On the 27th of March the prisoner wrote 2letter to the Constitutional Society, in which he stated—“I am directed by the London Corresponding Society to transmit the following resolutions to the Society for Constitutional Information, and to request the senti-ments of that society respecting the important. measures which the present juncture of affairs seems to require. The London Corresponding Society conceives that the moment is arrived when a full and explicit declaration is necessary from all the friends of freedom. Therefore this letter of the prisoner declares, that that moment was arrived which is alluded to in the preceding resolutions of the 20th of January ; and then he adds—“ the Society for Constitutional Information is therefore required to determine whether or no they will be ready when called upon to act in conjunction with this and other societies to obtain afair representation of the people; whether they concur with us in seeing the necessity of & speedy convention, for the purpose of obtaining, in a constitutional and legal manner, a redress of those grievances under which we at present labour, and which can only be effectually removed by a full and fair representation of the peuple of Great Britain. The London Corresponding Society cannot but remind their friends, that the present crisis demands all the prudence, unanimity, and vigour that ever may or can be exerted by: men and Britons; nor do they doubt but that manly firmness and consistency will finally, was fred for nothing. One of their toasts is— “allthat is good in every constitution, and may we never be superstitious enough to reverence in any that which is good for nothing. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12146 Now the wor 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12147 Is superstitious enough to reverence in any that which is good for nothing, carry the allusion so directly to that letter of Barlow, and the works of Paine, in which the respect of the people of this country for monarchy has been treated as a superstitious reverence, that it is impossible to doubt what these persons meant when they gave that toast. And here I may observe, that in many of the State Trials you will find that toasts drank at meetings of persons engaged in such transactions faye always been Considered as important evidence of the minds of the persons so met; because, such: toasts are given for the express purpose of animatin the persons assembled to the acts in view and they believe shortly, terminate in the full accomplishment of all their wishes. Gentlemen, here is a tull declaration in this letter, written by the prisoner atthe bar, that he looked forward to the actual accomplishment of all his wishes. What those wishes were has been already fully and sufficiently declared. They were—to establish in this country a representative government, founded upon the broad basis of the rights of man—the annihilation of monarchy—the annihilation of what he calls aristocracy—the annihilation of all ranks and distinctions of men, and giving equal active citizenship, and an equal right to every individual in the government or his country, legislative and executive—in fine, the complete establishment of a whole 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12148 Republican government, without a king, without a House of Peers, and without any of because, they are given for the purpose ofthose circumstances which belong to the contaking advantage of the gaiety at convivialstitution of the country as now established. hours, when their hearts might be open, andHe thinks that the crisis was come which Viable to such impressions as it might bedemanded all the prudence, unanimity, and thought proper to make upon them. vigour that ever may or can be exerted by

They likewise showed the manner imwhich they meant to redress. these grievances which they here state; wher in their prior resolutions of the 20th of. January they said—that they could not exfect redress from any existing authority— that they considered themselves as persons whe, though they had been in a state of ivilized society, were now authorized to consider that association. as at an end, no. redress could be obtained by the law; andtherefore, that they must have: redress from l their own laws, and not from the laws of their lerers, enemies, and oppressors..

Will youee operate with us in the only peaceable measm that new presents itself with any prospect d success? We need not intimate to yuu, that, notwithstanding the unyaralleled audacity of a corrupt and overbearing factivn, wiich at present tramples on the rights and liberties of the people, our meetings cannot in Enslad be interrupted without. the previous adoptna of a convention bill’—under an idea that there is no means of preve:ting their meeting but that“ a measure it is our duty to anticpate, that the ties of union may be tore army drawn, and the sentiments and views of the different societies throughout the natwa be compared while it is yet in our power, so 2519 guide and direct the future operations of ibe 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12155 Tiends of freedom. Rouze, then, to une ext tion more, and let us show our cunscivusnes of this important truth. If we are to be beso down with threats, prosecutions, and illegal sentences, we are unworthy—we are incap of liberty. We must be, however, tious. Hessians and Hanoveriuns are already amosg us; and if we tamely submit, a cloud of thee armed barbarians muy shortly be poured a upon us. These words most clearly shor the purpose for which all that clamour raised upon the Hessian core being for a temporary purpose, in this countsy; they clearly show that the clamour was wed with effect upon the several country societies, for the purpose of inducing them to ake ek measures into which they could not otherwae have been led. “ Let us, then, form anole British. Convention : Another British Com vention ! : ing which we have seen at Edin ing itself a convention of the peo; upon i D at once; they are ta wait the co-operaina

SOLICITORGENERAL 12158 Gentlemen, this circular letter produced answers. Some of them have been read to you. The Norwich letter, which is dated the 29th of April, says, “ it is with great satisfaction we view the manly conduct of you and your eollesgas especially when surrounded, as you are, by adomineering aristocracy, who, hotwithstanding their great bluster, are but chicken-hearted. It concludes, ‘ we should be glad to know whether the friends of the people consent to a convention, and whether they will take an active part. A letter dated the 11th of May, 1794, was sent from the Sheffield Societies, which states a meeting in the open air at Halifax, in order to consider measures Preparatory to a general convention. This letter says, “ they were advised by us to defer at present the meeting of delegates until farther information, which should come from you (meaning the prisoner) “ on that subject. So that the thing was continually proceeding ; for this is dated the 11th of May, and you will recollect that upon the 12th this unfortunate man was arrested. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12159 There is a letter written by the prisoner on the 1st of May, 1794, which clearly and directly states the ideas he had formed upon what were to be the consequences of the measures they were about to adopt. It is in answerto a letter from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, on the 24th of April, 1794, which says, “ Being charmed with your masterly and bold approbation of the conduct of your delcgates, and noble martyrs for truth, Margarot and Gerrald, and finding your name signed as secretary to the Corresponding Society, we wish to copy your example, and beg, if you think us worth your notice, you will give us your views and intentions as soon as convenient, which I hope will be a means to stimulate and increase our numbers. They had heard nothing of the convention, because this society was just formed. They conclude witha—“ Farewell, hoping the hydra of tyrann and imposition shall soon fall under the guillotine of truth and reason. To this the prisoner, on the ist of May, writes this answer— “It is with pleasure the London Corresponding Society hear that a society on a similar plan, and with the same patriotic objects in view, is likely to be established at Newcastleupon-Tyne. If ever a ctisis arrived that required the exertions of the people, to stop the current of corruption, infamy, and despotism that seems likely to overwhelm them, it is the present. In God's name then let us use the exertions—we are called upon by every thing that is dear to us as men, and as Christians. The cause of truth and liberty must rally be omnipotent, therefore doubt not at the glorious reign of liberty and equality will ere Tong be established, and modern governments, with every appendage of wickedness and corruption, will flee in time from their genial influence, as beasts of prey to their dens of rapine and darkness from the rising sun. Certainly alluding to that which has been in their minds from the moment of that address of the Society for Constitutional Information to the National Convention of France, in which they represent what has passed in America as a faint light, but that a great and brilliant light was to burst forth upon man. That sun of reason which was ta arise and illumine the whole world, was to come from the East—from France—betore the genial influence of which, modern governments, with every appendage of wickedness and corruption, should flee. There is no possibility of doubting that in this letter the prisoner has viciwals adopted the proceedings then going forward. He adds, “ the London Corresponding Society have beheld, with indignation, the rapid advances of despotism in Britain, aud are ready cordially to unite with every other society in the three kingdom: who have for their object a full and effect representation of the people. They therefore have deputed six of their members to meet six members of the Society for Constitutional Information, to form a.Committee of Correspondence and co-operation. ‘This committee Meets regularly twice a week at No. 2, Beaufort Buildings, Strand,’—which you recollect was the place where Thelwall’s lectures were delivered“ where any member delegated by your society will meet with every information required. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12160 You see, therefore, that the prisoner himself states on the istof May, 1794, not that nothing was doing, but on the contrary, that the Committce of Comes ndence and Co-operation, by means of which the whole measure was to be effected, were regularly meeting twice a week in Beaufort Buildings, where any member delegated by this Newcastle Society would meet with every information required. The letter concludes thus—“‘ We inclose you a few of our resolutions, entered into at our general meeting on the 14th of April, which will be sufficiently explanatory of our sentiments and views. We heartily unite with you in wishing that the hydra of tyranny and imposition may soon fallunder the guillotine of truth and reason—repeating the words which had been used by their correspondent. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12161 Gentlemen, intervening transactions had taken place; namely, the proceedings at 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12162 Chalk Farm on the 14th of April, and the proceedings at Sheffield on the 7th of April. You will recollect that the meeting at Chalk Farm was originally intended to have been on the 7th of April, and from this letter it apfears that general meetings at the same time were intended to have been had throughout the whole country. The proceedings at Sheffield, of which we have a very particniar acy count, seems to me to show the whole intent and object of all these men. The person who acted principally there was a Mr. Yorke, whofh you have seen before in the character of delegate trom the Society for Constitutional Information to the convention assembled in Edinburgh, but who never went to that meeting. I believe ill health was the occasion, or perhaps that disapprobation of their measures which he stated in conversation, and of which evidence has heen given. At this meeting at Sheffield Mr. Yorke comments first of all upon a variety of measures, and upon the nature of the government of the country, which were, ax he pppoe, the subjectsin the contemplation of all the persons assembled upon that occasion. These proceedings seem to have been prepared before-hand, and to have been given immediately in the form of a printed paper. He then adverts to that which is adverted'to in the proceedings of the Socicty‘for Constitutional Information, and in those of the Corresponding Society ; the supposed idea of introducing a mercenary army into the country for the purpose of preventing the meeting of the people in convention. He says— It is doing too much honour to innocent subjects to be alarmed ata few pages of writings or ata few fugitive orations, when barracks are erected in a country, and sixty thousand armed mercenaries are ready to execute the mandates of government ; he then states, “ the day is at length arrived when fanaticism and superstition, deprived of their tinsel trappings, and exposed in their native ugliness to the views of mankind, slink scow]ing back to the cave of obscurity. There I hope they will for ever remain. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12163 The use of this language, almost similar to that used in the letter of Hardy which I have before noted to you, shows the general correspondence and communication between those parties, and the manner in which they borrowed, one from the other, the expressions which they made use of. The fanaticism and superstition to which he alludes, are the fanaticism and superstition which include the prejudices which men generally have in favour of the established government of their country. He adds, “ The energy of Englishmen will no ionger endure this strange uproar of injustice. The paper states, that “ the people then came to these resolutions, which resolutions were not heard by, and not knownto, far the greater part of the persons there assembled, and they are stated to have heen adopted with the exception of one or two persons present— “ First, that the people, being the true and only source of government, the freedom of speaking and writing upon any subject cannot be denied to the members of a free government, without offering the it insult to the majesty of the people. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12164 Second, that therefore the condenmatson ofcitizens Muir, Palmer, Skirving, and Gerrald to transportation for exposing the corruptions of the British Government, wx an act better suited to the remains of a despotic than a free government. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12165 “ Third, that the address which has now been read, be presented to the king in behalf of the above persecuted patri dress you: will find at the beginning of the Printed proceedings, and it is one of the 2iGrosses to the king contained im those pe ceedings. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12166 s — next: raoved, that a petition be presented to the House of Commons for a reform in the representation ef the people is a aap but so marked was the disapprotion given by the whole meeting to this measure, that not one single person secended the motion, buta most profound silence, interrupted only by a few murmurs, was observed. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12167 Gentlemen, you will recollect that it is m evidence before you that the motion for a petition to be presented to the House of Com mons was alla contrivance; that it was nos intended that the propriety of presenting any such petition should be seriously bat that it should be brought forward by a persca in concert with this Henry Yorke, merely for the purpose of being rejected. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12168 “Upon which Henry Yorke again arose and addressed the meeting in an aninzated speech of an hour long, and of which it is impossible for us to give our readers a just conception. He took a general view of the British Consttution, and stated its most prominent defects, among which the wantef a perfect national representation was the most glaring. He dwelt a considerable time upon this subject, and then proceeded farther to comment upos it’? He then said, “ It was now high tme that the people should lay aside leaders, ciscard factions, and act for themselves. That the people should lay aside: leaders, discar¢ factions, and act for themselves! In tne first place, when the London Corresponding Society had prepared a petition to the House of Commons, they had applied to Mr. For t present that petition; Mr. Fox told them, “ As the request of my constituents unquestionably I will present this petition; but I tell yor: be fore hand that I totally disapprove of what you propose, universal suffrage annaal per ieneniss ap therefore, I wish you would apply to some other person to present your petition. They must, therefore, have ins pertectly rie at on any petition which they might think proper to present to parliament igen the only grounds on which they stated they would be content (for they mever bars confined themselves within a smaller cosmpes suffrage and angus than requiring universal parliaments) they should be opposed by one of the most able men in this country, and a man who, for a great number of years, has constantly acted in opposition to the king’s ministers. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12169 They then applied to Mr. Francis, who has been examined upon this trial—Mr. Francis says, he told them, explicitly, at the time that they desired him to present their petition, that he likewise disapproved of the prayer of their petition, and that he likewise should Gree it to the utmost of his power. Genlemen, you will recollect, that they cuncealed from Mr. Francis the purpose for which this petition was to be presented. He “was not aware, that they had no serious intention in presenting this petition, and that their object was only to raise discussion and discontent ; that was, in no degree, represented to him, nor were there stated to him a variety of other circumstances respecting the transaction. They likewise knew, that the Society of the Friends of the People would listen to no such measure. The Corresponding Society had artfully enough continued to keep up correspondence with the Society of the Friends of the People, after that society had discarded the society for Constitutional Information, because they saw that the Society for Constitutional Intormation was going to those great lengths, which the Friends of the People Hieatptevest They knew, therefore, that all those persons, who not only were notin the habit of supporting government, but, on the contrary, were in opposition to it; when I say, in support of, and in opposition to government, I mean in support of the administration of the government, and, in opposition to that administration; they knew -that all those persons would oppose that very plan of reform, which those societies meant to introduce. ‘They knew, therefore, that they could not hope to do any thing in pardiament, and that a petition to the House of Commons must necessarily be nugatory, because all parties agreed in thinking, that the plan which they -proposed was inadmissible, and yet they had expressly declared, that they would be content-with nothing less. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12170 Mr. Yorke, therefore, told the people at Sheffield, “1t was now high time that the ste should lay aside leaders, and discard ns, and act for themselves. He strongly enforced these principles, and then entered into a complete detail of the ancient consti‘tution, as established by Alfred, which he proved to be at this-time totally defaced, if Dot lost. He then pursued the gradual decline of popular liberty in England, from the -anarchy which was the consequence of Danish 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12171 Norman invasion, and taking a general -sketch of our history, so far as it was connected withthe subject of popular representation; he made some strong and pointed remarks on the revolution in 1688
SOLICITORGENERAL 12173 Then, gentlemen, he proceeds, in an extremely long speech, to observe upon the effects of that universal emancipation to which he looked; saying, that “ oppressed nature will, at a proper season, depart from passive principles; and should an attempt be made to wrest what remains of liberty from us, I trust all men will concur to vindicate their violated rights ; and he concluded with saying, “ When such a revolution of sentiment shall have dispersed the mists of prejudice ; when, by the incessant thunderings from the press, the meanest cottager: of our country shall be enlightened, and the sux of reason, of which we have heard so much, “ shall shine, in its fullest meridian, over us, then, THE COMMANDING VOICE OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE SHALL RECOMMEND THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTYEIGHTGENTLEMEN IN‘SAINT STEPHEN'S CHAPEL, TO CO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS. Then several resolutions were entered into, one of which was : Convinced of this truth, it is the apinion of this mest that the people ought to demand, asa right, and not petition, as a Savour, for universal representation. —« That, therefore, we will petition the House of Commons no more on this. subject. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12174 It has been attempted to represent this, as meaning, that they would petition the House no more, in the character of separate societies, or individuals; but the resolution is explicit, and clearly shows, that that was not what they meant ;. for, they say, ‘ Convinced of this truth, it is the opinion of this meeting, that the people ought to demand, asa right, and not petition, as a favour, for universal representation: that THEREFORE we will petition the House of Commons no more on this subject. The reason given for petitioning no more, would apply just as much to petitioning, in the form of a number of persons, assembled by delegation, at Edinburgh, or elsewhere, as it would to this meeting at Sheffield
SOLICITORGENERAL 12176 Gentlemen, they speak then of the rejecAion of their petition by the House of Comgnons; and they say, “ Our petition was received with the utmost indignation, by the House of Commons, which was no more than wwe expected ; and, “ although our petition was disdainiully rejected, because not couched in language suthciently polite and respecttul for the tive hundred and fifty-eight gentlemen, whu sit in the House of Commons, yet, believe us, fellow citizens, we are still of opinion, that the matter it contained was not only just and proper, but we think that even the languaye, which gave so much offence to the hon. gentlemen, was much too polite and too muderate for us. For, if the House of Commons were the real representatives of the people, we certainly had a right to dictate and not to petition. You will find, throughout the whole of this transaction, that they had Now assumed, that they had a right to dictate, end not to petition
SOLICITORGENERAL 12178 They conclude : “ But our petition being the country ; and therefore holding principles rfectly inconsistent with the present esty flishment of the British government. Gentlemen, there are many other passages which might be observed upon, but I a afraid I have already infinitely too Jong tres passed upon your patience. There is ow subject upon which I have hitherto seid bu little; I mean the subject of arming. I could wish, also, if I had strength for the pi ealng to say something to you upon the subject of Chalk-farm ; but I am realty unable to doa. With respect to the subject of arming, asit assedat Sheffield, what does it show? That, some means, the minds of the people st Sheffield, T mean of the people who belonged to these societies, were impressed with idea, that some civil commotion was to beer pected, and that it was, therefore, necessary for them to provide themselves with arms for their defence; and I will take it, that thos witnesses who have appeared here, spoke perfectly seriously when they said they meant these arms only for their own defence. Bat the purpose of Yorke, Davison, and Gale, who are the only three persons who appear scouted, we shall trouble them no more with our coarse and unmannerly language; it -will be our duty to proceed, as we have uniformly done hitherto, in enlightening the public mind, and when a complete revolution of sentiment shall take place (as will shortly be the case) in our country, we shall open our mouths in that key we think most agreeable 0 ourselves ; and our voice, together with that of our disfranchised countrymen, will resemble, perhaps, the thunderings from Mount Sinai. Clearly alluding to the idea, that the opinion of the people, supporting a convention, assembled and acting as a convention of the peuple, speaking, therefore, under that character, the public will, as described in Barrere’s specch, would be irresistible; and that its thunderings would be in that key which the Persons who composed it should think most agrecable to themselves, and would resemble the thunderings of Mount Sinai. Then they speak of their principles, and say, “ These essential principles are both easy and comprehensive. On these we build our right to representation, and renvunce the idcu of future petitions. So that they cleatly renounce the idea of future petitions, not simply from themselzcs, but from any other persons, assuming their title to universal representation, as a right, and Not as a thing to be obtaincd by petition : By these maxims we find that every Englishman is free, and that in the clection of a Supreme magistrate, or in the delegation of leBislatiwe powers, he concedes his actions to a certain superintendence, for the express purse of preventing liberty from vaulting over its imits, ‘und introducing a system of universal Niolence, injury, or licentiousness ;—applyin Election to the supreme magistrate, as wall Bs to every other part of the government of have been active persons upon the occasion, was as completely answered, whether nt had armed those men for the purpose of defence, or any other purpose whatever. They had armed them with a weapon, cheaply and easily obtained, and easily used; they very well, likewise, that which appeared upoa the examination, I think, of one of the wit nesses for the defendant, that ten thousand such arms might, at Sheffield, be fabricated in a day; so that it was unnecessary that the actual fabrication of arms should be immediately thought of. Nothing more was wanting than to put the people in a train, for the pupose of obtaining arms when they should be wanted, The ie thingnny al y with res; to what passed in 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12179 As to Tee letter from Davison, itis Drogo clear, although we cannot trace the fact, thst it had been communicated by the prisoner, a some way or other ; otherwise Edwards sev could have known, that the prisoner was tle person to apply to, for a direction where get arms at Sheffield. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12180 Gentlemen, ata much earlier period, the persons concerned in this transaction, looked upon what was going forward, as leading to extreme anarchy—I allude more particularly to the letter of Skirving, of the 5th of July, 1793, to the prisoner at the ba, a which he clearly and explicitly states, whst his ideas upon the subject were. In wnitiag that letter of the 5th of July, 1793, Mr. Skix ving had it in his contemplation that, by pr sibility, in a very short time, the whole cou try might be in anarchy and confusion. Be says—“ If we sought only the extirpaix of one set of interested men from the 1 ment of national affairs, that place mightgiven to another set, without affecting Uvitals adverse to the system of reform, bet might be easily aceomplished; but to cut up deep and wide rooted prejudices, to give effectual energy to the dictates of truth, in favour of public virtue and national prosperity, in opposition to self, and all its interested habits, and to withstand, and overawe the final efforts of the powers of darkness, is the work of the whole, and not of a part; a work to which maokind, till this awful period, were never adequate, because never till now disposed to fraternize ; not merely or only, I trust, from the sense of the common danger to which we are exposed, but from the ennobling principle of universat benevolence. I think the minds of all must, in the nature of thin turned to more effectual means of reform— not one person was convinced of the necessity of it by the most convincing arguments of reason, together, with the most uneqnivocal expressions of universal desire. hat then is to be hoped for from repetition? I am only afraid that the bow in England, against refornt, was so contracted, that in returning it may break. You would willingly learn, you say, from us; I own that we ought to be forward in this. We have at once in great wisdom perfected our plan of organization, and it we were in the same independent state of mind as the people of England, we should be able to take the lead. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12181 He proceeds to observe upon the consequences of that plan of organization, which he says has been established, and the object of which was, to effect the reforms which he had proposed. He adds—“ The associations with you are no more, I fear—excuse my freedom —than an aristocracy for the good of the people. They are indeed moderate, firm, and virtuous; and better cannot be: but we are the people themselves, and we are the first to show that the people can both judge and reSolve, if undirected by faction, with both wisdom and moderation. I have not a higher wish in the present exertions for reform, than to see the people universally and regularly associated, because I am persuaded that the present disastrous engagements will issue in ruin, and the people then must provide for themselves; and it would be unhappy, when we should be ready to act with unanimity, to beoccupied about organization, without which, however, anarchy must ensue. What can this advert to but a contemplation in the mind of Skirving, so early as the 25th of May, 1793, that things were approaching to such a state, in this country, that there would be a dissolution of the whole of the existing govern ment; and, if some other government was Not provided in its place, that anarchy must ensue? “ Let us, therefore, (says he) “ take the hint given us by our opposers. Let us begin in earnest to make up our minds relative to the extent of reform which we ought to seek, to’ be prepared to justify it, and to Controvert objections, Let us model the whole in the public mind. Let us provide avery stake and stay of the tabernacle which we would erect ; so that when the tabernacles of oppression, in the palaces of ambition, are broken down under the madness and folly of their supporters, we may then, without anarchy and all dangerous delay, erect at once our tabernacle of righteousness, and may the Lord himself be in it. e 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12182 Now, gentlemen, here is a man contem plating that which was likely to be the result of the measures in which he was en, vseeing they led to anarchy and confusion, and exhorting other persons to be prepareth for the event, by providing a plan for that new i government which he meant to establish, inbe now stead of the government which he meant to destroy. He then proceeds to describe what was the unfortunate state of the Roman government, after the nations which had been subjected by it, had been left “ like sheep without a shepherd clearly alluding to that state of anarchy wiich at that period prevail. ed in Europe; a state described in history so forcibly, and picturing so completely, in many instances, the present situation of France, that really when one reads that history, one almost imagines one is reading the history of the present state of France. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12183 The letter proceeds—“ We may suppose an event which we deprecate. Nay, should we not be prepared for every possible issue, at the present unprecedented divisions of mankind? we have a right to be apprehensive of the abilities ofour own managers, who are so afraid to depart from precedent, that like men of detail, they may be inadequate to the task of preserving the vessel from shipwreck, now grappling with danger, not only great, but new and uncommon. The letter adds—“ if the present ministry fail, who after them shall be trusted? It requires little penetration to see the anarchy and discord which will follow. It will be such, that nothing short of a general union among the people themselves, will be able to heal. Haste therefore to associate, at least to be ready to associate. If then such a broken state of things should take place, the civil broils that would necessarily ensue would soon subside, before the united irresistible voice of the whole. Do not, I intreat you, hesitate thinking such a work premature as yet; but 2 month, and then it may be too late. The sp pcensian upon this man’s mind, unquestionably, was extremely strong—an impression not at all, indeed, warranted by the event; his idea was, that the danger was then great —he looked to the gencral dissolution of government—he looked to anarchy and discord —he looked to civil broils as necessarily ¢nsuing; and the only hope he had, was in the united irresistible voice of the whole adopting some plan, to be actually formed, and ready to be offered to them upon the instant. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12184 Gentlemen, this letter clearly shows, that that sort of civil discord had been long in the contemplation of these parties. Whether they ever took those means to provide for the contingencies which might happen, which the writer of this letter recommends, it is impossible for us to know. All that I can observe is, that if you look into the report of the Committee of Constitution of the London Corresponding Society, I think you will find a sort of provision, not adapted merely to the purposes of a private society, but easily convertible to the purposes of a nation actin ynder the ideas which these societies had o} the proper manner of governing a country. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12185 Gentlemen, I will make one short remark m what passed at Chalk Farm, principally with a view to call to your attention the very violent resolutions which were intended to have been adopted at that meeting, by one of the parties—I likewise would call to your attention, that the system of arming appears to have been, in some degree, adopted throughout, as to what was said with respect to the knives it certainly was a trifling circumstance, but the fact is not contradicted, and I would particularly remark to you, that a pergon of the name of Pearce, was named specifically in the evidence of Groves (whose evidence is the only evidence that has been in any degree materially affected) as one of the peswns who were present at the transaction. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12186 might have appeared and contradicted -that assertion ; he has not appeared and contradicted that assertion, he therefore must be taken, from his silence upon this occasion, to have assented to the eth of that assertion. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12187 I would likewise observe, that Green, the man who in some respects contradicts Groves, was called on the pee of the crown; and I think that you will believe, that those who had the management of this business on the part of the crown, when they called that man, had no idea of concealing from you an’ circumstance of which they could obtain evidence for your information. He likewise himself, upon his cross-examination, admitted something which might give some sort of colour to the evidence of Groves—but. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12188 Gentlemen, put out of your consideration all the evidence that Groves has given—put out of your consideration these knives, and a thousand other little trifling circumstances— you will find all the parol evidence given, confirmed by the written papers—you will find not one word of that parol evidence contradicted, except so far as the evidence of Green, one of the witnesses on the part of the crown, contradicts the evidence of Groves, another witness on the part of the crown, in this single circumstance—at the same time that hundreds and hundreds of people might have contradicted the test part of tl 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12189 1 evidence which has been given, if it had en thought safe for the prisoner to bring those persons to the bar. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12190  You will likewise recollect the paper of the Ins and Outs, which was certainly an incitement to arm, exactly upon the same principle es that which was proceeded upon at Sheffield, ineiting the people to provide arms for self-defence—the persons who 36 inciaj them, having no reason whatever for incitiag them to arm, for any particular object, at thir moment, but simply for the purpose of pre viding with arms the persons whom they meant afterwards to make use of, and having the power to refrain from telling them the application which they meant to make df them, till the moment when it would be oo venient for them to do so. 
SOLICITORGENERAL 12191 Gentlemen, I have addressed you beyood my strength
SOLICITORGENERAL 12193 at you will give it with jor. —If it should compel you to give a contuy verdict ; bitter though the cup may be, you may not passit from you. You have a solem duty to perform ; you must tax own feel. ings; you must perform it. I have had a dut which T have found not only difficult to but painful to my own fee nee T have et deavoured to discharge it faithfully. Having done so, I will now trouble you no longer. 
EYRE 12194 We are at the seventh day of this trial ; and it comes tom now to sum up this great and momentos cause. Is it expected or wished, on the pat of the prisoner particularly, , and also oa the part of the prosecutor, that the whole of ths written evidence should be repeated to be jury? or, would it be satisfactory to eve ly, that the parol evidence only should be summed up to the jury, that they should be left to their recollection of the written ev dence, together with the production of st parts of the written evidence, as, 0 course of the summing up, it may appet to me to be necessary to have recourse to If it is at all the wish of the prisoner in pert cular, or the counsel for the prisoner, orif is insisted upon on the part of the prosecutt, I shall not at all regret the expense of my time, or bodily fatigue, as far as it may be a cessary for me personally to go through it— would willingly spare the jury, if I could, cause their labour has been infinite; amd, I were to gu through the whole of the wn evidence, I am very apprehensive that should only load them with an imperfet collection of a mass of evidence, which, If! were stated again to them, they wouldatruth be less prepared to receive the at tions that I shall make upon those pets the evidence that appear tome tobei. 
ATTORNEYGENERAL 12195 On the pest rosecution, it appears to me, that I cannot tter consult the interest of the public, than to leave the execution of this uty to that discretion which presides here.

EYRE 12209 Forthe present, gentlemen, you will attend to the evidence, with a view only to the establishment of some or other of tliose facts which ase so charged as overt acts, the general effect ef the evidence I shall take occasion to state to you, with observations upon it, when I come to state. the whole of the evidence together. 
EYRE 12210 The first witness that was called, after the written evidence was in a great measure gone through, was William Camage, who said, he was a member of the society at Sheffield; that he became so the latter end of the year 1791; that he acted as secretary, he believes, five or six months ; he ceased to act in that capacity about the latter end of April or May last—he used to sign the letters, which were often written by others—the business of the society was managed by different persons—there was acommittee—the leading persons of the committee were one David Martin, who used to attend the committee ; John Allcock, George Widdison and Matthew Lodwin—they were 
EYRE 12211 ‘sons concerned in writing these letters— thatthe professed object they had in view, was a parliamentar felon thee they chose Matthew Campbell Brown a delegate to the Scotch Convention, and that he was sent to Brown at Edinburgh, by the Society to carry him cash. He says, there was, at first, a parliamentary reform proposed to be brought about by petition to parliament. Being asked what was theirnext measure, supposing peed ieee was rejected, he said, he never heard any other specific plan, proposed by Mr. Yorke, or pointed out by him. He says, the society was threatened to be dispersed in their meetings, by the people of Sheffield, by the opposite party; that they thought it necessary that they should have arms for their own defence; and he approved of it; he did not see any harm in the business; but they had a right to be armed for their own defence, against any illegal attack from that party, and to protect their meetings; this, he said, was the gencral idea amongst a great many, whose names he could not mention at present, he says, Mr. Yorke approved the idea. He was shown the blade ofa pike ; he said, it was shown to Mr. Yorke by Henry Hill, who is here as a witness, who is a shoemaker's knife forger ; as well ashe recollects, it was Hill who made that blade of the pike ; 
EYRE 12212 arms, and nothing of arms in any other coz. try; he said, he did not know of any quanutr being made, excepting three dozen, whi: were made, he believes, by Hiil; he sx. he saw a pike handle at Widdison’s; : was about eight or nine o'clock at night, wie: he went to Yorke’s about it; that no pen: was pregent. 
EYRE 12213 He says, he was at the meeting upc tix Castle Hill, at Sheffield; that, at that tm:, there was no recommendation of arms. He says, he knew Davison, who was servantGale; and he also knew Robert Moody. Yorte recommended, that parliament should not be petitioned ; he heard of an addre-s to te people; he says, that Yorke was drawn hex in a carriage, without horses ; be heard Yor disapprove of the Scotch Convention ; fa k thought the people were very much uoprjared. P Hc proves a letter produced, to be «dk Davison’s hand, addressed to Hardy, and th: he had seen it m Davison’s possesswn s: Sheftield. Davison, he says, came origins from Leeds ; and he acted as secretary ? Lecds. Le says, he desired thata letter fm Hardy might be directed to Moody; and ix eaid, the proper secretary’s name, wich Broomhead, was struck out, because the thought some letters to the secretary had bee: intercepted. He said, Moody put handles three ten pikes; they were somewhert about seven feet long, made of fir ; the blak about ten inches ; they were about the sim shape as a bayonet, fluted and pointed ; ther were none shafted, that he knew of, of a0 other shape; one was mide betore, which was not of that shape ; and, as well as be re collects it, that one was shown to Yorke. He said, that Davison is gone off. He is asked to a night cat; he says, he knows what its: it stands four ways; the use of it he sys & to act against cavalry, by being thrown wl the strect
EYRE 12215  threatened with interruptions in March, 1794; he never heard that the proposed convention was, to pnt down the king and the parliament, and to take upon themselves the functions of government; the Sheffield Society thought that the Scotch Convention would petition, and that the House of Commons would attend to the application of a large number when a small number of individuals might be neglected; that he should have thought himself the most abandoned of mankind, if he had continued a member of the society, if they had taken up such sentiments ; he said, he had never any reason to believe that there was an intent to destroy the constitution. He said, they were afraid of the opposite party making an attack upon them; they thought what they were doing was legal; they had no intention of arming against the king and parliament; he would not have remained another day in that society, if that had been the use intended to be le of these arms; but he thought they had a right to have arms for theit own defence, upon the Bill of Rights, against any of those people that might attack them: Yorke said it was so. He could not take upon himself to tell what the delegates of the convention meant to do. - He believes it was the cheaphess of the article that recommended the pikes. As to the cat, he did not know that any were made from the model ; he had seen some years ago, something of that kind at Neweastle; and, as he recollects, as to the time, it was some time about the American war; the letter alluded to in this man’s evidence, is addressed to “ Citizen Hardy, No. 9 Piccadilly, London. “ Fellow Citizen ; the barefaced aristocracy of the present administration has made it necessary that we should be prepared to act on the defensive, against any attack they may command their 1ewly-armed minions to make upon us. A pian has been hit upon, and if encouraged sufficiently, will, no doubt, have the effect, of furnishing a quantity of pikes to the patriots great enough to make them formidable, the blades are made of steel tempered and polished after an approved form ; they may be fixed into any shafts, but fir ones are recommended of the girt of the accompanying hoops at the top, and about an inch more at the bottom; the blades and hoops, more than which cannot be properly sent to any great distance, will be charged one shilling; money to be sent with the orders. As the institution is in its infancy, immediate eNcouragement is necessary. They have strvek nut “ Orders may be sent to the secretary of the Shetheld Constitutional Society.

EYRE 12217 o pet post suspicion, direct to Mr. Robert Moody, joiner, Cheney Square, Sheffield. Please to forward the enclosed. 
EYRE 12218 The witness ssys, Davison might have the same views for the people in London as the witness had in Sheffield; he says the pikes would cost about twenty pence. Being asked if he ever heard of such a place as the Parrot in Green Arbour Allev, London, he says he does not know any thing ofit. 
EYRE 12219 The next witness is William Broomhead, he is a cutler at Sheffield, and was a member of the Constitutional Society there at its first institution in 1791; he says he did not know that he was one of the twelve who were associated with the London Constitutional Society ; he has some idea of a letter having been written that they might act in conjunction, but never heard of the association ; he was secretary of the society in Sheffield for the last five months before he was apprehended, which was in April; he says the object of the society was a parliamentary reform, by meeting and endeavouring to enlighten each other, and to spread the knowledge of grievances, that they might unitedly apply in the most unexceptionable mode for a teform of parliament; the term universal suffrage he did not hear of till the Edinburgh Convention; he says he knows Yorke, w sometimes goes by anothcr name, by the name of Redhead, he resided at Sheffield several times ; he cannot tell exactly how long, the last time might be six, seven, or eight weeks. The witness knows Gale; he says Yorke used to attend the weekly mectings during his last visit at Sheffield, but he was not a settled inhabitant of the place ; that he was considered as a man of considerable abilities, and an orator, and treated with respect ; he said he wrote several pamphlets at Sheffield; he used to bring parts of them to be read to the society at these meetings. 
EYRE 12220 The society held these meetings in a small and in a large room; there was an elevation for the speaker, which some called the pulpit, some the tribune; from this tribune Mr. Yorke addressed the society. He was at the meeting upon the Castle-hill, Mr. Yorke was there, and expatiated very largely upon the corruptions which had crept into the constitution, or rather the evils complained of; he says his manner of speaking sometimes carried him farther than he ought, he was peculiarly energetic, fiery, very warm, very strong, but that he said nothing contrary to the law and constitution. 
EYRE 12221 He says it was settled ata previous meeting, that he the witness, should make a motion for a petition to the House of Commons, in order that it might be over-ruled, for the purpose of introducing another motion in its place ; he says he made his motion and it was objected to, with a view to the introducing another; he says there were four of them of the committee, himself and three more—that: several people were assembled ; the new motion was, to petition his majesty, it was drawn up before they assembled, for a reform in parliament; that Mr. Yorke addressed the people, that the petition was sent to London to earl Stanhope, but he did not think fit to] “ O Thou whose awful word can bind resentit; they afterwards agreed that Mr.| ‘“‘ The raging waves, the raging wind, orke’s specch should be printed; it was| “ Mad tyrants tame, break down the higt. printed and published at Sheflield; a printed} ‘ Whose haughty foreheads beat the sky; copy was shown to the witness, he believes . that which is now produced eae one; there Makcehare tine arm, great King of King, were some, he says, to be had at Mr. Gale’s an shop; he : says at their private meetings phat wonder-working arm whick broke

The distribution inte divisions, or sections, was not regularly kept; that they were to meet as they thought proper; but that they were to cullect a penny a week each, to ake a fund; he says, that that part of the business was not properly attended to; the district mectings were nvt regularly and properly attended to

EYRE 12240 I thought it necessary that the whole of this paper should be read, because the paper has been very much relied upon in the cause, and because different constructions have been put upon it by the counsel in support of the prosecution, and by the counsel on the part of the prisoner: the importance of it is not drawn so much from its general extravagance, as it is from the particular circumstance that it purports to resulve, that the body that were then assembled at Sheffield, would petition parliament no more, and would try some other course; what was meant by petitioning parliament no more, and what was meant by trying some other course, will be a sulject for your deliberations when you take this paper, with all the circumstances that preceded it, and that followed it, keeping in your minds, that this is a paper which was published among a very numerous set of people, assembled at Shefheld, just about the time that the proposition for a convention of the people was under consideration, in a committee of correspondence and co-operation of the two societics, the Constitutional and Corresponding Societies, in London, and that this paper was found in the hands of Hardy, the prisoner at the bar, the secretary of one of these societies; at present, I make no farther observation upon this paper, only recommendin; 
EYRE 12241 to you, as far as you can, to keep the genera! import of it in your minds, that you may understand the application of it, when it comes to be examined hereafter, on both sides. 
EYRE 12242 The original examination of Broomhead was finished by reading these papers; he was then cross-examined; he said there was a hand-bill circulated for the purpose, as he supposed, of exciting the people against the society; it was a call to the people to arm against foreign and domestic enemies; that the adverse party to him, aud his friends, at Sheffield, had given out, that they should be able to do nothing with him, nor his party, the society, till they could cause a riot; that, from this, he understood, that arms came to be talked of; that it was to oppose illegal force, such as had been used at Birmingham, and at Manchester; such as was against the law of the land; he says, Gale had, in his hand, the hand-bill, at the time they were talking of arms; and there were several resolves printed, in his paper, the week following, being a direct answer to it, mentioning something upon the matter. 
EYRE 12243 Being asked, if any of the people in this society to which he belonged, bad any idea of making any attack upon the king, or the House of Lords, or had any idea of altering the government, in that respect; he says, it was as much his intention to fly to the sun; he says, his object was, to enlighten the people; to show them the ground of all their complaints and sufferings, when a person worked for twelve hours a day, and could not get a living ; that was what he understood of it; their object was parliamentary reform; as such they corresponded with the Society of the Friends of the People, as well as the Constitutional Society; he says, he would not have been a member of this society, if there had been any idea like that of attacking the King, or the House of Lords; he does not think there was such a wicked man among them; that parliamentary reform, in the House of Commons, was their object; that the idea was, that King, Lords, and Commons might, with the concurrence of the nation, make a reform; that no one, in Sheffield, doubted but that the object was, to attain this pereetys and that there was no intent, to is knowledge, to use any force. Then he added, what wicked people might have done, in that case, he could not answer for; he says, he would not have sent a man there, as a delegate, if he had supposed he would not have acted peaceably. 
EYRE 12244 When he was re-examined, he was asked as to one Ashton, who had been secretary to their society; he said, they might have sent, for aught he knew, to the Friends of the People, to say, that they would have no more to do with them; and it might have been discussed in their meeting, whether they would have any more to do with them, be cause they were not fit for their purpose. Gentlemen, you will find, in the course of the correspondence here, a letter, which bad been written by this society, after they had correr ponded with the Society the Friends of the People, written to the London Correspondi or Constitutional Society, in which they say, that they did not care to have any thin more to do with that society, the Friendsa the People, not thinking them honest, He says, he does not know of a resolutica being come to, to write that letter; it might have been after he was gone ; he says he took some part in the debate, and does not believe that they, the Society of the Friends of the People, were honest; that though they bed promised to use all constitutional means, they were not satisfied with them; this might be about the twenty-sixth of May, 1792. After the hand-bill had been published, he says they published a counter advertisement, asd they took the same words in their counter advertisement, as had been taken in thi hand-bill, and had it inserted in Gale's calling upon the people to arm against invaders, and domestic enemies. 
EYRE 12245 He was asked, as he says they had ben threatened, whether, before they armed, they had applied to any magistrate ; he says, na. He states that Gale and Yorke, two of the active members of this society, proposed these papers, and that the society winked at ther doing it; by which he meant to convey, that they were more violent than they should have been; that they winked at their doing it, a having a good opinion of them, says, that the resolution respecting landing of He sian troops, was passed long before this baad bill; he knows nothing of the intelligence that was sent at the time to the London Corresponding Society, by Davison, nor beard any thing of it, till he was informed of it at his examination before the privy covodl He says, he cannot answer for every body was in this society; there wight be wicked men among all bodies; that as to this Davison, if he sent the letter, it was without his knowledge. There were then read tions of the date of the twenty-first of Marcb, 1794, of the Constitutional Society, and of the twentieth of March, of the London Cores ponding Society, returning their thanks for the lecture, and the proceedings, uj the Fast-day ; and the witness says, that the lecture was re-printed in London, in the yeat 1794. 
EYRE 12246 The next witness is Henry Alexander; be was a member of the London Corresponding Society, belonging to the division which met at Robins’s coffee-house, Shire-lane: thst be was the ninety-fifth member of that division; he became a member in November, 1195, Yorke also was a member of that society; he remembers Yorke being them when the 1000 
EYRE 12247 was quite full; there were between sixty and a on people; that Yorke took his leave of the society by a speech ;:that he talked of going to some place, which he called Bel-gsum; that he understood him, he was to head the French army, and that they would be ripe fur a revolution by Christmas; what was really said, how this man must have misunderstood, we cannot very well guess, but to be sure it could not have passed exactly as he understands ; and what he meant by, “ they would be ripe for a revolution by Christmas ; whether he meant, that the ap of the world, where he was poing, would be ripe for a revolution, or whether he meant, when he came home, they would be ripe for a revolution, does not at all appear, by this man’s evice, any way that you can depend upon; but, he adds, that he hoped to come to London, at the head of them ; that is, I suppose, the French; and he talked of having the honour of being a member of the convention, in France ; he hoped he should come at their head, hither; that the society would join them; that Mr. Pitt’s, the other ministers’, and the king’s heads, should be upon Temple Bar; that the king and queen of France had met with what they deserved; that the Sans Culotes were a set of brave fellows; and he hoped, when he came, that the society would not sbrink from what they pretended to be; he said, it was impossible to do any thing without some bloodshed ; he said, that there were a set of brave men at Shefiield. 
EYRE 12248 He says, that the night before this conversation , there was a ian at the meeting, who came from Sheffield, who said there were pikes at Sheffield, at six-pence a piece ; another man answered, that it would be right to have some; it would only be living upon bread and cheese for one day. After this the witness says, he went and discovered what he knew to Mr. ‘Dundas, and: the lord mayor, for he thought it was proper government should be let into the light of it; he was first asked to go to their place by a friend of his, one Smith, a delegate; he was asked to be made a member; he was there seven times in all; and this is the whole of his evidence. You see the substance of it is, he gives an account of a ve extravagant conversation, supposed to have been held by this Yorke, at the meeting ; what you will make of it, is for you to judge, 
EYRE 12249 Upon his cross-examination, he says he was a linen draper; he resides now at the Rose, in the Fleet Market; that it was at the latter end of the year, 1793, when a friend asked him to go with him to one of those divisions; that Whitehorn said Smith had asked him; that Smith, Ashley, and Baxter, were there; that nothing happened to offen him that night; some papers were read; Whitehorn bad belonged to a Society in Holborn, which. the witness did not know till afterwards; ‘that, for his-part, he never wished fox a reform in parliament; he said, that he had read a which. they gave him, to two or three of his friends; he said, he went the second time to see what they were upon; that he had not, at the first time, been desired to po but that he had been twice after he had en at Mr. Dundas’s; he says, they all shook hands with Yorke at parting. 
EYRE 12250 He says, he is not now in employment, and has not been since May; he hed been a few months at Mr. Kellerby’s, in Finsbury-square, who was a linen draper then; he has since let his shop to another person, and carries on the tayloring business; he had been before at Mr. Faulder’s, a linen draper’s, in Holborn, almost two years; he says, he was lately engaged with a Mr. Marley, in Holborn; he left him on Friday last, telling him he was going out of town; the reason, he says, for’ 
EYRE 12251 loing that was, that he thought of going to Sheffield, and it would not be convenient to pretend to remain in place, when he could not stick tu it. He was asked, what passed the other nights ; he says, he has no particularremembrance of any thing; but the third or fourth night he saw Yorke; ie heard Yorke say, he been to Newgate to see Mr. Frost; he never heard Yorke mention any thing about pikes, and he says, he does not ‘ think Yorke was at the meeting the night that the pikes were talked of. 
EYRE 12252 Gentlemen, if much depended upon the credit of this witness, there certainly are some observations that go to his discredit, upon this cross-examination ; at the same time he is not contradicted as to the facts which he hassworn, by any person that comes from the division ; it is not possible to say, that his evidence is not to have re; paid to it, having regard to it, still you will take it with those allowances that you ought to make for an account of the sort that this man has given, which is notvery correct, and not very intelligible, in every part of it; it does seem, upon the whole, if his evidence is to be depended upon, that Yorke was at this meeting; that he was then going somewhere, and he talked extravagantly, and of coming to London to head a revolution, sometime about Christmas, and hoping the society would join with him, when he did come; what is to be the effect of that upon the whole of the case, you are to judge. 
EYRE 12253 Thomas Whitehorn says, he is shopman to’ a bookseller; he became a member of the London Corresponding Society the same evening with the last witness; he says, he was there four times; he saw Yorke there once; there might be from forty to sixty people; another says, I think, from sixty to a hundred ; the room was full; Yorke seemed to be very well known; he made a very long speech ; he heard him speaking very loud; what it was, he could say nothing at all to, but he did understand something of his going abroad; he himself had lived with Mr. Owen, in Fleetstreet; afterwards he went to a Mr. Bagster, in the Strand; he saw Alexander after this, but that he himself left the society, having changed his situation, and it not being convenient to him to attend. You see he does not confirm the last witness, as to any thing Yorke said, but does confirm him as to the fact, that he was present when Yorke was resent, and when he made a speech, and that fe said he was going abroad. 
EYRE 12254 The next witness is George Widdison; he is a hair dresser and turner, at Sheffield; he says he has been a member of the society, at Sheffield, abuut two years; he saw Yorke there, at a meeting in Queen-street, not long after the execution of the king of France; he saw him at the Castle-bill, in the month of April; he used to dress his hair. It was the eneral talk uf the town, at the time the arms Bras began making, and he made a dozen of pike shafis for Gale; that Yorke inquired when they were mace; when he had finished one, he carried it to Yorke, and asked him, if it would du; he said, yes; he touk about a dozen and a half; that Mr. Wilkinson took them; he understood they were to be used in their own defence. Yorke used to say, he wanted universal suffrage, and that the sucicty were all for that; he says, there was not much disputing about the mode; that some weeks before Yorke left Sheffield, he (the witness) disagreed with him about this universal suffrage; he told him he thought the plan would not do, that they would carry it too far; to which Yorke said, “ I have studied it, and nothing else will do: he says, that there it ended; they differed in sentiment, and had no more conversation about it —he said, he expected to be paid for the pike handles by the people who took them. 
EYRE 12255 Upon his cross-examination, he said—that he was a friend, in general, to the king—that the society, in general, were—that he would Not have continued in the society if he thought they were not—that the first notion they had of universal suffrage was taken from the duke of Richmond's plan, which was read in the society, and generally approved of—he never understoud that it was meant to do any thing by force—that he did not think the people’s minds were prepared for it (by which 1 understand him tv mean, prepared for the plan)— be thought at first that it might be done without tumult or comtuotion, but that he had changed his mind. 
EYRE 12256 Hie says, he was with the society at the time of the Scotch Convention, and should have voted for the delegates, but he happened not to come in time—he understood that the convention would petition parliament, and address the nation—he said that a petition would come with more force, but he did not understand that the object of the convention was, to assume the functions of parliament; he would not have been a party to it if he had so understood—he considered himself and the society as altached to the king, and was of opinion, that the king’s preservation and the people’s liberties were inseparable—there was nothing said of arnss to attack the king and overnment—he does not know that he ever eard arms mentioned in the society—that he made a pike for himself, which he thougtt necessary—that there was not a very good understanding between the two parttes io the town, and that this precaution was taken against people who might come without lezaj authority from the magistrate. 
EYRE 12257 He says, that he had been threatened m different companies—that the aristocrats, 3 they called thein, said, if there was an invasiva they would destroy their enemies at home first, as the French did: to which the wit ness replied, that he hoped there was not any such idea; that if there was, they showd arm themselves in their own defence; aad therefore they thought it necessary to arm themselves. He said, that the House of Lords never made a part of their conversation; he had no thought of any reformation of that sort—he says, that Yorke was a man apt get warm in conversation, he had heard him speak, but he had noreason to believe that be was not well-affected to the king—with regard to Davison’s letter, he knew nothing ot it; and he admits that he was onc of the membezs who gave thanks to Mr. Paine. ‘ 
EYRE 12258 This is the first witness you have who speaks of this plan of reform, and what the origin of it was; and to be sure itis a lesson to men of high rank and consequence in the community, and who have situations .in which they may debate and promulgate their opinions upoa the political state of the country, how they cominit them to the press in the way in which this was committed; the consequence of which is, that itis in the power of any maa to disperse them to any extent: by whic& means they find their way into the hands of Persons tvo often unequal to the task of examining and discussing such topics, and they become by that means the source of infiuite mischief to the community—and, if this is the general history of this plan of reform, that has thus found its way imto the minds of the lower orders of the peuple, it is, say, alesson that I think men of rank and property ought never to forget. 
EYRE 12259 Gentlemen, the next witness was Henry Hill, a cutler at Shetfield.—He says, he was a member of this society in the year 1792
EYRE 12261 Upon his cross-examination he says, he would not have been a member if he thought they intended to oppose the king; he never heard any declarations of that sort at Sheffield ; the society always appeared friendly to the king; for any thing he saw by them he Tever saw any thing to make him think the contrary; all they wanted was, a more equal representation in the Commons House of Parliament: they followed the duke of Richmond’s plan—there were some pikes prepared, on account of the opposite party using such threats; that they have come in the dead of the. mght; they called the place where he was Jacobin hall, and they called them levellers and Jacobins—there were an armed set of People who paraded the street, and fired into people’s houses; when going home at twelve ’clock at night, they have shot under a person’s door—he says, that they never intended to attack the magistrates —he knows nothing at all of the vote of thanks to Paine. 
EYRE 12262 The next witness, Robert Moody, is a joiner, who also lives at Sheffield, and wasa member of this society—He says, they had district meetings, division meetings he knew Henry Yorke, he was sometimes chairman; he saw him at the meeting upon the Castle Hill; he thinks there were not fewer than ten thousand people assembled ; that the populace drew Yorke home; that Camage was there reading some resolutions, which he saw afterwards in the Sheffield newspaper; that Broomhead acted as secretary
EYRE 12264 Gentlemen, you see, here is a vote of ten thousand people obtained in this manner; and it is a remarkable circumstance, that the motion for petitioning parliament was concerted to be rejected in the meeting of the junto before they came there. This gives us an excellent idea of what a debate in such an assembly as that must be. 
EYRE 12265 The witness says, that Broomhead was secretary at this meeting—that Camage brought him four or five pikes, and bespoke. three dozen of handles; that the blades were brought afterwards for the whole ; that he did not inguire what they were for, nor did he know who they were for; that Camage said aman of the name of Davison was to take them from him; that he was to be paid ready money for them when they were done. 
EYRE 12266 —He remembers a report that they were to be used against people by whom they "y posed they might be illegally attacked; for report, and only report as he knew of, had said they should be dispersed—They had met frequently in large meetings, and many of opposite principles said they should be dispersed ; and that very likely they might. get some authority from the justice of the peace, for that a little might procure that; and they got these arms to defend themselves if they should be illegally attacked
EYRE 12268 He says, that the division, number twentytwo, met at the Three Tuns, Snow Hill, one evening, there were about sixteen of them, he was one (this was before the anniversary dinner); it had been proposed to the members to meet there to form an association like the Lambeth Association, but that no person agreed to it. 
EYRE 12269 He says, he understood that there was a secret committee, for the management of some affairs of this society; that this had been dissolved
EYRE 12271 The witness says, he was some time a dele‘gate; he attended the general committee of lelegates about six times; the delegates returned all the new members; that they had met dt Compton street, they were removed afterwards to Beaufort Buildings, to Thelwall’s
EYRE 12273 He says he was present at the theeting at Chalk-farm; that the meeting was to have been held in Store-street, Tottenham-court
EYRE 12274 [isig road, but they went from thence to Chalk. farm; the witness had a card, or ticket, fx his admissien, which he procured from the committee of the Corresponding Societs, Compton-street, on the Thursday night pre ceding the meeting at Chalk- farm; that Mr. Addington, a justice of the peace, prevented their meeting in Store-street; he supposes there were two thousand persons, or upwards, at Chalk-farm ; a person stoud at the doer to take the tickets; he tore the tickets in half; he kept one half, the other half was put in their hats
EYRE 12276 This is undoubtedly a most infamous ani detestable paper; what it points at is to plain to be mistaken; and how it is possibk it should have happened that a man who prefesses to have an object which he thinks lavudable, and other people may agree that be may think it laudable, should have disgrace? himself by the publication of such a paper ss this, is hard to smyself but whether it fairly cennects with the subject of the present Indictment, soas fairly to heinterwoven into the cunspiracy with which this pri8oner is charged, is another consideration, which you will weg": fully, and give it that weight which it deserves, and not give it more, enormous and scaedalous as it is, and deserving every punishment which the law can inflict. The witness says, he thinks he received it in October o November; if so, probably what he received was not dated the 1st of April, as this paper is, hut was dated the 30th of January; thst date agrees with the subject you see, and 5 not unlikely to have been the real date of this paper; whether he is correct im saying he received it in the month of October or Ne vember will depend upon his recollectioa. 
EYRE 12277 He says, that from Chalk-farm they west 
EYRE 12278 -to Conspton-street, where his division used to meet; they supped, and staid there till eleven o'clock; Thelwall was there
EYRE 12280 He was asked as to Gosling and Hillier— he says, he knows them; they came to his father’s house on the Monday, he mentioned 
EYRE 12281 ‘before there having been a meeting appointed in Green Arbour-court, to lay down money for the pikes ;the meeting was postponed to the following Friday. While Costing and Hillier were with him they heard that Hardy was apprehended (that accounts for their not having the pikes); he did understand they meant to have attended the meeting on the Friday—that fir was recommended for shafts to these pikes—he had a pike made himself: 
EYRE 12282 be destroyed the blade upon the Wednesday after he heard Hardy was in custody, being afraid it should be found. He was asked if he had a magic lanthorn? he said he had one—that it had nothing but the destruction -of the Bastile and the beheading the governor 
EYRE 12283 ‘ painted on it
EYRE 12285 Upon his cross-examination he says, he became a member of the Corresponding Sopeg July was twelve month; that he 
EYRE 12286 5 lea pike for himself in March, 1794—he says he heard Yorke at Robins's Coffee-house say, that they had pikes at Sheffield; and he says, he understood that severat members had furnished themselves with arms—he says, it i was just about the time the Hessian troops had been landed without the consent of parliament; but he says, he had no intention to 
EYRE 12287 ‘ use these arms against the government of the country—he meant to get pikes for some who might want them for the same purpose as, he says, he did, to defend himself in case there should be any illegal dispersions of the meet-ings, not against any legal power, but only against illegal attacks upon them; that a great deal of opposition had been shown to their meetings when they proposed to assoClate. 
EYRE 12288 He says, Hardy was always very quiet in the division; he never used any improper expressions; that Hardy made no propositions for arms or pikes; that he told Hardy, he had made a pike. He says that Baxter gave that bill, La Guillotine, to two or three persons; and he, wishing for one, got that which he produced ; he says, he does not know that Har. fascial that; he does not think he would have approved of it; the first bill was of another edition. He understood Hardy knew who the persuns were to whom he was to send for pikes; he says that the pikes were made at the time the Hessian troops were landed. He had notice that there were some spirited Resolutions by the Sheffield Society; he learnt it from a bouk he purch at Eaton’s shop
EYRE 12290 Now, the material fact upon this young man’s evidence with regard to the prisoner, is, that it adduces pretty strong provt that the letter had been received by Hardy from Davison, and that he had, in some sort, acted upon it; whether he had proposed it publicly at the division, or no, yet that he had such a letter, and could tell them where those pikes were to be got; in consequence of that, he madean application to Hardy; and in consequence of that applicatiun, there was to have been a meeting at the Parrot in Green Arbour court, where as many as chose to have pikes were to pay the money; which certainly connects Hardy with these pikes, so far as that transaction goes. 
EYRE 12291 The neat witness is Samuel Williams; he says, he is a gun engraver; that he was a member of the Londun Corresponding Society; he knew Franklow; he saw hinyin his own house ; he was also a member of the Corresponding Society; that Franklow had applied to him to make some arms tor him; he saw the feast advertised, and went to Hardy fora ticket ; Hardy said, it was not usual to give tickets to those who were not me nbers ; he ave him one of the addresses, and said, it was for a reform in parliament. The witness says, he gave Hardy an order forsome shoes, which Hardy made; and then he told Hardy, he was in a line for selling guns; Hardy desired him the next time he came, to bring a gun with him; he broaght him one; Hardy sold it, he then gave Hardy «n order for a pair of boots; Hardy bid him bring two or three guns, which he sold likewise; and one gun was in the house, which was not sold, when the prisoner was apprehended. 
EYRE 12292 He says, he Draws Spence, of Little Turnstile; he had seen Franklow there; he went to Spence’s to instruct persons in the manuat exercise, at the request of Mr. Frankluw; that they exercised in a one or two pair of stairs room, between eight and ten in the evening; and he thinks that the curtains of the room were down; they used to mcet on Thursday night. He says, he became a member by Mr. Hardy’s recommendation, ahout a fortnight or three weeks after his first seeing him, He says, he knew a society called the Loyal Lambeth Association ; that was the association to which these people belonged ; 
EYRE 12293 he says, he went to exercise. them at Frank-of the fact; they were members of the Lonlow’s house, No, 1, China Walk, Lambeth :don Corresponding Society, and therefore, a that Hardy gave him Franklow’s card, andfar as the matter went, were providing them told him, Franklow was ging to raise an as-selves with arms, and, as far as the circunsociation, and would want guns. He says,| stances went, using themselves to the prarthere were articles of this Lambeth Associa-tice of arms ; how far the prisoner is, under tion printed; they imported that it was anthese circumstances, to he unplicated im thas, associalion of the inhabitants of Lambeth;you will judge. 
EYRE 12294 but he says, that this association was not The next witness is Frederick Polydor composed, in fact, of Lambeth inhabitants; }-Nodder; he says, he was a member of the he knew that only Franklow was an inhabi-.London Corresponding Society; he says, be tant of Lambeth. Franklow disciplined some saw Williams at Spence’s, when men were at his house himself. The witness says, heexercising ; that same of them were members supplied eleven stand of arms. Franklow-of the Corresponding Society, He only goes paid for all the muskets but one; there wereto confirm Williams, as to his having see to have been sixty stand of arms. Williams at Spence’s, exercising men. 
EYRE 12295 The printed Articles were produced, which Williams was called again. He says, thet describe how they were to be armed; and it| he remembers a avangs conversatioa m states, that the inhabitants of Lambeth wereHardy’s shop, about how long would be bein getting a thousand guns ; be said, that it was a thing far beyond his capacity, to meapeg such an order; and therefore there was no more conversation about it: I de not thmk much is to be made of that; the man wass stranger ; Hardy did not appear to join in the conversation; it seems to end im nothing; and I do not think you can connect it so asmake any thing out of it; therefore I do ont mean to state it as a circumstance upon whxb you can raise any thing. 
EYRE 12296 The next witness is George Sanderson, who says that he was at Shelmerdine’s, in the Borough, upon the second of April; he says, be went there to decide a bet; that he saw there, about seven or eight stand of arms, and some men exercising, who belonged to an armed society; that they were members of the Londua Corresponding Society ; that their numbers were about twenly-six or twenty-seven; be says he might have seen about twenty-icur or twenty-five together at Shelmerdine’s; he says they objected to him because he was not amember of the London Corresponding Se ciety, but they admitted him upon his promising to become a member ; he understood that they were to obtain a reform of parizment at the point of the bayonet ; be does not mention who said that, nor what the particular expressions of the conyersation were from which he collects that, but that he collected it from their general conversation. 
EYRE 12297 He says that they adjourned to the house of one Day, in Worcester-street, where there was a private committee, who had settled certain places where they were to assemble, he says that one of the meetings was at Spence’s, another at a shed in Westminster, near Tothill Fields Bridewell; he attended Pretty constantly; sometimes at ‘s sometimes in Westminster, from the eleventh of April to about the first of May ; they were taught the manual exercise by one Ost, whe had. served la pe Franch my a sq a member. of the Correspo! fe say8 that Shelmerdine was a hatter, that he frequently changed his men; and be end one reqson for removing from Shelmerdine’s, alarmed with apprehensions of an invasion and civil commotion; that therefore they Meant to associate ; that part of them met at the Borough; that a condition of the association was. not to go beyond the parish of Lambeth ; that they proposed to divide into ten divisions. He says their conversatiqn was about a parliamentary reform ; but, from conVersation with Franklaw, he understood, that, if they did not get a reform in parliament, they would have it ly force of arms; that none but members of the London Corresponding Society attended this Lambeth Association. 
EYRE 12298 You sce, this man speaks of guns, which he supplied to Hardy and to Franklow, for this Lambeth Association ; with regard to what he supplied to Hardy, I think you can hardly raise much implication from that upon Hardy; it isa mutual concern in trade; this man begun it by buying shvues of Hardy ; and he intimated to Hardy that he was in the gun line; in consequence of which, Hardy gave him an order, and he gave Hardy another order; and then Hardy gave him another order, and he disposed of muskets for him, which he might do, for all that I see from that part of the case, very innocently ; Lut it has somewhat of a different complexion with respect to Franklow’s Association ; for, if any thing is to be objected to that association, there Is something to object to Hardy, for having given this man a card to Franklow, gad mentioning his association. 
EYRE 12299 Now, that this association was to be objected to, is evident from the circumstances of the case; for, you see, this is an association carried on in a private and clandestine manner; they meet in small parties, exercising in a room, ata late hour, the curtains down, and circumstances of concealment, and a concealment, very contrary to what might be expected in the ordinary case of an association, where people are proud of their arms, and of appearing in their uniform ; so that nothing seems to account for their proceeding in that clandestine manner; therefure the Lambeth Association seems an assumed name, and not warranted by the real circumstances was, that they thought some of his men might not be staunch to the cause; that was his expression. 3 
EYRE 12300 He says he was one night at a meeting of the division in Shire-lane, a member mentioned a circumstance which was: mot proeeeded upon, and therefore does not seem to amount to much; that Mr. Pitt was to go over one of the bridges at twelve ofclock at night; somebody pe) it was very improper to make any comment upon that, and nothing more passed upon it; he says there had been news of a defeat of the British army, which they of this society treated as good news; he says that one of them said he had the pleasure to inform the society that one of the king’s messengers had been killed in the country ; another said if it had been his own son should have been glad; he savs there were frequent intimations to take care of spies; that there was a proposition that ten should meet at one house—that is; nine of them to meet at the house of the tenth; they talked of blowing a spy’s brains out. The witness was asked what he was, if he was not a spy— he says he was; that they were talking of a reform of parliament at the point of the Dayonet ; that that appeared to be the intention of this armed society from the general conversation. 
EYRE 12301 Now the circumstance mentioned by this witness of the manner in which these people were shifting about under the direction of a Secret Committee, to be exercised in small numbers at different places, with the observation that was made in regard to Shelmerdine’s frequently changing his men, with the apprehension that his men might not be staunch to the cause, certainly warrants very great suspicion that this armed society was forming for no good purposes, and that this is, therefore, a circumstance which does make part of atie case which is now under consideration; pr it is,Ithink, if this evidence be true, impossible to suppose that this was a regular volunteer society, who were only arming themselves for these ostensible purposes exalti in these articles; they state strange language to have been used by these people, you will judge what credit is due to that evidence ; if they did use such language, it shows that their minds, at least, must have been in 2 state of very creat irritation, and that they had designs not fit for honest men to entertain, and which must create real apprehensions in the minds of all those who know that such designs were conceived by such men. 
EYRE 12302 Edward Gosling, who was also a member of the Correspwnding Society, says that upon the fifteenth of Anril, 1794, he was admitted a member; that Mr. Wickham, a magistrate, had desired him to he proposed; that he went to Hillier to inquire after a man he happened to know that was a member of that society ; he says what led him to go to Hillier was, that having seen seditious pamphlets there, he thought he might be able to leartt frorh him where this man was; he says that he concluded ftom the circumstance of these pamphlets being sold there that he was a member of the Corresponding Society. —that led him to inquite of Hiller after thts tan; he sdys, he was proposed without any communication with the magistrate; but he attended afterwards in order to discover whether they really had atty intention to arm. 
EYRE 12303 He says that the division he belonged to was number eleven, meeting in Northamptonstreet, Clerkenwell, he did not recollect: the sigh, but the man that kept the house was named Holt; he says that there was some conversation about the meeting at Chalk Farm, which had been on the day before that it was said to be necessary to arm for the purpose of defending the Convention as they had done in France. 
EYRE 12304 If this was a fact well established, it would be a very strong faet indeed in the case, because wheri you once stippose the idea to be that the Convention was to meet without arms, to act peaceably and in order, and that the others were to defend them with arms, that would give that Convention a complexion to be sure of a very dangerous nature indeed, and would go a great way to warrant every thing that has been said of it. But you wilt remember that this very strong fact 1s stated by a man of Gosling’s description, to whom some exceptions in point of credit lay, the weight of which you will weigh in your minds. 
EYRE 12305 He says that the Convention was to be called in about six weeks; that they talked of repelling force by force, if Mr. Dundas should bring his Scotch laws into England; that the expression used was, “ The infamous and ever to be detested Court of Justiciary in Scotland; he says that there were one or two hundred thousand copies of the proceeds ings and resolutions of that day ordered to be printed. 
EYRE 12306 On the Monday after this, he says he was at another division mecting at one Mortis’s, a jack-maker’s, in Brick-lane; that division, he believes, was called number sixteen and twenty-five; doctor Hodgson was recommended by the committee to be relieved; he says that he and Hillier went to see this doctor Hodgson, who, I take it, was at that time in Newgate; they found Lloyd, Roussel, and a captain Williams, an Amcrican, with Hodgson; there was a conversation with doctor Hodgson, he asked the witness if he had seen a copy of the new constitution, by which this Corresponding Suciety was to be divided into small divisions to learn the use of arms at one another’s houses; that it was almost ready—that they were to be called tythings —that their object was, to keep spies from getting into the society ; their numbers’ were tncreasing, and they would soon be irresistible. The witness observed that there were ne men of property among them, to which Roussel made this reply, that as soon as they were organized, money should not be wanting. That will also be a very strong circumstance in the case, if you should be of opinion that this witness is deserving of credit. He says that Lloyd gave a toast— “ The world a republic or a desart. Doctor Hodgson said he hoped soon to see a Revolutionary Tribunal established in this country, for he hated all others; Roussel said he was going fram thence to Thelwall’s, and he should set off next day. Hillier asked if he was going to France, he said, yes. 
EYRE 12307 The witness says he was that evening at the division he belonged to, the eleventh division, that one Wright, a delegate, was there; that when he was coming away, Wright asked him if he had got any arms? he said no; Wright told him it would be necessary that all should have arms, as possibly we might very soon be compelled to use them ; he says Gordon was their secretary, that Gordon said he was going to America, that he was very sorry to Teave the society just as they were going to act as well as tu think, and to regeDerate their country; that he should take some copies of their spirited resolutions to be delivered to the popular societies in America, Hillier mentioned his not having got a musket, but he said he had got a pike. 
EYRE 12308 He says on the twenty fifth of April he was at Hillier's house, number eighty or eighty-one, in Bishopsgate street; that there was a person there whose name he was told was Wicksly, and there was a drunken man there, and a man of the name of Bennet; Wicksly said he had received a letter from Shetheld, stating that there had been a numerous meeting there, and that they had determined to petition no more fura parliamentary reform ; that there were some knives making of a particular construction at Sheffield; that the letier contained a drawing of the knives, that they were to be fixed to poles, and they talked of their use being to cut the reins of the horses; that the principal dependance of the society consisted in securing the royal family and both houses of parliament. Hillier said if they could resist the first shock from the army, there would be no danger afterwards: the king being secured, the army would have no head to look up to, and would be gine to accept the additional vay that would be offered them; that men would not fight for six pence a day if they could have a larger sum; he says that nobudy objected to all this. He says when he was going away, Bennet went out with him into the street; that his conversation was so violent, and he spoke su luud, that he the witness checked him, for that persons walking by would take Dotice of what he said. 
EYRE 12309 He says he knows Baxter, that on the ninth af May he had a material conversation with Baxter at Hillier’s house; he says Baxter stated that he had been with Mr. Joyce, who was secretary to earl Stanhope; that Baxter, 
EYRE 12310 ; why do not you blow them all up 
EYRE 12311 Bennet, and Hillier were at Hillier’s, and some other persons at a part of this conversation; Baxter said there was no danger to be apprehended for Stone, that is the apprehended for high treason, for he too much firmness to let them get any thas out of him: he said that the mittee of Correspondence and Co-operation were preparing an address to the army, with some fe solutions, and he said that prudent and dete. mined men were wanted to 2 the opinions contained in those resolutions; be said that one Moore had been active and successful in getting over the army; that they had most to fear from the young recruits, they had succeeded best with the old soldiers; that if one-third of the army were got over, the others would not do mach. Then the fact was mentioned of Baxter's hav. ing an interview with some officers; that Baxter said one of the officers said to him, together. He says, that Baxter asked him if he knew who would buy a pike, the witness said, he should have no objection to purchase cee, but it would be of no service unless he knew how to use it; he says. Baxter said, if be would go the Thursday or Friday following, to the Parrot in Green Arbour Court, in tbe Old Bailey, and ask for one Edwards, be 
EYRE 12312 ; would be called out to him, that he was to tell Edwards that Baxter had sent him, thea he was to have a pike, and that he would be introduced to others with whom he might learn the use of them, that Edwards was a very clever fellow, and could teach him, that pikes were much cheaper than muskets, that muskets could not be supplied on account ef their expense —and that people might do mischief if they did not know how to use 
EYRE 12313 ‘ them. 
EYRE 12314 ‘The witness says, he observed they might have a parliamentary reform without coming to blows, upon which Baxter said; “ Is there a man in the society, that believes a parliamentary reform is all we want? No, not one —he said that many men of property bad hitherto kept back on account of the sanguinary conduct of the French, but that they were now willing to come forward, as they were convinced a revolution might be effected ina few hours—that he, Baxter, did not wish the king or any of his family to lose their own lives, he thought they might go to Hanover, but that it must be expected that some blood must be shed, for some poreuler persons bad offered such insults to the people that human nature could not overlook. 
EYRE 12315 He says the conversation afterwards turned upon Thelwall’s having been indicted, in which there was nothing very material —He said he attended most to Baxter’s conversation, because he was informed he was one of the Committee of Correspondence and Cooperation. Baxter said many thousand pikes were making at Sheffield, that the heads were only to come from thence, and that they were - to be stecked in town; -he recommended that ? pothing of that should be mentioned at any. of the divisions, till the new constitution should be adopted, for there were spies in the society; that it would be adviseable to let the French prisoners out, if the emigrants resisted, that the emigrants should share the fate of the Swiss at Paris. He mentioned the names of Mr. Pitt, Mr. Dundas, Mr. Reeves, and other persons who had offered such insults nto the poorle that human nature could not everluok. He says, in going home with Baxter, he oe tood from. conversation he had with him, that the address to the army, was to set the troops and the emigrants, to be embodied, -. at variance, and they were to say to the army, that they had sworn to fight for the king and ; country, and if they were at variance, the might choose which side they pleased; that it would be proper to enlarge upon the severity of their usage, and the smallness of their pay, ba they must first sound their principles, and if they found the soldiers were Aristocrats, thea they must not go on. He saysthat with Tespect to all these circumstances, he comMunicated them from time to time to Mr. Wickham, that be gave him intelligence of woat ro On his cross-examination, he is asked what “ situation he was in, he said he kept a broker’s shop—he is asked if he did not deal in king’s ; Stores, he said he did say to a man to whom he was unwilling to give his name, that he dealt in naval stores, thinking that would put the man off from any farther inquiry—he says that he is employed by a magistrate, in Worship-street, which occasioned him to say that—he denies that he lived by smuggling, and cheating the king io his stores. "He was asked if he ever went by the name Of Douglas; he says he did for six years, while he carried on the business of a hair’ dresser, which is ten years since, in Petty France, at No. 3. He says his fatherhada shop of business in the city, that hewisbed to go out for improvement, and did notlike to appear as a journeyman, when his’ father kept four or five men in his own house ; that his taking the name of Douglas, was a mere accidental circumstance. 
EYRE 12316 He was asked if he knowsa Mr. Lincoln, whocollects rents for Mr. Macnamara; he sayshe does, and that he borrowed from Mr. Lincola, four or five years ago, ten pound, or ten guineas, and gave him a note for it, in the name of Douglas, while he bore that name, which has been since paid. He says Mr. Macnamara caine to him to the coffeehouse, where he and the other witnesses were; that he behaved so ill to him, that he was much flurried, and did not know what he said; that Mr. Macnainara came to the coffeehouse to him, and said that the note would appear against him if it was not paid. 
EYRE 12317 He was asked whether he not by inflammatory expressions, excited these people to say the things which he had stated—he says that he may have appeared to have approved of what was doing, but he never did approve of it — particularly that he never said, “ why don’t the society learn the use of arms. 
EYRE 12318 He is then asked as to a Mrs. Coleman, who had lived with him, and died in his house; he says he made her will, and that no partofher property was left to her relations —he is asked if a brother of a former husband had not made some charge agaiust him—he says he never heard any complaint, or an charge against his conduct respecting the will, but that a brother had come up to make a claim. He is asked if he knows one Cox, cheesemonger—he says hehas dealt with him, and he did not use him very well, but nothing turns upon that, for he is not called. Then there was a print produced, which was found upon Roussel, it is an engraving of the manual exercise of soldiers, with caps upon their heads, intended to be painted red —you understand that it is the cap of libert now worn in France, and is a sort of signal, by which men who entertain these opinions may be known. 
EYRE 12319 Gentlemen, I stated to you before, that this witness has given very important evidence, tending to show the determined purpose of this Convention to use force against the king, his family, and the government—If this man’s evidence can be depended upon, he certainly states Baxter to use very strong language, so indiscreet, that one could hardly have thought that a man would have ventured to use—and on the other band, the observation made upon this, is certainly founded, that this man is not contradicted with regard to the testimony that he gives, and that all they rely upon to shake his credit, is what turns out upon his cross-examination—the account he gives of himself, of bis having told a man that he dealt in naval stores, for a vile purose—having borne the name of Douglas— fering acted about in that sort of way, and going there for the purpose of firing information to government. gentlemen, it is your province to judge what degree of credit you think fit to give to this man’s evidence. 
EYRE 12320 The next witness, is Joha Groves—he is another man, whose credit is more directly impeached than Gosling’s has been, who also speaks materially, it his evidence is true. He says he was at the Globe tavern, on the twentieth of January, 1794; he became a member early in the month of February, he was desired to become a member, in order to make a discovery; he says there was a very large assembly, he believes Mr. Martin was called to the chair, who read an address, and Mr. Richter read it over again; he does not recollect any particular toast which was drank, but a great many were read; and by a paper that was printed, he should be able to refresh his memory—he says in general, the conversation was universal suffrage, and annual parliamentsthat their object was to enlighten men’s minds, to embrace opportunities of instruction, to learn the natural freedom of ali mankind, that-he heard nothing about arms. 
EYRE 12321 He says, he was present at Thelwall’s lecture ; that it was a general abuse of the administration, and the branches of the legisla: ture : he spoke of the king in terms of contempt; he used the word Solomon, ironically;. he said, that the House of Lords was an eristocratic branch, which swallowed up almost all other functions of the government; that he recommended a convention, in order to procure annual parliaments and universal suffrage; and that he recommended a new modelling of the House of Commons. 
EYRE 12322 He says, he was at Chalk-farm; Hardy was there; that Lovett was in the chair; that there were printed papers dispersed; there was a letter trom the Corresponding Society to the Friends of the People, earnestly soliciting the concurrence and assistance of that society, in assembling a convention of the friends of freedom, for the purpose of obtaining, ina legal and constitutional method, a full and effectual representation ; he says, the answer was read from the Friends of the People to the Corresponding Society, dated April the eleventh, 1794, and then their letter; a number of resolutions were put, and two hundred thousand copies ordered to be published. 
EYRE 12323 Groves says, he went to a house in Storestreet, Tottenham Court Road, where the meeting was to be held; he went part of the way with Thelwall; he says there was a written paper upon the dour of the house, in Store-strect, stating that the mecting was to be held at Chalk-farm; he says, Lovett was in the chair; the principal persons who spoke and acted at that mecting, were Lovett, Richter, Thelwall, and Hodgson; that Thelwall made two or three speeches; he says, there was aclamour went round that there were spies and informers there; Mr. Thelwall said, he was for admitting all spies and informers there, because the number of the members of the London Corresponding Society could be no agreeable news to the minister ; he says Richter read the resolutions ; that Richter stopt reading to make some observation of his own; upon which Hardy said “ read, sir, without comment ; this was when Richter was reading the address. 
EYRE 12324 The witness says, he returned to the division room, in Compton-street ; that ‘Thelwall was in the chair; that Thelwall, taking a pot of porter in his hand, he blew off the head of the porter, and said, this is the way I would have all kings served, or this is the way I would serve all kings. Being asked, if an particular toast was given, he says that Thelwall gave—The lantern, or Jamp-iron at the end of Parliament-street; he called for some one to cover it; to give another toast I suppose ; and somebody cried out,—The ‘treasury-bench; he thinks there was mo visitor there, at this time; ‘he says, that Green was a member, and that he liad a private conversation with hia in the coffee-room ; that be talked of annual parliaments and universal suffrage ; but he said, these were only to be considered as ladders to obtain their ends. 
EYRE 12325 He says, there was a kind of shed at Chalkfarm, in which they were eating bread and cheese, and drinking porter; that several people there pulled out a cutting instrumest, corresponding with each other; a sort of French knife, which when the elasp was opened, iLprevene its joint working, so that it was fixed straight forward ; that Pearce had one; somebody said, they were bread end cheese knives; upon that observation there was a smile; he says, he looked upon them as harmless instruments, certainly ; be asked, where they were to be had; they said he might have some of Green; he asked, where Green was to be found; they ‘said, he wass perfumer and hair-dresser, in Orange-strec, Leicester- fields. 
EYRE 12326 He says he went to Greent’s for one of these knives; Green said, he had sold between twe and three hundred; that Green teld him te speak very low; the parlour door was oper, which was adjoining the shep, and he smied, and said, for my wite is a damned aristocrat: that he attended the meetings regularly; tht Pearce, wheh they were at Chalk-farm, sad, if you strike with them, speaking of these knives, they wil not fly back, or words to that purpose; he says a man, from Sheffic’d, found fault with the construction of these knives ; he said they might be made better; that they were not equal to those at Sheikeld. 
EYRE 12327 He says, he was at a mecting, when a subscription was proposed for Dr. Hodeson, which application was rejected, on the ground of the violence of his conduct; and there was another reason, if the witness's memory wz right, that he was not considered as a member; he said he was present at the Crown and Anchor tavern, upon the second ef May; that there was a division meetinz in February, when an address from Stockpert, was read ; that was division namber two an4 number three, in Compton-street ; this beisz so late as the fifth of January, 1794, it will be proper to read that paper. 
EYRE 12328 Gentlemen, the whole of the paper, in point of general inflammation, is very bad: but & is the last passage which is materiully connected with the present case, and the date ss material, the fifth of January 1794. 
EYRE 12329 Jobin Groves went on to say, that the prisener came to his house, in Crown-court, Co vent-garden, and brought him a ticket for the dinner, on the second of May, at the Crcwn and Anchor; he said he paid nothing for it:was the annual dinner of the Constitetivnal Society, and there was a eertain number of the Corresponding ‘Society invited, about twenty in all he said there was some news came, while they were there, of some public event; he understood it was very bad news ; that it seemed to give universal satisfaction ; that there was a song, called “‘lhe Free Constitution, delivered out before dinner, and there was a paper on each plate, but he does not recollect what it was; he belicves Mr. Wharton was in the chair; that Mr. Horne ‘Tooke was. there, and the prisoner Hardy, was there; that when the company came into the room, the French popular tunes were struck up, and encored, and thev played ulmost the whole of the dinner, the Marsellois march, Ca ira, and the Carmagnol, and that it was a continual scene of clapping. 
EYRE 12330 He says, that after dinner Mr. Horne Tooke addressed himself to the company; he prefaced his address by an observation, that he supposed one out of fifty, in the room, might be considered as a government spy, and to them in particular he wished to address himself; and the witness says, in consequence of his addressing himself to government spies, he did attend to what he said; he begged the company to take netice, that he was not inebriated, for, having something to say to the company, he teek oare to refrain trom his pass and for fear of being mistaken, and eing taken to be in a state of intoxication, he begged every body present to take particuJar notice of what he said ; he called the parliament a scoundrel sink of corruption; and the opposition he called a scoundrel sink of opposition ; that a juaction betwen these two scoundrel parties was formed, for the purpose of destroying the rights and liberties of the country. He spoke about the House of Lords, the hereditary nobilzy ; he asked if that skipjack, naming a particular lord, could be considered as one of the hereditary nobility; he said the same of the House of Lords as of the House of Commons, he said the junto between the two parties was in order to amuse or abuse that poor man, the king; he said, that the junction of partics in the House of Commons, was in order to abuse and deceive the people of this country, He says, Mr. Tooke's speech was received with great applause ; that there was a song sung, to the tune of “ God save the king, but not those words: he says, that Mr. Horne Tooke sung an additional verse of the song; he had furgot what that was. 
EYRE 12331 Upon his cross-examination, he says he follows the business of a conveyancer, and has done so two and twenty years; he is not an attorney; he was asked, whether he was a solicitor; he said be did not understand what was meant by the question; at last he admitted, that he was a solicitor, in this Place; a solicitor for prosecutions and prisoners; he said, when Thelwall and he conversed, that Thelwall rather fixed himsclf upon him, than he upon Thelwall; he said there were a number of very respectable gentlemen, at the Crown and Anchor; that Mr. Tooke spoke highly of the hereditary nobility of the country; -he said, they .had lest their weight in the state, by the introduction of the new nobility, who had been introduced into the House of Lords, by means of their conduct ia the House of Commons; he said he spoke highly of the office of the king, in the constitution ; he said, that the new made peers, or those lately introduced into the House of Lords, either had combined, or were combining, for the purpose of amusing that poor man, the king; that the king had lost his true weight in the constitution, by means of this corruption; he says the object ofall his conversation was, that improper people were brought into the House of Commons, and that thereby the evil complained of arose. They then read a song, which was found at Hardy’s house, in a letter addressed to Hardy, without date ; that song must be read. 
EYRE 12332 Gentlemen, I would observe to you, upon this song, what perhaps may occur upon some other parts of the evidence. It was fairly observed, on the part of the prisoner, that there is a great deal of difference between this sort of loose paper, found at his house, in the situation he was in, as secretary to this popu society, to whom, therefore, all sorts of things would of course be addressed, which, perhaps, it would be prudent to destroy ; but every mam is not, in that respect, quite prudent; that there isa vast difference between this sort of thing, and a paper which bad been commus nicated, and acted upon, and made thereby the act of the party himself, by his own con duct upon it; the evidence could not be rejected, because the keeping such papers is some reproach to a prudent man, and affords some evidence of the improper connexions he forms, in consequence ot which all these sort of licentious things come to him. 
EYRE 12333 The next witness is John Thompson, whe proved the finding a pike at Hillier’s. 
EYRE 12334 William Camage is then examined again; he says, that he saw Margarotin the Tolbooth, at Edinburgh; that he had a spring knife upon his table; that it was hard to shut, and hy his description, something like these Sheffield knives; he says he never saw one at Sheftield; that this knife lay publicly for him to get his dinner with; there were six or seven peuple present; and it was showed te him as a curious knife. 
EYRE 12335 George Lynam says he became a member of the Corresponding Society, in October, 1792, of the division number twelve, at the sign of the Mansion House, opposite to the Mansion House; he says he received the rules of the society, and the address of the suciety, in March, 1792; having received these papers he intimated to the master of the house, that he thought it would be dangerous for him to permit the division to come to his house; that he, therefore, declined to let them come to his house; he says the division adjourned to the Crown in Newgate 
EYRE 12336 ‘street, and he was accepted. as a member of this society, upon the twenty-ninth of Octoder; he says he was at the Unicorn, Coventrden, at the division number two; that I take to be Hardy’s division; that there was a large meeting; the room was full; there might he seventy or eighty people there; Hardy appeared as secretary ; he says Paine’s Address tu the French nation, was voted to be published, and delivered out to all the divisions; that a paper called the Rights and duties of Man, was to be continued weekly ; that the delegates had received addresses, approving of the society’s address to the National Convention ; that the delegate of the division reports to the division what is done at the committee of delegates. Tt will be proper here just to observe how tbat stands
EYRE 12338 Barrere or Barlow; he seems to give buts blundering account of that, it certainly w quite another sort of thing)
EYRE 12340 Gentlemen, you recollect, that letter was read, and that when they did answer it, the answer was more guarded than some of the letters of the society ; it was. such an answer as might naturally lead one to think that there was some suspicion ; it is a curious aicumstance, that in the notes of this man, who attended the divisions regularly, and took notes as being a delegate, it should be noted that they suspected that letter from Norwich did not come from a friend, and that it was meant to draw them into some scrape. 
EYRE 12341 He then speaks of the branching of of s new division, number twenty-three, from number twelve; and this new division met at the Ship, in Moorfields, on the tweaty-seventh of November—he says, he was chosen a delegate of this new division he was recommended by his division; and it was pees at that time that the public should be it ed that they were not levellers, and that they wished to avoid all riots and all resistence: that this arose from the magistrates having interfered with their meeting—that the conversation was, that the first cnaracters at Edinburgh belonged to the cause, had themselves into a society, and called them selves a Convention of delegates. 
EYRE 12342 Upon the twenty-ninth of November, be says, he attended a meeting of delegates 2 the Sun, in Windmill-street; there were twenty-two delegates present
EYRE 12344 that division eleven had received twenty wis'
EYRE 12345 tors from Islington; that a society was intended to be formed there. The sub-committee brought forward their answer to the Crown and Anchor Society, which was referred back, and another answer was offered, drawn by a fe of the name of Vaughan, “couusellor Vaughan, who was a visitor then from the Constitutional Society, and this was approved with some alterations; the words “ dying in the cause were struck out; it was directed to be put in the Sunday’s paper; and that five hundred bills should be pasted up, ‘that they were not levellers—and if their funds were low, Mr. Vaughan said, the Constitutional Society would print for them
EYRE 12347 He was then shown a note, which he says, he received from Hardy; itis in these words —(addressed, Mr. Lynam, No. 31, Walbrooke; dated December the 4th, 1792)— “Citizen Lynam; you are requested to meet the Special Committee this evening, at seven o'clock, at the Nag’s Head, Orange Street, Leicester Fields. Iam, your fellow citizen, homas Harpy. 
EYRE 12348 “Please to inform any of the delegates near you, that you know, but no one else. 
EYRE 12349 This is a circumstance, in some degree, confirmatory of Lynam’s general evideace
EYRE 12351 Upon the thirteenth of December the delelegates inet in Round-court, in the Strand; cighteen persons were present; Hardy was one
EYRE 12353 Lynam says, his note goes on to state— That division, number one, recommends that it be represented to the public, that confusion may he expected, but that if riots ensue, our societies will aid the magistrates, and that copies shall be sent to the magistrates; but take care that we say, that no disposition appears of committing any riot, and that we will persevere in a parliamentary reform but if prosecuted persons were not found to be rash in words or violence, that it is proper for the society to protect them—he says, I do not know whether any thing was done upon that; there were many things agitated in the committee
EYRE 12355 He says, that division, number thirty-three, mct at Crown Street, upon the eightcenth of December; nothing passed there. Upon the twentieth of December, the delegates met at number thirty-one, Compton Street; Hardy was present; two members were deputed from the Constitutional Whigs to know if the Corresponding Socicty would concur in an Address to the Friends of the People. Division, number twelve, recommended to petition a liament before Mr. Grey brings in his bill for parliamentary reform—Martin recommended not to publish any thing ; that the times would not do; that they cculd not stand against the treasury. Number sixteen moves for the delegates to determine if they should sign the Address at the Crown and Anchor: and this was left to every man’s discretion; that is the address that had been formed there, by another party, in support of government; the question was, whether they should sign that Address; and this was left to every man’s discretion, but to avoid it, if possible. Margarot wrote to Cozens, that we will not sign at any of the meetings. 
EYRE 12356 There is a communication from Norwich, that five guineas had been sent up, in order to have Mr. Fox's speech on a parliamentary reform, sent down to the persons from whom the money came; and they were to publish some hand-bills, to express a determination to persevere. Five hundred copies of Mr. Fox’s speech were sent accordingly. Division number sixteen proposed to give tickets to soldiers, to admit them gratis, if they chose to enter ; but that they shall be warned of their danger: this was not agreed to. Division number twenty-four moved to publish our determination to support the magistrates, and persevere ina parliamentary reform: this was agreed to; and Margarot was desired to draw it up. A petition trom Carter, who was employed to stick bills up; that he lost a place of twelve shillings a week. Martin had been directed to defend him ; and there was a subscription to detray the expense. Ridgway had communicated, that he was ready to publish any thing the society chose to send him. It was observed by Margarot, respecting Mr. Fox, that he had gone as far as could be expected ; but that they were not obliged to him; for he was forced to avow what he had done. Martin reported that Gay had employed Carter to stick up bills; and that he had stuck them up in the morning, instead of the evening, as he was directed; in consequence of which, he was taken up. The next is number thirtyone, Compton-street, a meeting of the delegaics on the twenty-seventh of December. The prisoner was there. Each delegate was to take the sense of his division, on the propriecty of admitting soldiers, aud on what terms. ’ 
EYRE 12357 IIe says, upon the third of January, 1793, there was a meeting of delegates, at number thirty-one, Compton-street; Margarot was chosen president; Hardy, secretary ; Field, sub-secretary. ‘Lhe distresses of one Thompson’s wife were laid before the meeting; he was a member, but had gone away to France ; twelveshillings and sixpence was collected for her. There was a motioncame forward, for a declaration to the public; two divisions objected to it; the declaration was proposed to be published ; the objection was, because the declaration said, rather have a constitution without a king, than a king without a constitution: it was observed, that this would be a thing proper to be said, if they were republicans. Margarot reported that he had received a letter. Notice was given of five delegates from the Roman Catholics in Ireland, who were of the same mind with themselves; and the application was to them, to see whethera communication could be opened with them Hardy was present. 
EYRE 12358 The next is a meeting at the division number twenty-three, January the eighth, m Crown-street, Moorfields. He says, I have got down here, that the declaration—I sy pose the declaration mentioned before—it s the opinion of this division, that it should be rejected ; it was agreed likewise, not to address the king at all. It was said, Mr. Grey would not bring forward his motion fora reform, unless petitions were sent to parliament; agreed to petition parliament by all means, and not to address them. 
EYRE 12359 ‘The nextis a meeting on the tenth of January, 1793, at number thirty-one, Old-Compton-street ; seventeen delegates attended, of whom Hardy was one; the declaration was ordered to lie upon the table ; then it was agreed upon, that no written paper be brought in, but by a delegate, or throug the treasurer or secretary. Margarotreported, that the cous try correspondence did not shine ; there were very few letters; he reported that he had sent a letter to the Friends of the People, at Free Masons’ tavern: the answer was read; that they expected to obtain an effectual re form ; they were desired not to mix fore’ politics with home politics, and to avoid foreign correspondence. It was remarked, that this society, that is, the socicty at Free Masons’ tavern, never brought forward their prin ciples ; and it was determined not to correspond with them. Bell observed, that the address to the National Convention of France, proves that we mean their laws here; to which, according to this minute, Margarot said, no doubt; others said nothing. 
EYRE 12360 That, you see, is the most material of all these papers I have hitherto read to vou; that, in the course of the conversation at this meeting of delegates, respecting their address to the National Convention of France, Bell said, it proved that they meant the French laws should be established here ; to which Margarot said, no doubt; the others said nothing; Hardy was then present. 
EYRE 12361 He says, it was observed, that a plau which had been proposed, of the addition of a hundred members to the House of Commons, will not do; it will give them more advan! and keep us from a proper reform. It was reported that one of the Irish delegates had agreed to correspond. Ata meeting on the 14th of January, at Hardy's, Hardy said, he had dispersed fifty of our addresses, and twelve of Keirsant’s speech. 
EYRE 12362 The nextis a meeting of delegates, on the 17th of January, at number thirty-one, Compton-street. It was reported that nineteen of the divisions were kept up. It was that they were to debate, and consider whether the age of eighteen, or twenty-one, was the proper age for voting for a member of parliament: it was argued, it should be eighteen, because, at that age, they are liable to be militia-men. Division number twelve recommended to consider of a public meeting, to discuss parliamentary reform ; that was referred back again, for further consideration. Number four proposed thanks to the mayor of Glasgow, and to the society of Durham and Dundee, for uniting with the society. There were sixteen delegates present. A petition from Carter was presented, who had reccived sentence for sticking up a bill, supposed to be a libel. A special committee appointed to examine how his defence had been conducted. A motion was made for all the delegates to meet on a Saturday evening, to discuss political subjects. A letter was received from Norwich; the Friends of the People want to propose a mild reformation ; and this society of Norwich want to know whether they are friends. One Hobhouse had formed a society at Bath, and proposed a correspondence. Then it was proposed to correspond with the Norwich Society, through the means of the Bell Society. 
EYRE 12363 He says, on January the 24th, there was a meetingat number thirty-one, in Comptonstreet. Two gentlemen came with a petition from Thompson's wite. Martin thought it should be rejected. There was a conversation about the defence of the bill-sticker, and also an account of what counsel had been applied to, and who did undertake the defence ; there was an anxiety about the manuscript of this bill which had been stuck up, which had got into the hand of Grant. A letter from Richter, that he did not dare attend. The delegate number five is going to France, with some copics of Paine’s works; he had private notice that they would all be taken up. 
EYRE 12364 Upon the 31st of January, Baxter, the deJegate from number sixteen, proposed that, in future, of the quarterage money six-pence should go to the society, and the other sevenpence to go towards the expense of the room ; at was agreed that this might be a very proper measure to be adopted for the poor divisions, but not for the rest. It was remarked, and assented to by all, that, supposing there should be an opposition, and the two parties should come to an open rupture, it would be proper to encourage the two divisions, number sixteen, and number twenty-five, in Spital-fields, because they were very numerous, and it is necessary to keep them together. ‘hese are the divisions before mentioned to be as large as all the other divisions put together. This last remark, he says, he makes from his recollection. Number seven proposed to publish a letter, which had been written by a Mr. Law to Mr. Reeves respecting the business of an association ; but this was rejected; and another publication was proposed. The reply to the answer of the Friends of the People, objects that they were not explicit ; and they want to know how far they mean to go with their design ; and Lynam’s note is, that they were apprehensive of a breach. The general sense of the Friends of the People did not go as faras the London Corresponding Society, or Constitutional Society, who thought that it must come to a struggle : this, he said also was recollection. Margarot said, they were getting on fast again ; a petition is not the mode. Then comes a material passage —but yet, it was agreed a petition should be presented, to keep the public mind ayitated upon the subject of reform. 
EYRE 12365 He says, upon the fitth of February, the division number twenty-three, met in Crownstreet. It was reported, there were sixty friends to the cause, who declined, at present, meeting the society; but they are ood friends, and wish them success; that there were certain religious socicties in the kingdom, whose sentiments led strictly to republicanism ; they were numerous in several of the great towns; naming them; and particularly in London: and that the societies in London were just now beginning to organize themselves agreeably to the principles in France, and that they were to meet on Mondays and Thursdays. It was said that Paine’s works had been published in Sweden. 
EYRE 12366 The next meeting wason the 7th of February, of the delegates, at number eight, Queen-street, Seven Dials. ‘The prisoner, Hardy, wasthere. ‘They were anxious to preserve the divisions, sixteen, and twenty-five, as poor divisions; these were Baxter's divisions; that they would be of great service, if we should go to war; this was an observation of Margarot’s. Many said, it was eventually expected that there would bea rising in the country. A letter, sent to Bath, has been gone fourteen days, and no answer, though two letters have a sent. A Sheftield letter, of the 16th of January, by order of the Constitutional Society, had been conveyed to alk the societies, reljuesting to know how far they mean to go; and all were of one opinion not to petition this year. Hardy was present, and proposed that there should be a delezate from each division of the society, to agree how to proceed. Mr. Fox has observed, in the House of Commons, that the people have aright to alter the government when they please ; the Scotch and the Irish have done it. The London Corresponding Society were first formed to send a delegate to all the other societies, to determine the best way of reform. The Friends of the People, in the Borough, still exist, and were determined to communicate with this, and other societies, and inuire into their intentions. It was agreed that a circular letter should be sent to all the societies in London, to meet, two or three from each, and come to some determination. The question to be debated at each division, What is the best way of proceeding 
EYRE 12368 Upon the 14th of February, 1793, the division, number twelve, chose Mr. Godfrey as a delegate, who was rejected, being lord George Gordon's attorney. My note is, that there was another man in the division, connected with lord George Gordon, who was rejected, To be determined at the next meeting, whether they were to petition parliament; and the observation is, that it will engage the public attention for the present. Agreed to demand a conference with the Constitutional Society: they are drawing up the state of the representation, and are going as far as us. The Friends of the People do not go so far. The Borough Society dues not go so far. Holborn Society say, they are for Republica: 
EYRE 12369 -nism. The Aldgate Society is Lroken up; and most of the members have joined the 
EYRE 12370 Corresponding Society. ‘There were about six socicties in London to confer with. A letter sent to the Constitutional Whigs at Sheflicld, saying, there will be a conference about this matter, and that they will write to them. Three questions would be proposed for consideration—whether to petition the king—to petition parliament—or to call a convention. It was remarked that it would be well to decline coming to any resolution till the whole nation are agreed. Margarot says, they should neither petition nor remonStrate; it would be unconstitutional. Reported that the Aldgate Society had thanked 
EYRE 12371 Ir. Fox for his speech, saying, that the people might alter the constitution, without giving their reasons. 
EYRE 12372 The next is a meeting of division number twenty-three, held on the 19th of February, in Crown-street. The question was agitated, which was the right age for election, eighteen, or twenty-one; which was put to the vote.

EYRE 12374 On the 21st of February, the delegates met at Compton-street. Godfrey, who had been Tejected and re-chosen, was rejected again, but insisted he would not quit the place; therefore they had no other way of getting rid of him, but by adjourning to Charles -street.

If this petition was rejected, they would write to their friends to continue, and then will be the time for all to unite, and to petition the king. The Fricnds of the People approve of Mr. Grey’s remonstrance. Reported that the bank's refusing to discount would assist the cause, by creating insolvency. A man pro posed to them, to subscribe to a book against imprisonment for debt; they refused to subscribe; but they agreed they would take ex tracts from it, that were worth publishing. There was a letter signed Jeremiah Carter, ar Curteis, the 15th of February, in answer tos letter of the first; and there was an answer to the Norwich Society, that they think the Friends of the People are friends to the cause.

EYRE 12379 On the 29th of April there was the anniversary dinner of the Constitutional Society, at the Crown and Anchor tavern, lord Sempill in the chair. The witness says they talked very Boldly, and laughed at the fears of the public, and were sure a revolution would take place in this country. Then come the toasts—the Rights of Man—may Despotism be trampled under the hoofs of the Swinish multitude, &c. On the 2nd of May, a delegate mecting, number thirty-one, Compton-street, eleven delegates present, Mr. Fox wrote to Hardy that the petition which had been brought to him went toa radical reform, by which would be understood universal suffrage, which he was not a friend to, but he would present the petition if we desired it; they then desired Mr. Francis to present it; two of the Shettield delegates that brought their petition were made honorary members; Mr. Fox’s note was produced, but nothing turns upon that. 
EYRE 12380 At a meeting on the 16th of May, number seven proposed to draw up a remonstrance against the war. It was said Hardy had received an anonymous letter. 
EYRE 12381 Atameeting on the 23rd of May, twelve delegates present. It was proposed to call a pore meeting; there was a letter from ittlejohn on the 18th of May—proposed to have a committee to prepare an address— notice was taken of Le Brun’s letter to lord Grenville; this might be thought to have come from some communication with France, and they waited to see what notice would be taken of that letter.

EYRE 12382 Upon the 6th of June a public meeting was advertised five for six; thanks were voted to Mr. Wharton for his speech—agreed to be printed, and comments to be made upon it; Margarot to get a thousand copies of Mr. Wharton’s speech. ‘The witness says he ceased to be a delegate from the 15th of June.

EYRE 12385 Then, gentlemen, you heard of an association at Lambeth, to learn the manual exercise; the plan was not matured; these were members of the Corresponding Society, who were desirous of learning the exercise. That memorandum respecting the association at Lambeth is so far material, that it speaks of that association as a thing that had been only then heard of for the first time, and had not originally proceeded from the committee of delegates. 
EYRE 12386 On the 12th of November a division meet. ing, number twenty-three. Read a letter from Norwich approving the convention at Edinburgh; that the finances are very low, and a second subscription is wanted to support the delezates in Scotland. There is a kind of memorandum, or sort of instruction for the delegates; a letter is sent to the delegates requesting them to visit all the societies in Scotland. The witness says, that at first he thought that what was said of the finances related to the Norwich Society; but lookin; again he rather thinks that it relates to his own society; reported that there was to be a second general meeting to he held at Edinburgh, but afterwards it w2s altered and intended to be held at Glasgow: there was a letter read, dated the 8th of November, from Hardy to the delegates in Scotland.

EYRE 12388 The next meeting is the 9th of January; he has not got Hardy’s name down at present, but believes he was there ; there was to be a general meeting on the 20th for dinner at the Globe; a sub-committee was appointed for the management of this meeting, the names put down for stewards were, Thelwall, Franklow, Agar, Kydd, Lovett, Hurrison, Stiff, Peacock, Harris, Sinclair, Powel, Williams, Mitchel, Pearce, Moore, Moffatt, Mar«.

EYRE 12390 The witness says he was at the meeting on the 20th of January at the Globe-tavern, Martin was president; when they were assembled the floor gave way; he was there before the business began; they went to a room above stairs, there were Martin, Ramsay, Richter, Thelwall, and Hardy there. The short-hand writer reported Margarot’s trial; an address to the nation was carried, and then they adjourned to dinner, Thelwall was chairman; the witness dined in an adjoining room; the witness came again into the large room soon after he had dined. 
EYRE 12391 There was a meeting of delegates at number three, New Compton-street, on the 23rd of January; the prisoner was there—agreed that hand-bills be stuck up, saying what grievances we wish to redress, The next thing that came forward was a box for the subscription for the support of the delegates in Scotland; it was opened that night, the amount was 13. 4s. 5d. and nine bad shillings; it was pet to publish the names of those who had given evidence against the patriots; this was objected to by Thelwall, as it might produce massacres. It was proposed at that time to choose two sub-delegates to attend the perpetual committee to watch the parliament every night; this proposal was Not carried; it was proposed that the committee should be made perpetual. 
EYRE 12392 Upon the 30th of January, a meeting of delegates, Hardy being present, division number eleven recommended to divide the metropolis into divisions; number thirteen moved to recommend it to those who are not members to subscribe; number eight wished to know if they should remove into the Borough, that press-gangs were about, and they had lost their business ; Thelwall moved to a point a permanent committee of delegates to consider of the measures to be pursued during the present posture of affairs, and to be a secret one; those of the general committee of delegates already chosen to be filled up by other delegates, to be invested with discretionary power to report to the committee of delegates, but the committee of delegates have power to dissolve them when they please; the secret committee were Martin, axter, Williams, Thelwall, and Moore. This secret committee were to consider what measures were to be adopted, and to call a general committee of delegates when they thought proper; a sub-committee of three proposed to consider of raising subscriptions for the delegates in Scotland, referred to the secret committee with full powers; Thelwall peo posed a committee of two as a committee exigence, to report to the general committee, but not to publish any thing—but this was withdrawn ; a letter stated from Bristol from old friends new revived. 
EYRE 12393 On the 6th of February, at a meeting of delegates, Hardy being present, a mobca from the permanent committee to appoint others who are not to be known. The witness’s memorandum is, that as it was dan gerous, they were to be dissolved, 2nd to name others, and their names not to be mentioned. 
EYRE 12394 Gentlemen, this shows you the progres: of this appointment of a committee; it had zone to the appointment of a secret committee, to act in the then posture of affairs; that the secret committee were afterwards dissolved 9 this extraordinary way, but they were to name another secret committee, whose names were Not to be known; so the business was to be conducted by a secret committee, who mizbt probably be the same persons, but could uot be known by any one to be the same persons, and the ground of it is, thatit was thought to be dangerous. What the secret committee were to do is matter of observation upon this extraordinary proceeding. A letter was re ceived in a parcel from Sheffield from Margarot, dated the 11th of January, and a letter was received from Gerrald for a short-hand writer to be sent down to take his trial. 
EYRE 12395 At a meeting on the 20th of February, number eighteen moved to reprint the Rights of Swine; a committee of seven are to revise the new constitution of the society ; resolved that 50,000 hand-bills of lord Stanhope’s speech respecting the foreign troops be priuted, and to return him thanks. After this time the witness says he ceased to be a delegate. He was then asked who and what be was; he describes himself to be an ionmonger, and to be in the commission hne; that he was first among this society by accident at the sign of the Mansion House, where he saw some of the resolutions of the society ; he told the landlord that this appeared to him to be a meeting to overturn the constitution, and advised him not to let them meet there any more, for if he did that he would have his licence taken from him. He says he went into the room and conversed with Watson; he refers to a paper which the landlord sbowed him which was the resolutions and address of the society. , 
EYRE 12396 Upon his cross-examination, he says farther, that he is in the commission line, and has done business -from Birmingham and Sheffield; he says he is now epelying ie business in the East Indialine; he has seven years in this way in a small d however he did a great deal of business lat season; he had a warehouse in Wood-street, he removed from one house in Wood-street to another, and from thence to Walbrook, where he has been ever since; he has not been in theretail way since he left Alexander Shrimpton and Company; that the resolutions and addresses were first published upon the twentyfourth of May 1792; he says that when he was tried for being a spy, there was nothing Particular brought forward against him. In that month, he says, he went into Staffordshire and Yorkshire for some time; that he consulted with a friend, who recommended to him to makea reportot these transactions, and he has done so from time to time; he thinks the first report he made was on the first of} October, 1792; he made his reports to one whom he was certain would communicate those reports toa proper channel, but that Rerson was not a magistrate ; he says he put own every thing he could; that it was his duty to do so, for he was to report to his own division, and he gave the same reports to his division, according to his notes, as he had given into thatchannel by which he meant to make a discovery of all that had passed. 
EYRE 12397 Gentlemen, it has been a fatiguing work to go through these broken accounts of the transactions of the society from this man’s Motes, and the accounts must necessarily be somewhat imperfect; but upon the whole they carry with them very great marks of authenticity; and with respect to those facts which can be clearly collected from them, they scem to be very weightily proved, and I cannot imagine that the evidence of this man is shaken in any particular whatever, from the mere circumstance of a man, otherwise of credit, choosing to give information of proceedings which he conceived to be dangerous to the constitution of the country; to say that thatis to affect his credit, 1s not a thing to be asserted in a court of justice, nor fit to be encouraged by a jury. Wherever men of this description give evidence, and they give their evidence ina way which is fairly open to observation, the circumstance of their coming to give their evidence in this manner will have its weight, but if their evidence in other respects is uniformly consistent and probable, and is not impeached, it is not cnough to say that this man went inte this society on purpose to inform the magistrate of what was passing. It is extremely necessary that should be done; it is the duty of magistrates to watch over the public peace, if any thing material is going forward by which the public peace of the country may be affected; it is the duty of the magistrate to use all proper means to bring these proceed-ings to light, in order that they may be brought to the test of the law; and he would be criminal if he did not use those means. 
EYRE 12398 The next witness is Maclean; he produces a letter found upon Adams, the secretary of the Constitutional Society, dated the thirteenth of October, 1792, from the editor of ; the Patriot at Sheffield, directed to John An-drews, secretary to the Society of the Friends of Universal Peace and the Rights of Man, at Stockport. 
EYRE 12399 This letter, though of a pretty old date, seems to have deserved attention; it shows the extraordinary diligence and attention with which the making prosclytes to this cause, was pursued in that part of the country, as well as in many others. That letter and the answer to it must be read. 
EYRE 12400 Gentlemen, the next witness is John Coates ; he says he is an apprentice to Franklow, who lived at number one, China Walk, Lambeth; he says he was bound apprentice in November last; that Franklow used to be out late of nights; that there used to be exercising with tire arms up stairs twice a week, about eight o’clock in the evening; that Shelmerdine and Williams were two of the persons who used to be there, there were about eight or nine of them; he supposes them to be the same persons, the window shutters were shut; his master used to go to Worcester-street, in the Borough, he does not know what he did there; he says the arms they used at his master’s house were kept on the first floor, he did not know where they were put after his master was apprehended ; he remembers seeing cartouch boxes in the cutting room, they ‘lay upon the board; he once saw his master in regimentals, and that Williams had a uniform, he saw his master in regimentals one Sunday morning in the house. 
EYRE 12401 James Walsh was at Chalk-farm when Richter read the resolutions; he heard the word convention mentioned by him, and that they had formed a correspondence with different societies in different towns; that was all he could speak to, except that two hundred thousand copiesof the resolutions were to printed; and he says that Thelwall spoke very violently. 
EYRE 12402 Thomas Green was the next witness; he says he isa perfumer, that he also deals in knives and cutlery ware; he says it is customary for perfumers to deal in such articles ; he says he had knives with a catch in the back, he had three dozen of them from Sheffield, packed in small parcels, he sold fourteen of them, he can name three or four persons who bought single knives, one was the prisoner at the bar, and that he sent him six others ina package; that he was to make choice of one, and if he could dispose of the rest he might; he did not book them, and four of them were returned after Hardy was apprehended, he had not called on him before ; he said he sold one to one Mr. Billington, and one to Groves; he had them from Scotheld and Company, at Sheftield; that he had dealt with another person in Sheffield; they have riders; one happened to bring patterns of this kind of knife, which before he had seen in shops in the Strand, and other places, and so he ordered a parcel; he says ho docs not know how Hardy came to know that he had them; he says that in Compton-street he ate his supper with one of these knives,Pearce had another which was rather better Gnished, and which he had not bought of the witness. 
EYRE 12403 Upon his cruss-exanination, he says he used such a kuife as this seven years ago ; that he has tweuty of the three dozen he bought left now; most cutler’s shops have them ; that he sold them in the common ! 
EYRE 12404 course of his trade. As to Groves, he says he came to purchase a knife, and he remarked the utility of the knife; he did not tell Groves that he had suld two or three hundred of them, but Groves asked him if le had sold many, he told him yes, he not liking to discourage the sale of his own goods; he says he did not desire Groves to speak low, because the parlour door was open, and his wife was a damned aristocrat, he did not use such ao expression; he did nut desire Groves to speak low; that the knives lay openly in the glass case for sale; he says he did not keep them to scll to mischievous people, and he does not recollect saying a word about his wife, or using the word aristocrat, and that he never wished to conceal from his wife that he sold these knives. 
EYRE 12405 Now here, undoubtedly, there is a flat contradiction between him and Groves; they are both witnesses called on the part of the crown; they certainly put you under a dilemma, and make it difficult for you to be satisfied that Groves is a person who is entitled to credit for what he has said; at the same time though Groves is contradicted in this particular by this witness, he is contradicted in no other particular where witnesses might have been called to contradict him, that is a circumstance for your consideration, upon j : , i members the fact of their dispersion—he says which you will exercise your judgment, I am not not at all pressing you to incline to give more credit to a witness who has been contenor of his evidence upon the whole entitles him to. The next witness, is Edward Hodson, a printer; he declined answering whether he ‘ 
EYRE 12406 printed a particular paper which was shown to him, but he admits that one Hodgson applicd to him to print it, and brought the manuscript. It is a hand-bill respecting the Ins and Outs, that we are in danger from the French, and from the Hessians and Hanoverians, in cither case we should get arms, and learn how to use them—you recollect the paver, -He says, that from all he observed, has no reason to suppose that they had any thing but areform ot parliament in view, that it was no part of their plan to attack the king, he never heard any such thing, or to displace the Lords—he would not-have continued a moment longer in ihe society, if he had supposed any such thing. He says, that upon Hardy and Adams being taken up, and reports being in circulation, ES A A ET 
EYRE 12407 “ See p. 837. 
EYRE 12408 that under pretence of reform, they bad other objects in view, he left them—be sis he understuod the Convention was a th sz not determined upon—that they were to take the advice of the societies in the country, whether they were to assemble a conven —he says there was no idea of their makmng laws, or introducing the anarchy of Frauce into England—he became a member im the month of February—he says he has read printed copy of the resolutions at Chalk-tarm, e has seen a printed copy of the pirceedings on the twentieth of January; he DO thing of their having any thing to d with the works of Paine—that several peorie applied to him to priat the proceedinz at 
EYRE 12409 ; Chalk-farm. 
EYRE 12410 The next witness, is George Ross, of Ecmburgh; he says he became a member of the Society of the Friends of the People in Ed:0burgh, about the end of the year 1793 ; that he was a member of the British Conventwa; he says he made a mistake at first, as to the year, it was in 1792, thathe was made a member; that at the end of November, the beginning of December, 1793, the delegates from other socicties in Scotland attended, and some from England; he says he re ceived some letters from one Stock, in Edm burgh, who was a member of another socet: of the same nature; he says he sent several of thenrinto the country; onetoa 0 of the name of Miller, at Perth, which is now produced; he sent one to Strathaven, and one to Paisley; he is not certain whether be sent one to Dundee; he cannot be certain whether he was present at the vote of unto that they came to in the Convention, whes they extended their hands; he says he reis the the circular letter produced which was sent by him, to diffarent parts of tradicted in one particular, than the whole Scotland. 
EYRE 12411 Upon his cross-examination he says, that his only object was, a reform in the House of Commons, he never thought there was an intention to attack the king’s person, or his prerogatives; they did not at all consider themselves as the parliament of Great Ba tain, but they meant to consider of proper means of petitioning; he says he perceived nothing of any other intent; nothing was said against the king, that he heard; he says it would have been foolish enough to attempt to make laws to bind the people—he says the British Convention consisted of about two hundred persons—they had no arms to at tack the magistrates ; there was no prepara tion of the means for resistance : he said they had nothing illega] in their thoughts ; if they had thought it illegal, they would not have done it, or if they hal thought it dangerous to the king, they would not have done it He says the Convention consisted of le of all ranks, smpstly people of good character, people of sober lives and good morals; says he does not recollect being present ata patculer resolution inquired after; he says, thinks he was present when the resolution was come to about the Habeas Corpus Act, to meet at a place to be appointed by thesecret committee. He says, Downie was a member of the society; he understood theConvention of Emergency to be called to pe- , tition parliament; that he would not have agreed te a convention upon any other terms; that he understood they were to specify a particular refurm in their petition. 
EYRE 12412 Arthur McEwan says, he lives at the Water of Leith, he remembers the dispersion ef the ; convention by the magistrates; that a large committee of union met in consequence of it, of which Watt was a member; there was another committee, a sub-committee, called a committee of Ways and Means; that Stock, Bourke, Aitcheson, Bonthron, Downie, Watt, and hiinself, were of that coinmittee, to look into the affairs of Skirving ; he never saw theletter inquired after. 
EYRE 12413 He says, that Watt read to them a plan to seize the lord justice Clerk, and the rest ofthe lords of council and session, and the lordprovost of Edinburgh; to kindle a fire at the ; Excise-office, in the New Town, and that par-ties should be stationed in the street, to intercept the soldiersas they came down from ! the castle; the fire was todraw the military from the castle; coming down to a point, ; they were to be inclosed by two parties; that different parties were to seize the banking houses in Edinburgh, and commissionerswere to be appointed to demand the cash , from the banks; he did not know who were to execute this, only the sub-committee were j present when this was disclosed ; the witnesssaid, he objected to all this, he would not! agree to any thing that should disturb the peace, or shed the blood of his countrymen; that Bonthron agreed with him, and no farther communication was made at that time. He says, atanother meeting Watt produced a copy of a proclamation, prohibiting the removal of corn, grain, hay, and meal; that persons were not to remove the same from ! their respective places of abode; there was a copy of an address to the king, ordering himto dismiss his present ministers, and to putanend to this bloody war, or else he might expect bad consequences to ensue—this was to be sent to the king, on the morning afterthe attack. The witness said, these things did not belong to the cause of a reform, andhe would have nothing to do with it. 
EYRE 12414 He says, he went with Watt, to Robert ; Orrock’s, to bespeak pikes; Orrock sketched out one, Watt said, he had four thousand to send to Perth, besides what he had to distribute about Edinburgh; Stock was of the committee, he said he was going to London, or Bristol, and would wait on Hardy by the desire of Watt, who proposed to send a [etter to Hardy; Stock undertook to take this letpondence was to be conducted, something wag to signify, that the aristocrats were doing so and so, and the democrats so and so; Stock was to call again upon Watt; the witness saw him no more, 
EYRE 12415 Upon his cross-examination he says, that parliamentary reform was the object of the society; that the society to which he belonged, consisted of about twenty; that he attended the convention about half, a dozen: 
EYRE 12416 nights ; that they meant to obtain a parliamentary retorm, by a petition, and that it was to have come under consideration, the night they were dispersed. You see there was a scroll of a petition brought forward, and & negative put upon it, in a certain way, by calling for the order of the day; but in that story of his he must be mistaken; he says it was to come under consideration the night of the dispersion; that there were near two hundred members; that they had no arms he never heard of an intention to use force ; that the rctorm most of them spoke of, was universal suffrage, and annual parliaments, and some were for triennial parliaments; he says, there was nothing said, touching the King, or the Lords; he cannot undertake to say, what that committee of union was for, he did not hear that it was for the purpose of establishing a new convention ; he says Skirving’s letter was read at a meeting, and a sube committee appointed. He says, he heard the delegates were to lave another convention, of the time, and place of meeting of which, they were to get information ; he could not say as to the purposes of the new convention. 
EYRE 12417 William Middleton says, he searched the’ house of Watt, on the fifteenth of May, but nothing turns upon that. 
EYRE 12418 Gentlemen, this was the evidence they gave of a conspiracy breaking out in Scotland, after the dispersion of the cunvention, which it is insisted upon by the attorney general, makes a part of this general plan, in this country; that by possibility, Hardy's circular letter, or some other of Hardy’s publications, or the publication of the Sheffield committee, or of the Constitutional Society might have excited this, is certainly true, and therefore the evidence could not be rejected ; but as to the bringing home to the prisoner, Hardy, that he was implicated directly in this conspiracy, the evidence docs not appear to me to go that length, for all the conversation ahout a letter to be carried by Stock to Hardy, comes to nothing, for Stock never did deliver that letter; Muargarot and Gerrald,. who were delegates with Hardy’s participation from the Corresponding Society, do not appear to have been involved in this conspiracy—they were, I believe, in custody at the time, and upon the whole, therefore, that does rather seem to have been something that broke out in consequence of the general irritationwhich had been so improperly produced by ter. Stock took a slip of paper, and gavethe pains that had been taken throughout the him some token by which this same corres-country to irritate it; but I do not see any thing that makes it probable, that Hardy, personally, was concerned in this part of the conspiracy, or that he knew any thiag at all about it. 
EYRE 12419 Gentlemen, the next witness, Schaw, produces a paper, found upon Thelwall, and Nost produces a paper, fount! upon Martin; these two papers are proved to have been Martin’s hasdaecliivng they were found after Hardy’s apprehension; but they become evidence even in this ease, against Hardy, from the eircumstance of their having been proved, by two witnesses, to have been in Martin's possession, before Hardy was apprehended ; they were, therefore, papers that existed before that time. 
EYRE 12420 Now this paper purports to be projected fesolutions for the meeting at Chalk-farm ; they differ essentially from the resolutions that were agreed to, and appear to be of a more direct and violent east than those resolutions were, because they point immediately to the person of the king; it will be proper that you should hear that paper now’read, 
EYRE 12421 ‘ Gentlemen, what is conveyed by that last rosolution? That itis the bounden duty of the people to punish all traitors against the nation, and that the following words are now not a part of the oath of allegiance—‘ That it is not lawful to take arms against the king ; a more dangerous and more treasonable paer, one has hardly ever scen: of this paper have to remark, that there is no evidence which directly brings it home o the prisoner, Hardy, but the evidence stands thus—This has been manifestly a draught of a resolution which, in the mind of the drawer, was intended for a meeting of the London Corresding Society, about that time ; the date to 
EYRE 12422 Wt is the fourteenth of April; upon that fourteenth of April the Chalk-farm resolutions were proposed; the paper was found upon Thelwall, who was present at the Chalk-farm Meeting, aud taking an active part there; suoh a paper, therefore, found upon Thelwall and Martin, two members of this society, seems bubtco manifestly to prove what the ideas were that were floating in the minds of these people, at the time of those resolutions; and they certainly show, that very dangerous designs were coneeived by some of those people, to be brought forward, at that time, In some shape er other: how it was settled— in what consultation—by what persons—there is no direct evidence; that you can only gaess at; they are persens that usually transacted the business for this Corresponding Society; you know who they were; Hardy was a principal one
EYRE 12424 (iss these persons, there was danger, of the ma alarming degree: of violence, that one as hardly ventute to contemplates it leads to: Gegree of wickedness, that one could Hardy suppose to be possible
EYRE 12426 The first witness is Florimond Geddy; he says, he is 2 member of the London Caresponding Society; he was of the same & vision as Hardy, number two; he says, bextended very regularly; he dves net keor that he missed ange for two years; hess. that he ceased to be a member when Hatr was taken us that Hardy was very nny absent; that he was perfectly well acquaint with him; that he hardly ever miss i upon him on a Sunday; that he wasar markably peaceable man ; a friend to orde: that when the meetings were dis , Har desired that they would not even sign with them ; that his object was a pari tary reform in the House of Commons, ai that it was no part of his view ta make ay alteration in the House of Lords ; that be meant nothing agamst the Crown; God fu bid that he should; that there were frequat conversations upon political subjects, whid he had with Hardy ; that curiosity induced him to ask a number of questions, and Never supposed the prisoner had any views different from his; he says, he never heard ci the letter trom Sheffield about pikes; that hs brother introduced hjm ; he was at the Globe tavern; and at Chalk-farm; that every thiog was very peaceable; that there were soxe resolutions in print, and that the paper co tained a cprrect account of what passed; be thought that all that was transacted, at bob places, was agreeable to the law of the land. 
EYRE 12427 He says, it is true, that the society sent de legates to the Scotch Convention; that bisself was notin office; he has heard ofa secret committee ; he never heard who thcy were; he ducs not think that the body knew who the secret committee were ; he knew nothing of their proceedings, and he did not choose 1 attend after Hardy was taken up
EYRE 12429 The only observation that occurs to me, upon this man’s evidence is, the distance at which he seems to have been kept from all knowledge of what was doing; there was a secret committee, which seem to have managed all the material concerns of the society; end it is remarkable, that this person whe was connected with Hardy, did noteven know ery thing with regard to the cireumstance of the pikes; whetier Hardy’s not communicattug it happened mercly by accident, which I think most probable, or whether there was any reason tor not letting this man into the business of the pikes, is a goed deal uncertain, wpon this state of the evidence; but, if other people were let into it, why this man was not as not easy to see. 
EYRE 12430 Francis Dowling says, he was a member of this suciety, and belonged to Hardy’s division; their only object was, a reform in the House of Commons; they had no thoughts against the King or the House of Lords; they had no idea of opposing the government by force. The object of the convention, he says, was, to the sense of the delevates, from different ivisions, to obtain a reform in the House of Commons, and that there was no intention of proceeding by feree in any meraler of the society ; he says, that he was two years and a half ia the division, and never saw or heard of a letter, from Sheftield, about pikes; he was a member of this society from the commencement ef it: he says, be dined at the Crown and Anchor, on the second of May; there was some music, buthe dees not know what it was. He says, he was at Chalk Farm; he saw the resolutions at the Globe-tavern, but lee does not recollect what they were; he was once delegate, tor six months; he ceased to be se, five or six months ago. 
EYRE 12431 He says, he knew Speuce’s shop ; he bought pamphicts there; he has scen Franklow there, but never heard of any exercising there, till he heard of it now ; hesays, he hus heard of a committee of correspondence; if there was one, it was voted by ballot; he knows Hodgson the hatter; he knows nothing of any seeret committee being appointed, after the apprehension of Hardy; that he has never been in Academy-court, Chancery-lane; he never heard of the Shefield letter, till he saw it in the report ef the secret committee; he never heard of the order to stick the bills up in the aight; Carter, who stuck up the bills, received the money ; whether the bill was criminal he eapnet tell; he did not hear all the conof ae resolutions ; the fee conduct ie people, he says, at Cha ‘arm was pasiestic, then, he ony he voted for the resokstions, without hearing them distinctly, but that others attended to them; that he eted because ethers did; that is a way in: which the majority in these essemblics, I aare say, was very often obtained. f 
EYRE 12432 Alexander Wills edys, he was between two atid three years a member of the Correspond-. ing Society; he says, the object of the society was a parliamentary reform in the House of Commons ; that they were full of respect, honour, and fidelity, to the king; he never had reason to think others intended otherwise ; never to his knowledge, was it intended to do any thing by force; thathe would! not have continued in the society, if there had been eny istention of doing any thing by force ; he has not been 8 member of the society since the king of France suffered ; that the prisoner is of an amiable charaeter, and a good member of society. 
EYRE 12433 The witness says, he id 2 dancing-master ; he is also a member of the Constitutional 80ciety; he was introduced by Heleroft, after he became a member of the Constitutional Societys he wished to hear speakers that were clever men; he took his rule of polities from news-pepers, from public report, and from debates in both Houses of Parliament ; he was but little acquainted with the proceedings; he did not see the books at the meetings; he never knew any of their transactions, which might bring the people or those they ethployed, into any difficulties; he may, he says, have given a shilling, or five shillings, a guinea, two guineas, or five guineas, te assist Carter ; he says, he often gives five guineas, and he does not know whom he gives it to; then, when pressed a little, he says, he might have given some shillings, if not guineas; at last he said, he did not give guineas, but he did give a few shillings; he says, he was asked, in one of the societies, to contribute, in Compton-street ; he says, he is not sure he gave more thaa that. He never heard of a seeret committee, or committee of correspondence, and never saw any letter that been written to the prisoner. I think, notwithstanding that strange Hourish of his, about the five guineas, one may sately conclude that there was no harm in this wite ness. 
EYRE 12434 Archibald Hunter was a member of the London Corresponding Society about twenty months; he knows the prisoner; he belonged to the same division with Hardy ; he says, the object of the society was, to obtain a parliamentary reform; he never understuod any thing else but a reform in the Commons House of Parliament; the King, and the House of Lords, to remain as they were; he 
EYRE 12435 Never heard of force out of the Report; he says, there was no intention to atlack the vernment of the country; that Hardy was a peaceable, respectable, quiet man; he says, Hardy never produced any letter at the divie sien, about pikes, nor communicated it, to his knowledge; he continued a member of the society; he was introduced by Joseph Hupter; be did not attend very regularly, being ae ea out ef town. 
EYRE 12436 eays, he was at Chalk Farm, and at the Globe-tavern ; he understood theit proceady angs were peaceable; he heard the resolu-Mr. Daniel Stuart is secretary to the coaions read, but did not attend to them; he didmittee of the Society of the Friends of u& not vote for them; he says, that from thePeople, in Frith-street; he says, he has sea inattention which pervades his whole conduct, Hardy frequently —In December, 1799, th he couldnot keep up hisattention to hear whatLondon Corresponding Society sent a lete they were
EYRE 12438 he came to London; that he was’ one of his congregation ; that he is a very respectable character, and as far as connected with him in a religious suciety, he can speak to his character ; his moral conduct is good; that he is a man of conscience towards God and man. Peter Macbean, a shoe-maker, says, he has known Hartly seventeen years; that he is of avery amiable character, both civil and religious; a peaccable, quiet, well-disposed man
EYRE 12440 Bell, in Exeter-street, before the society was formed ; he was no delegate; he does not recollect who was the fitst chairman ; Margarot might be for any thing he knew; he believes Hardy to be one of the first that met; and a person of the name of Black, and a Mr. Gow, who is since dead; that there was no clergyman or physician among them; that there were thirty or forty, or more, when they met the greatest number; the first time he came, perhaps, there might be twenty; he believes Margarot was the principal man in forming the original laws, but he cannot recollect who assisted. 
EYRE 12441 Alexander Gordon, a shoe-maker, says, he has known the prisoner twenty years; that he fsa sober, honest, industrious, peaceable man. 
EYRE 12442 John Bogue, a carpenterand cabinet-maker, says be has known the prisoner near ten years; that he is an industrious, honest, christian man. 
EYRE 12443 Mathew Dickey, a Scotch factor, says, he has known the prisoner upwards of five ycars; that he is a strictly honest, upright man; their intercourse was entirely upon business, 
EYRE 12444 Jatnes Hardy says, he is not related to the prisoner; he lives in Smithfield; he has known him from 1779, or 1780; he gives him the best of characters. 
EYRE 12445 They then call Mr. King, and the purpose for which they call Mr. King was, to show, that a letter, which was enclosed to Hardy, in Davison’s letter, which Davison’s letter, you recollect, propused to Hardy a plan for furnishing the society, or any one that wanted them, with pikes, from Sheflicld; in that letter, a letter to a society at Norwich was sent enclosed; Mr. King is not able to speak exactly to it, but he says, he does recollect the circumstance of a letter being found, unopened at the time, but he cannot take upon him to say, whether that was the Norwich letter or no. David Martin, of Sheffield, says, he is a member of a society there, for a reform in the Commons House of parliament, by legal and constitutional means; he says, that-he had no reason to believe that the object of ’ -any other person, was different from his; . he e has been a mem- ! 
EYRE 12446 had not the most distant idea of doing any thing by force; he says, they sent delegates to Scotland, to co-operate with other delegates, to obtain a reform, by a petition to parlament; he says, they hoped the effect of a general co-operation, would be sufficient to induce the parliament to grant the petition ; that it was not their design to compel by force; he says, he would not have remained in the society, if it had; he had no intention to attack the King, nor to attack the Lords; he says, he knows a person of the name of Gale, he was an active man in the society, he believes he is not row at Sheffield, he has no house there; the witness was made an associated memLer of the Constitutional Society, in 1792; he has heard of the proceedings of the Scotch Convention, he saw an account of them in the Gazetteer of Edinburgh, he did not approve of that part relating to a secret committee—he says, being at the outside of the people, on the Castle-hill, he did not hear the lution to petition the House of Commons no more—he says, Yorke and he had not exactly the same opinion, as toa plan of reform in parliament; he does not know who are the editors uf the Patriot, but has heard that Brown was one, which Brown was a delegate to the Scotch Convention; he thought him a peaceable, and welldisposed man ; he says, there were letters between their society, and the Stockport Society, and he thought they also were peaceably disposed
EYRE 12448 He says, he remembers hearing about pikes, that their society had great apprehensions of danger from the opposite party, that they had been threatened and ill used by the opposite party, and by individuals, who took upon themselves an authority that they had no right tu; this was complained of in the society ; he says, that it never was designed or agitated to arm, as a body, to attack the vernment; if it had been, he should we known it
EYRE 12450 The witness admitted the letters to be Ashton’s hand-writing, and signed by him ; it says they were resolved to obtain a. radical zeferm of the country, as soon as prudence nd discretion weill Pormutt 3 and they request that the villages and towns may unite in the sentiments expressed by Paine. The witness says, he never read that letter at all; he does not know that it was ever communicated to him ; he does net know whether it might be communicated to the eocicty, because he did Rot attead all their meetings ; he says there is the Register and the Patriot, published weekly in Sheflicld—He is shown some printed resolutions, thanking Paine for his two: 
EYRE 12451 the Rights of Man ; he says he believes thete eesohitions were circulated in Sheffield, and that the books were -circuleted in Sheffield ; 
EYRE 12452 Serine ey the First and Second Part of that they were sold to vatiouS persom,: town and country, and by some of the me bers of this society; that probably the me ber of the members of the society might about two hundred; that the umber mo tioned in this paper, namely, two thowsx might be taken from the number of re that attended the meetings; he says, thir expected, if there was any corruption in tx House of Lords, the reformation there wu! follow, of course, from a reform in the Hoe of Commons. He says, that Martin, the les witness, signed these resolutions. —Ths witness says there was no concealment tht lx knows of ; that many of their procectogs were published. 
EYRE 12453 Daniel Stuart is called again ; he cays, te bad a letter from the Sheffield Society, sigv!

ATTORNEYGENERAL 12454 I asked Mr. Stu, upott his cross-examination, if he knew ds letter of the 26th of May, which bed ba sent to the Constitutional Society, if you wt ship has no objection, I think this wills proper place to read it in. 
EYRE 12455 Let it be real. 
EYRE 12456 (See p. 1111.] 
EYRE 12457 Mr. Stuart sys he never heard of this letter of the 26th May, to the Constitutional Society, and thinks he did not know at the time of any their members having been associated the Constitutional Society ; he was sstedato some gentlemen having left the Sead the Friends of the People, and he says bee had, and that other members bave bem added to that society ; he was asked lee whe ther lord Daer, a member of the Bdebugh Convention, had been expelled from theaciety, he says he is still a member.

EYRE 12459 them; he savs, he has heard people speak of itl-treating the society; that there were inHammatory letters in the Sheffield papers from one Russell ; he says, however, he is almosta stranger to the pike business, as to the general object, ifit had been to have armed, it roust have been known to him, he must have heard of it, the question was never agitated in the committee, or in the society ; he never heard of any intention to resist, or to attack government, he had no such object himself, and he has reasonable hope that the society had not; he says, the society published the duke of Richmond’s letter toinform the societies at large of the principles they meant to go upon, and they adhered strictly to those principles. 
EYRE 12460 Upon his cross-examination he says, the object was, all along, to obtain a reform by petition; that that was negatived on the Castlehill, he heard no voice in the affirmative; he says he remained a member of the society, after that; he has some recollection of a vote of approbation of the proceedings of the Scotch Convention, but he was not then present; he says, he did not know of the contrivance to have the vote for the petition negatived, neither from Broomhead nor Camage, and he has had correspondence with Broomhead for fifteen years; he says, he did not know that any petition to his majesty was prepared ; he says he can form no belief as to the hand-writing of Ashton. ‘ 
EYRE 12461 Edward Smith, a cutler in Sheffield, says, he was a member of the society in 1791; that their object was, to obtain a parliamentary reform upon the duke of Richmond's plan, io his letter tocolonel Sharman ; he understood by the expression Rights of Man in their letters, equal re prereaIAUOn in parliament in the House of Commons; he never heard any thing in the society that they wished to attack the king's title or his prerogative, but much the other way, nor to to touch the dignity of the House of Lords ; he meantto have, as he strangely expressed it the glorious advantages obtained In 1688; that he heard nothing of force, he heard nothing of arms ’till the hand-bill that threatened them; that upon any good news they used to fire there was nothing to provoke this conduct ; that there wis no regular arming ; he says if they had determined to arm, Sheffield could in one day have furnished ten thousand pikes ; that it never was his wish or object in becoming a member of that society, to touch or aifect his sovereign. 
EYRE 12462 Upon his cross-examination, he says, that he thought it necessary to provide arms for his own defence; he does not know how many did; he says, as to himself, he made ho application to any magistrate, he says it jvas put into the Register, a public newspaper at Sheffield, that they advised people to arm to assist the magistrates, the advice was to istols into their houses; that invasion, that being the substance of the hand-bill, which they understood to be against them, they adopted similar words; he says, that by equal representation, he means that every man was to have his vote; he had read both editions of the Rights of Man by Mr. Paine; he obtained them bya subscription of a few friends; that there were many that had them; that they thought well of them; that they seldom read them at the society, but they read them at their own houses ; they also had other cheap publications; he says, he was not at the meeting when they approved of Paine’s works; that he never took into consideration Paine’s notions of monarchy; that the society did not adopt that, but they made no protest against it; that they did not wish to destroy monarchy; he understood the author to be expressing disaffection; he says, he knew Yorke at Shefficld, he was at the Castle-hill, they voted by holding up hands; he never heard of the address from the society to France. 
EYRE 12463 His grace the duke of Richmond is then called, in order to identify a paper which is represented to be his grace’s plan for a reform of parliament; he could not identify that paper, but produced a paper purporting to be a letter to a colonel Sharman, containing a plan fora reform of parliament, and that letter was read. ‘The plan was for universal suffrage and annual election, and it stated that the remedy—that the “nf to obtain it would be by the people : he did not expressly name a convention of the people, but, however, he certainly said enough to put that expedient into the heads of those who were eager for such a plan. 
EYRE 12464 Mr. Stuart is then called again; he says, that he has heard Hardy state his plan to be universal suffrage and annual parliaments ; the witness always objected to it, but that was Hardy's opinion, he always adhered to the duke of Richmond's plan—he said, that was the whole object of his society; he was once in company with him at supper, he found him a sincere, simple, honest man; he says he did not know that he had been an associated member of the Constitutional Society. 
EYRE 12465 Mr. Sterling produced the minutes of 3 Scotch borough convention, but they could not be read. 
EYRE 12466 Joseph Strutt of Derby, says, he belonged to a society there; that a reform in the Commons House of Parliament was their object, they had no design against the King, or the House of Lords, and they had no intention te bring about that reform by force; that upon their petition being rejected, their society never met again. 
EYRE 12467 Mr. Sheridan was then called; he says, ke once saw the prisoner, that it was in the b ginning of March, 1793; be had given notice of an intention to bring forward an inquiry in atm against domestic enemies and forei arliament into the cause of the alarms at 5 gn? 
EYRE 12468 that time ; -that upon that occasion he sent to Hardy, who, he understood, could give him information; he came to him, and he conversed with him; Hardy stated his whole object to be obtainin, reform on the duke of Richmond’s plan, and that he was reddy to give him a sight of his whole correspondence, to produce all his papers to him, that he might lay them before parliament in any manner that he should think fit; he was asked whether he was or not an original member of the Constitutional Society, he said he was, but he had not attended since 1783; there were some questions whether Mr. Sheridan had said any thing of books, as well as papers, whether Hardy offered him books as well as papers; afterwards he said he could not take upon him to be sure that Hardy mentioned books ; that his offer was, to put him in possession of all the papers. 
EYRE 12469 r. Francis was then called; he saw Mr. Hardy twice, firstat his own house, and afterwards at Mr. Francis’s house; the Corresponding Society had thanked Mr. Francis for a speech he had made in parliament in the year 1793, and had expressed a desire that it should be printed ; upon that occasion he saw Mr. Hardy: he says, before that time Hardy had been sent to hi. to desire him to present a potition on the subject of a reform in parliament; that they wished their delegates might be admitted to come to his house, accordingly they were admitted, and they brought a petition—there were four of them; he told them he objected to the prayer of their petition, which was for universal representation according to the duke of Richmond’s plan; he says, that Hardy seemed a remarkably reasonable, quiet man; that they were very ready at the argument in support of universal suffrage, they said they only followed the opinions of the duke of Richmond ; he says, he told them they should have left the remedy in general terms to the wisdom of the house; they said they were sorry they had not known that sooner, but that now they could not alter it, as the petition was signed by a great number of people, and must be presented that day, because Mr. Grey was that day to make his motion. 
EYRE 12470 Mr. Francis says, they did not declare that they would accept nothing else, but they appeared to him to adhere to universal representation, There isa little puzzle about a letter which had been written to Mr. Francis, and his answer ; they had in that letter thanked him for what he had said about a radical reform on a broad basis; he says that was not exactly the tenor of his speech, but he did not think it right to enter into rnuch altercation upon the subject, he gave them a civil answer, and there it ended.

EYRE 12473 The Earl of Lauderdale-says, he receiveds letter from the Society of the Friends s the People at Portsburg, near Edinburgh; that he saw Skirving upon that occas, and he supposes the application was mx to him in consequence of a conversatxa with Skirving ; Skirving represented that ther wished to have men of education, that thes might be prevented from falling into absrditics, which they should otherwise be lable to fall into; he says, he had no reason ta suspect that any thing more was meant than to obtain Universal Suffrage and Annual Parliaments; he heard nothing of force, and has No reason to think there was any intertwa of force. He was asked if he had beard wy thing of Skirving’s letter to Hardy in Jak, 1793, which is a remarkable letter, his lord ship says he had not; this, I think, is the evidence on the part of the defendant. 
EYRE 12474 Gentlemen, I would, if the day were not s far spent, and my own strength too much ehausted, now go on and finish what I haves say upon this subject, but I foresee it mast necessarily run into an inconvenient length, both to myself and to you; and, therefore, 1 believe I must trouble you to attend to-morrow morning, and then I shall hope in a tew hous to release you. 
EYRE 12475 Gentlemen of the Jury ; Last night, at a late hour, I finished the summing up of the parol evidence, and some parts of the written evidence, which seemed to be more immediately connected with the parol evidence on both sides, except that I aid not state to you the protest in the House of Lords, which was read to you, by the consent of the attorney general, on the part of the prisoner. I did not state it to you at that time, because it did not appear to me to be in its mature evidence. It is something that has passed in the Parliamentary History of this country, from whence arguments might be drawn, on the part of the prisoner, to evidence the purity honesty of bis intentions, and, in my judgment, it is in thet lew nay that itcan be made use of in hs ehalf. 
EYRE 12476 Having thus finished the summing up of the evidence, I may say to you, that this cause, this great and momentous caus be tween the king and the prisoner at the bar, is at length brought to the point of conclusion; and it must be a satisfaction to the mind of every honest man that this cause has been so conducted, has been proceeded upon, and has been attended to by you with so much patience and temper, that there is reason to expect that your minds have been sufficiently intourmed on the subject to enable you to discover its true merits, and to pronounce a verdict, which in the first place will be satisfactory to your own consciences, and as such, cannot but be satisfactory lo the cominunity. 
EYRE 12477 Gentlemen, it is as great a satisfaction to me, as I can feel in the exercise of so paintul aduty as that which has been cast upon me, to reflect that upon this occasion there is, I think, no possible chance of our being entangled in any difficulties in point of law. The verdict in this case, will not proceed, and ou will receive no directions from me that it ought to proceed, on any narrow or technical rounds. The overt-act charged in this indictment, is in substance, that the prisoner at the bar, and those who have been concerned with him, have cunspired to depose the king, and to subvert the monarchy of this country; and this is charged, and always has been considered, as an overt-act of the treason of compassing the death of the king. Itis indeed a known presumption of law, acknowledged by the best writers upon the law, and particularly by every one of those writers who have been referred to by the counsel on both sides, that he who conspires to depose the king, compasses and imagines the death of the king; and it never has been made a question, whether the compassing and imagining the death of the king was the primary intent conceived in the mind, and was prior to the conspiracy to depose him, or whether the conspiracy to depose the king, must necessaily, from the nature of the charge, be subsea to the compassing and imagining the eath of the king; I say it isnot to be put to you that the compassing and imagining the death of the king is to be proved a conception in the mind, prior to the conception of deposing the king. The conspiracy to depose the king is evidence of compassing and imagining the death of the king, conclusive in its Nature, so conclusive that it is beconte a presumption of law, which is in truth nothing more than a necessary and violent presumption of fact, admitting of no contradiction. Who can doubt that the natural person of the king is immediately attacked and attempted by him who attempts to depose him. 
EYRE 12478 Gentlemen, I shall employ no more time in discussing such a question; many, many hours were spent at the bar, in this discussion; but, on the part of the prisoner, it was manifest, that, after the discussion, the argument broke down under the case, and it became impossible. for either of the gentlemen to set himself distinctly to maintain this proposition, that an honest man could fairly doubt whether he who conspires to depose the king, has compassed or imagined his death. 
EYRE 12479 Gentlemen, you will therefore proceed to the examination of the fact, and I am most cordially disposed to agree with the counsel for the prisoner, that, if he is this day to be convicted, he ought to be proveablement attaint; i e. the proof ought to be clear and convincing. I avoid using the word direct, lest I should entangle you in a difficulty, as to the nature of the proof; it may consist of a train of circumstances, provided the result is such as shall leave no doubt in your minds. The law of the land is perfectly clear, that such proof is as legal, and therefore ought to be as satisfactory, as the most positive and direct proof that can be offered 
EYRE 12480 Gentlemen, the question of fact may be shortly stated thus : Whether the prisoner, and the other persons, have conspired to subvert the monarchy, and whether they have set on foot a project of a convention of the people, in order to effect it? 
EYRE 12481 Gentlemen, I have employed a part of that time since the Court broke up, which it was necessary enough for me to have devoted to sleep, in endeavouring to take such a review of the evidence in this cause, as might enable me to lay the questions of fact between the king, and the prisoner at the bar, with some tolerable distinctness, before you, that you might see where the matter hinged, and that you might be the better enabled to apply your attention and consideration to the different points of the case. I do not know whether I shall succeed, or not, but I do hope I shall be able tw point out to you the leading features of this case, in a way that may be of some use to you in forming your judgment. 
EYRE 12482 I begin with stating to you, that I think it ought to be conceded to this prisoner, upon the whole result of this evidence, that he had set out originally upon that which is called the Duke of Richmond's Plan of a Reform in Parliament; that is, upon a plan to obtaina representation of the people in the Commons House of Parliament, by Universal Suftrag and Annual Election; and I think it will incumbent on those who sustain the prose cution, to satisfy you that the prisoner, and the other persons who have been concerned with him, whether irritated by their own enthusiasm, or by the example of France, have departed trom that plan, and have entered into a criminal pursuit of another object, another object, in the opinion of very wise men, not very far removed from that which was originally their object (and it is that proximity which has made a laboured promulgation of this doctrine of universal suffrage and annual election, so dangerous to the community); the objectImean to point out to you, is, the substituting, in the room of an improvement of the representation in the Commons House of Parliament, the establishment of a government by a representation of the people only 3.a pure democracy, which may undoubtedly be comprehended under the Lords, “ a fulland free Representation of the People. 
EYRE 12483 Gentlemen, in the mass of the written evidence which has been laid before you, there are to be found passages, and those not extremely numerous, which will be fit to be submitted to your consideration, as grounds from whence the prosecutors have drawn their conclusion, and by which they are to support it; that this departure from the original plan has taken place, and that the prisoner at the bar has entered into the criminal pursuit imputed to him; the passages in the evidence to which I particularly refer you, are those, in the first place, which mark the conduct of the popular societies, in which the prisoner is implicated, in the course of the year 1792, prior to their presenting their addresses to the National Convention of France: when you have considered this evidence, you will have then to consider those addresses to the National Convention, with the circumstances belonging to them. After you have seen and considered those addresses, you will then have to look at their subsequent conduct, to be collected from their written transactions, down to the time of the dispersion of the British Convention, in Scotland, in the latter end of the year 1793; and then you will have to consider, and to form your judgment upon that project of a Convention, which was tonceived and proceeded upon, to a certain extent, in the beginning of 1794. 
EYRE 12484 Gentlemen, here I think you will find the great outline of the charge, upon which, with such explanations as the rest of the written evidence will afford, and the additional circumstances disclosed by the parol testimony, you are to decide. 
EYRE 12485 I think I may state to you, without troubling you with particular evidence, that it is lear, from the whole mass of the evidence which you have heard, that these popular societies had, in the beginning of the year 1792, 80 conducted ihemeclres as to raise a question upon themselves, and their conduct, some time before the addresses to the National Convention took place; you will recollect that it appeared, from some of the papers which were read, that there was a society, calling themselves, he Friends of the People, consisting of men of rank and property, and of distinctior in the country, who had refused to correspond with the Constitutional Society, You will recullect, that the same set of men had exhorted the Sheffield Society, with whom they were in correspondence that year, and had exhorted them in vain, to make an exPlicit declaration of their attachment to the vernment, as by law established. Some of these popular societies had gone so far, that a society, at Stockport, put the question, di‘rectly, to the London Corresponding Society, by a letter, addressed to the precner ow at the bar, to know what it was they meant, and particularly to know, whether Meant to go on with the House of Lords? That society intimated their doubts, whether, with the House of Lords, they could effectuate ther plan of reform; or, whether with the arpa who made a part of the House of liberty of conscience, as they understood it, could ever be sacetacinny established. 
EYRE 12486 Another society, in the same year, from Norwich, put the question still more distinctly, and in a way which could not possibly be misunderstood ; for they put this direct question to the prisoner, Hardy, as secretary to the London Corresponding Society : Do you mtend to rip up the monarchy by the roots? It is in evidence, they suspected that this hs letter was a snare, intended for them; will recollect Lynam’s evidence to that and that they were on their guard. The prsoner, Hardy, for the society, answered both these letters. To be sure, one might reason ably have expected that men, who adopted the duke of Richmond’s plan, with sincerity of heart, and who meant not to go beyond his plan, would, when called upon, have most distinctly avowed the extent of their plan, m terms which could admit of no equivocatioz, or exception; that they would have avowed their dutiful attachment to the king; that they would have avowed their adherence te the constitution of the Fovemment, as by law established, in King, Lords, and Commons; that they would have left no man to doubt, and particularly those persons who put the question to them, what their opinion was upon these points, on which their opin was to govern the conduct of others. With respect to the-present letter, the move reasoa they had to suspect that letter to be a snare, laid for them, the more reason they had te speak out. 
EYRE 12487 What the opinion was that they really entertained, the answers to these two requisitions are supposed to be sufficient to enable you to discover; the letters and the answers shall now be read to you; before they are read, I would observe, once for all, that ma case of this nature, much stress t net to be laid on particular expressions. forbid that men’s lives should depend on nice inter pretations and constructions of words. I am against even a very strict interpretation of actions, to the prejudice of any prisoner; but sometimes expressions are too strong, sometimes transactions too explicit, to admit of a doubt as to their real interpretation meaning. 
EYRE 12488 Gentlemen, hear the answers to these two reinors sead 3 attend to foo a and se what it is they do import, ticularly whether they do import any satisinctony sal explicit avowal of attachment to the constitation of the country, as by nwcsyabliahed, King, Lords, aml Chcaesten, ‘ 
EYRE 12489 Cae ee A 
EYRE 12490 Gentlemen, all the observations that are to be made on the particular expressions in these two answers, have been already made to you by the counsel, and you will judge of their roper force. I have no occasion to repeat tan, Such of them as strike your minds, clearly and distinctly, are probably well founded. If it requires much niceness of critical inguiry to fix the meaning imputed to the words, I should advise you not to emplo: yourselves in that sort of criticism. I thin you would only entangle yourselves, and you would not see the case in its great outlines, which I believe is the only way in which it can be seen truly. One observation only I shall make on their answer, because it is immediately connected with the history of this transaction, namely, that, in their answer they inform the society at Stockport, that they have resolved on addressing the French National Convention, and then follows this extraordinary passage: ‘“ Without entering into the probable effects of such a measure, effects which your society will not fail to discover, we invite you to join us. What were to be the probable effects of this measure, which these persons were to discover? And why did not oy epaealy avow to this society the whole of their project, in terms that could admit of no yosaile equivocation, or doubt? These are Le only observations which I make on this tter. 
EYRE 12491 Gentlemen, they state that they had resolved to address the National Convention, and they did, in fact, address it; and it is very apparent in the evidence, that the society to which Hardy belonged took the lead in that measure. ‘They notify it not only to the Stockport Society, but also to the other societiea, with whom they were then in correspondence. They transmitted their resolution to address the Convention to the Society for ConStitutional Information; that society having declared their approbation of the intention, the London Corresponding Society transmitted to them the address, which they meant to send; the result was, that the Society for Constitutional Information did not think fit to join them ia that particular address, but they also resolved to present an address of their own to the Convention of France, and they, in fact, did so. What their objects were in presenting these addresses, are only darkly alluded to in the letter of the Corresponding jiety to the Society at Stockport; but whatever their objects might be, itis an observation which arises upon their conduct to-t J act, there- was little to be doue here, with wards those two societies to whom they sent these two letters, and upon their conduct in thus presenting these addresses, that if, in order to account for, and to explain the letters, iv could suppose that they had measures to p with those societies, the violence of some to check, the moderation of others to animate, for them to keep measures with those societies, and to answer every man in his own way, so‘as to lose none, and to increase the number of their followers ; and if you were disposed, therefore, to attribute the particular language of these answers to some such necessity, or policy, yet in respect of their conduct to the National Convention of France, they appear to be perfectly volunteers; to have no measures to keep with any body, and to be therefore directly responsible for all the consequences that might follow from such addresses. ‘ 
EYRE 12492 Gentlemen, it will be necessary to trouble you with the reading of these addresses; 
EYRE 12493 ause they, on the part of the prosecution, insist, that they admit of no explanation whatever; that they are the measures of determined Republicans, going out of their way to express their zeal in the cause of Republicanism
EYRE 12495 Such was the language of these addresses, which were presented to the National Convery a France. ; ee entlemen, it appears from the evidence, that these addresses were presented by pers sons appointed from hence. The name of one of them is J. Frost. The language in which Frost presented them, you are in possession of; it has been laid before you, in the course of the evidence, but it may be proper that you should now hear it read again. 
EYRE 12496 I forbear, at this time, to remark on the conduct of the persons employed to present these addresses, except so far as that conduct is connected with the case of the prisoner at the bar, because, in any other view of it, it is not before you. The language used by Frost is connected with the case of the prisoner; for though not held by the prisoner himself, nor by the persons who deputed Frost to deliver the addresses, yet it is brought home to them, because the language of the presentation of the address is transmitted by Frost to the societies; and you will find, that, after they had been informed in what language it had been presented, an unqualified approbation of the conduct of Frost was given by the Society for Constitutional Information, of which Hardy was an associated member. 
EYRE 12497 An observation has been made upon one of these addresses, which declares, that till the National Convention of France had begun to respect to the views of these popular societies, What connexion the views of these popular societies could have with the National Convention of France, unless they had begun to entertain a new idea, or a new interpretation of the phrase, “ Representation of the people or any other objects, which made it necessaryby Universal Suffrage and Apnual Electons, arising out of the proceedings of the National Convention of France, or it not arising out of them, yet to be now adopted, in consequence of the National Convention of France having exhibited that great scene on the theatre of the world, and to be now attempted to be carried into execution, is for your judgment. The presenter of these addresses has expressed an expectation, that felicitations might soon come over to a National Assembly here. What that National Assembly was to be, which was to be established here in Fugland, and which was to be felicitated by France, will be a subject for your serious consideration, and must deserve and demand the deepest investigation. 
EYRE 12498 Gentlemen, I have stated to you, that the only effect, in this case, which the language of the delegate, who presented this address, can have, is in respect of the adoption of it by the prisoner, and by the persons concerned with him. It was truly observed, that, if an agent be employed, it would be cruel to bind his principal to any thing in which he went beyond the bounds of his agency. It would be cruel to impute the acts of an agent to his Principal, when that principal never approved of them ; but, if the principal does approve of them, there is no hardship in such imputation; there is no cruelly or hardship whatever in niaking the principal accountable for the conduct of the agent, in construing the language of the agent to be the language of the principal. 
EYRE 12499 Gentlemen, you will judge, whether those concerned to support this prosecution have, upon solid grounds, or otherwise, branded these proceedings with rank Republicanism, and with being a distinct avowal, that every one of those people was embarked in the cause of Republicanism: it is an extremely important point to settle; for, on your review of the subsequent transactions in this cause, they will undoubtedly have, and must have a very different complexion, as they are understood to be the proceedings of determined republicans, or as they are understood to be the Proceedings of dutiful and loyal subjects to the king, zealously affected to the constitution of the country, as established in a King, Lords, and Commons. Men of the one description are entitled to a large, liberal, and candid interpretation of all their words and actions. Men of those other principles must expect to have their language, sentiments, and conduct referred to those principles. 
EYRE 12500 Gentlemen, the next head of inquiry for you will be, the transactions of these societies, subsequent to the presenting of those addresses, and prior to the conception of the resent design of a National Convention in ngland, which is the immediate subject of this prosecution; and you will examine, whether the persons who had taken this extraordinary stepiwtuch seems to have been uncalled for, and to have for its principal object a public demonstration, that thus addressed the National Convention. were actuated by the same principle of &mocracy which governed the Convention.) ;1 say, whether the authors of it, and the perscas concerned in it, have in any manner redeemed themselves, by their subsequent conduc, from the imputation which the presenting these addresses has brought upon them. I stated to you, that, as far as voting an unqulitied approbation goes, they immediately adopted the comment upon their own condut, by their own agent, that probably a felicitation would come from France to a Natenal Assembly in England. There is nehng done by these societies to discourage the epectation of a National Convention in Ene. land; you will judge whether they have net taken very active steps to prepare the way for it. The acts of these societies, more im mediately referable to this subject, which have been laid before you, on the part of the prosecution, consist chiefly of resolutions, mporting warm and unqualified approbation of the works of two celebrated writers, Thomzs Paine and Joel Barlow ; the first writing ‘Ipoa the Rights of Man, and the last on what was called the Privileged Orders, Parts of these works have been read to you, and they area most direct attack on the establishmentot the monarchy of this country ; and they doatlck more or less pointedly and directly the establishment of that order in this country—the House of Lords. The societies not only approved of these works, but they dispervd them all over the country, with a wondcrul anxiety, and ata great expense. The proscutors, in this case, have asked the question, why was this done? They say it is acting consistently, if it is done by Republicans, who wish to subvert the monarchy, and overturn the established orders; but, if it 8 done by dutiful subjects of the king, and persons attached to the constitution of the cum try, what explanation can they give of it? In the defence that was made for the prisoner, it was observed, that there were parts of these works that went only, in general, to defend the Rights of Man in society, without gory to the establishments of this country; that to such parts of these works, there could be no reasonable objection ; and that those parts might, therefore, be disseminated by honest men and good subjects. Admit that the observation is fair; was it not the duty of honest men, and good subjects, who were dis seminating such parts of these works as mizht serve to enlighten mankind, on subjects 00 which they ought to be enlightened, to bare taken some pains to have separated the bad parts from the good, or at least to have ziven the public some caution, that, in reading those works, they should make a separation of themselves, that when they were read of the general Rights of Man, and fcam passages striking at the monarchy of thts country, they should be careful! not to imbibe persons whoprejudices against the monarchy? ‘That whes reading observations on Privileged Orders, they should take care to remember, this was not intended to strike at the orders of this country, to which the public had a devoted attachment? 
EYRE 12501 Such, gentlemen, would have been the conduct of good subjects, That this was not the conduct of these persons is most apparent; and that these publications must have had the eftect of doing a great deal of mischief, by alienating the minds of the king’s subjects from his person and government, and trom the constitution, is perfectly clear. How much of this effect these persons intended, I shall leave entirely fur your consideration ; thus much I think is clear, that there is nothing in those publications which can serve to remove any prejudices which arise against the prisoner, and the persons concerned with him, irom the addresses which was presented to the Convention of France. 
EYRE 12502 Gentlemen, another general feature in the transactions of those men, at this peried, is their numerous publications, complaining of grievances supposed to exist in this country, and the abundance of licentious observations scattered throughout these publications, all tending to produce the same effect—the alienation of the affections of the country from the king and government. Grievances may and will exist in all governments, and that they may exist in a greater or less degree, in this government, may be true; but dutiful and good subjects, who honestly mean the reform of these grievances, will take care, in their endeavours to procure this reform, not to hazard the overturning the government itself. 
EYRE 12503 These are the transactions in the early part of the year 1793, upon which the prosecutors rely, as manifesting a spirit of disaffection and republicanism by which these men were actuated, and as evidence of their having taken measures to prepare men’s minds for what they call a radical reform; in effect, a change in the whole government of the country. 
EYRE 12504 It appears, that in the course of the summer of that year the project of a National Convention, to be held in Scotland, originated ; and they say, on the part of the prosecntion, and certainly not without colour (how far it is distinctly proved you will judge), that it originated with the prisoner at the bar. They refer you to a letter, written by the priSoner to Skirving in Edinburgh. 
EYRE 12505 Now you will hear the answer read which Skirving sent to that letter, and you will aftend to it, because that answer is charged on the part of the prosecution to have a great deal of matter in it, tending to explain the mechanism of a National Convention, and also what was to be its great object. 
EYRE 12506 Gentlemen, every part of this letter deserves the most serious attention, in that view of it, which I pointed out to you just before the reading of the letter. I think there are some paragraphs in it which may require to be restated to you. ‘This letter says,—‘ 1 have not ahigher wish in the present exertions for reform, than to see the people universally and regularly associated; because I am persuaded that the present disastrous engagemenis will issue in ruin, and the people then must provide for themselves. What do these mysterious words mean 
EYRE 12508 “ And it would be unhappy (says the writer of this letter) when we should be ready to act with unanimity, to be occupied about organization, without which, however, anarchy must ensue. Orgauization of what? It is true, that if the country was to be brought to such a state, that the government was to be destroyed and another form of government to take its lace, it would be unhappy when we shouldready to act with unanimity to be occupied about organization of the new powers of government, without which anarchy must ensue
EYRE 12510 The extent of reform which they ought to seek, according to the defence was distinct, and well known, and had been so a great while, for it was the duke of Richmond’s plan of reform, 
EYRE 12511 He adds—“ Be prepared to justify it, and to controvert objections ; let us model the whole in the public mind; let us provide every stake and stay of the tabernacle which we would erect : so that when the tabernacles of oppression, in the palaces of ambition, are broken down, under the madness and folly of their supporters, we may then, without anarchy and all dangerous delay, erect at once our tabernacle of righteousness, and may the Lord himself be in it. 
EYRE 12512 What docs this mysterious man mean? What is this tabernacle of rightcousness to be erected at once, without anarchy and dangerous delay? are they right on the part of the prosecution when they say, that he means that it is probable there may soon be a revolution in the government of this country, and that, in that case, it would be fit some body of men should be ready to take upon themselves the powers of government, and to act upon them P or does he only mean that a reform in parliament would be found to be necessary; that people ought to know what it is they mean to ask, and in what manner they mean to ask it. 
EYRE 12513 Gentlemen, this is an exposition of this doctrine of a Convention coming from a Briton, and immediately communicated to the prisoner at the bar; and, rin that respect, has a direct application to him; and it is of importance, as it tends to satisfy you that he has not been surprised into any thing, but that having had this communication with Skirving on the subject, he had an opportunity of weighing it. 
EYRE 12514 There is in the evidence another exposition of a national convention, it may be pro that I should mention it, but I shall not state it with great particularity, because, under the circumstances of this case, I do not think it ought to press much against the prisoner
EYRE 12516 [sre spect to the letter that was sent to himself; he had a full opportunity of weighing it; of asking for explanation; or of correcting the ideas that were in it: and it gave him warning to take care that if such a convention was sct op foot, it might not lead to the consequences which seem to be pointed out in that letter. Gentlemen, on the fifth of October of that year the prisoner wrote a letter to Skirving, in answer to a letter of Skirving’s dated October the second; which last letter is not in evi dence. In this letter the prisoner mentiuns his having communicated to Margarot cay, Skirving’s project of a convention in Scotland; he recommends it to Skirving to write an official letter to his (Hardy’s) society, propose to them to send delegates to that convention; and, in that letter, he desires Skirving vot to take notice that he had any com Tounication with him. Here the prisoner, Hardy, appears quite in a new character. He was certainly not an inactive member of the society, independent of his being secretary to the society. Had he acted only as secretary, it might be said, he might have been misled in a great many things; he might have written many things which he did not understand, or which he had not time to weigh, as a man might write whole sheets without having any idea of the sense after he had written them: it was, therefore, very much in his favour to consider the prisoner only as a secretary. But here he certainly is a principal, and most extraordinarily so; a princi i with a great share of the spirit of intrigue and duplicity, which totally changes the character of the man, as it might have been collected from all the rest of the evidence in the cause. A letter is written accordingly by Skirving, and the delegates are appointed; they were two very able men, viz. Margarot and Gerrald. The Scottish Convention is held. They sat for fourteen days, and were then dispersed ty authority. What would have happened it that Scottish Convention had not dispersed, one can only conjecture ; but in order to form any rational conjecture, it is to attend to the general conduct of that convention. It is fit you should call back to ycur memory just the leading features of it. It is pressed on you, on behalf of the prisoner, that the meeting of the delegates of these bodies was for this single object—to consider what was the best way of appealing to parliament, in order to procure a returm in the Commons House of Parliament. As to that, you will recollect the transactions of that year respecting an application to parliament. There had been an application to parliament, and the principal mover was Mr. Grey. Of the sincerity of the honourable mover, in his application for a parliamentary reform, I suppose no man will doubt; but of the sincerity of the application of these popular societies to par liament, on the evidence before you, every man must doubt. They express themselves, upon more than one occasion, as disposed to consent to it only because it would prepare men for what was to follow, and serve to keep the public mind in agitation upon that subject. Considering this convention as assembled, in order to procure a reform in parliament, it would be fit to compare the means with the end, and then judge whether this ostensible purpose was the only purpose of this convention. 
EYRE 12517 When there was a motion made, that a scroll ofa petition to parliament should be prepared, they negatived it, and therefore, if that was their only object, the aed of their meeting was atan end; but, laying that object aside, view this conventionas it was ; yon find it closely imitating the manners of the National Convention of France; you hear of primary assemblies and sections; you perceive this National Convention assuming. to itself a formality of proceeding which is very becoming where it is subject to no just exception, but in the place in which it appears, cerinly very alarming. We findthe convention is constituted every day by solemn prayer ; it is closed every day by solemn praver. They had their committee of finances ; their patriotic donations, with honourable mention; their order of the day; their appellation of citizen ; and the tenth day they assumed this date, The first year of the British Convention : recollect, how all this follows the poe, of the National Convention of France. Who shall say what would have happened if that convention had not been dispersed at the end of fourteen days? Whoshall say that if they continued to assume in the manner in which they had begun, and some interval had been Pracied to them, and that in that time they had happened to gain the public opinion in their favour, judging by what happened in France, who shall say that this body of men would not have been the government of this country? This convention was, however, dispersed; the consequence of which has been, that legal proceedings have taken place against some of the members, upon which it would mot become me in this place to make any observations, except that occasion has been taken to complain of these proceedings as a grievance, and most certainly the prisoner, and those who are connected with him in these societies, did take occasion from thence to irritate the public mind to as great a degree as it was possible to do, by the reflections that were made on these proceedings. 
EYRE 12518 Gentlemen, there immediately followed upon the reflections which were dispersed on the subject ofthese proceedings, the plan of a British Convention to be held in England ; which leads us to the pointto which the whole of the present inquiry is to have its relation, mmore or less. Now it deserves serious attention on your parts to the circumstances with which this new plan of a convention was introduced to the public notice, and by which it was recommended to the public attention ; in order to enable you to Tue, whether the object of it was that peaceable ebject which is insisted on for the prisoner; whether a reform in the Commons House of Parliament wasreally the bottom of the whole; or whether the object of it must have been to alter the constitution of our government, to obtain indeed a full and perfect representation of the prople, but not in the Commons House of 
EYRE 12519 ‘arliament. 
EYRE 12520 One should have apprehended that under any provocation which these people professed to have felt, or which they might really feel, they would have pursued a very different course from that which they did pursue, as they were acquainted with the circumstances of the dispersion of the former convention, and with all the objections that were made to that convention. As they were determined to have another convention, it was to be expected that, at least, they would have taken care so to their language and proceedings, that it should be impossible they could be misunderstood ; to have expressed themselves clearly and distinctly on all occasions; to have explained the grounds of this convention; to have conducted themselves with a decent moderatiun towards the government of the country, and towards its proceedings, It might reasonably have been expected that they would have made an express avowal of loyal sentiments, and an express disavowal of going any lengths which could be justly objected to; an express disavowal of oing beyond the original object of pe amentary reform, as stated by the duke of Richmond. Every thing that was inflammatory ought-to have been most carefully avoided, in order to prevent their purpose being misunderstood; and what was more material, in order to ensure success to the measure itself. What was done you will see, and from that you will form your own conclusions. They published a paper, which you will hear rent. and you will attend to it. I do not consider it as my business to make particular comments on it, let it make its own impression on your minds. The paper I refer to (there are many which are connected with it) is the address of the 20th of January, 1794, of the London Corresponding Society, at a genera] meeting held at the Globe-tavern. 
EYRE 12521 Gentlemen, you have heard this paper read, it expressly refers to a convention; and it was certainly published ata time when an idea of a convention was in the minds of the people. Now you are to judge between the king and the prisoner upon the evidence which this paper affords, whether the object of that convention was merely to procure a free and full representation of the people in the Commons House of Parliament, and in the due course of law, and according to the constitution of the country, or whether that paper is to be understood as a manifesto to excite the people to overturn the government, and to direct the people's minds to the use that should be made of a convention for the purpose of overturning the government1. 
EYRE 12522 Gentlemen, this happened on the 20th of January, 1794; soon afterwards they began in these two societies to consider how this convention was to be brought about. The London Correspunding Society had come to a resolution upon it in terms which upon the face of it were open to some observations. A communication took place between the Corresponding Society and the Society for ConStitutional Infermation. The two societies appointed a joint committee, who came to a resolution expressed in more guarded language, which you will hear read. 
EYRE 12523 You see that this is a dry resolution to call a convention for the purpose of taking into consideration the proper method of obtaining a fair and full representation of the people. This is their object, as they think fit to express themselves upon consideration; and it ¢ertainly was not too late for them to have retracted any part of the rashness and violence of any former measure which they might have taken. If they, thinking they had been too violent in their expressions, or extravagant in their sentiments had come to this resvlution, with a view to remedy the fault of their former proceedings, and confine the objects of the convention within its just limits, that consideration would, no doubt, have its due weight; but even in this resolution we find nodeclaration that they sought only a refurm in the Commons House of Parliament, and that no attempt was meant against the King, and the jurisdiction and authority of the House of Lords.There was a joint committee of correspondence and co-operation appointed by these societies to consider of the means for carrying this resolution into execution, and it appears that they entered into a very extensive correspondence both in England and in Scotland for that purpose ; while that correspondence was going on, upon the 14th of April last, the London Corresponding Society held a general meeting ; it seems to have been originally intended to have been held in a large room in Store-street ; it was not held there probably from an apprehension that the magistrates might interfere, and therefore they adjourned to a place inthe neighbourhood of London, Chalk-farm, They there assembled to the number of two thousand or more, and there the resolutions, which will be read to you presently, were voted. These resolutions are as violent, or more so, than the former, and do not in the least correspond with the idea of applying to obtain a reform of parliament on the duke of Richmond’s plan, but seem rather calculated to prepare the minds of the people for a violent crisis, acrisis upon which a National Convention once assembled would immediately act, and in the nature of things would be called upon to act; this is the prosecutor’s construction of these resolutions. You will attend to them, and see whether tua is the proper construction to be. put upoa them—why they assembled that mecting at all is extremely difficult to comprehend. If they thought the former resolutions had gone too far, and would have been liable to creat misconstruction, and possibly might do a great deal of mischief, it might be necessary to call another meeting for the purpose of correcting what was extravagant in these resolutions, and of bringing back things toa more moderate tone ; to point out more disunctly the lawful objects they had in view, and wtally to exclude all idea of their going beyond those objects. Tobe sure such a meeting, in their circumstances, might have been vers proper ; but if it should appear that this second meeting was pursuing the same idea, and giving a great deal of countenance to what was done at the former meeting, that the as sembling of two thousand people must bave an effect to impress the public mind, that a force was ready to act when called upon, and they were determined to go on with that, which on the 20th of January they had promulgated to the world, If instead of intending to bring things back, or to remedy the effects of their foriner violence, we tind them advancing in the same carecr, and hastemag by the same means to the accomplishasx at ot their object, what must be the conclusiun? If instead of coming forward with a declaration of their loyalty to the throne, or their attacbment to the constitution of parliament, as far as respects the House of Lords, in order to do away the impression of their former proceedings, and remove all suspicion and ambiguity with respect to their future intentions, we find them coming forward with another minitesto; this manifesto comes forward in a still more questionable shape than the former, as it carnies along with it the appearance of great force, and may be understood to notfy that they are ready, if it shall be necessary, to sct in support of their former resolutions. You will fr these resolutions of Chalk-farm read, and you will form your own judgment on them. 
EYRE 12524 Gentlemen, one cannot hear this paper read, without feeling astonishment that men could be so blinded by enthusiasm, or by any other affection of the human mind, as not to see that in consequence of such a publication ag this, independent of its particular applica tion lo the subject of our present inquiry, the sword of the law was hanging over their heads by a single thread. They ap; to have linaeticd that the meeting of a conventwa could not be prevented but by act of parla ment. Suppose it was possible for them have believed that, and suppose the publicity of their proceedings to afford some argument that these men thought them legal, was possible, if they attended to the subject, or if they had taken any advice, not to see that it was extremely criminal to publish those resolutions to two hundred thousand people? and as many more as might have an opportunity of looking atthem. According to these resoJutions, it was a probable case “ that they would soon be in a state where the social compact would be actually dissolved, and that it-would be necessary to appeal to that principle, that incontrovertible maxim of eternal justice, that the safety of the people was the supreme, and in cases of necessity, the only law, which admits but of one interpretation. If the social compact is dissolved, there is an end of the government, of course there must be the establishment of another in its stead ; another government must be framed ; this is therefore expressly encouraging the people to look out for the moment to arrive when another government was to be framed, to be erected on the ruins of the present establishment. 
EYRE 12525 Gentlemen, it is of importance, with respect to the present question, that the eighth and tenth resolutions glance, not in an indirect manner, at the House of Lords, as a body in the contitution, not entitled to the respect of the people. Of what extreme consequence this was in the present moment you will see, because this was the moment in which, that which was to be done in the National Convention, was to occupy the minds of all people. And what was to 4 done? They say on the part of the prisoner, that he, and those who were associated with him, were in a dutiful, constitutional, and regular course, to collect sense of all people, and then present the united wishes of the peuple, in a regular and constitutional way, to parliament. Now was that, or could that be the object of men who had assumed so much of the republican character, who afler addressing the National Convention of France, had acted the part they done, up to the present moment, who were then talking of the social compact being dissolved, and were then speaking contemptuously of the other branch of the legislature. 
EYRE 12526 To this question, what was meant to be done in this convention, as resolved on, in January, 1792,and as followed up by the resolutions at Chalk-farm, on the 14th of April, belongs a transaction of a society at Sheffield, which has been a leading society in correspondence with the two societies here in London. ‘The society at Sheffield, had been artificially represented to be extremely numerous; there was a meeting, in fact, of ten thousand, on the 7th of April, on the Castle-hill, Several resolutions were there passed ; they were moved by a Mr. Yorke, not a native of that place, but who found his way among them, and made use of that opportunity. You have heard of Mr. Yorke being a member of the London Corresponding Society—under what directions he went to Sheffield, does not appear; how these resolutions were obtained, I 
EYRE 12527 do not think it material to observe upon, farther than that it isa satisfaction to know; that though multitudes are made parties to these proceedings, there is every reason in the world to belive, that but few are engaged in the depth of the project. Of the ‘ten thousand people assembled on the Castle-hill, there is no reason to suppose that two hundred knew what was going forward. A trick for negativing a resolution to petition parliament, was concerted between four people, and by their mancuvring, and management, these resolutions passed in such a way, that it was impos. sible they could be understood by the greatest part of the people; but however that was, the promulgation of them to the world at this juncture, appears tu have avery close connexion with this plan of aconvention. It was Proposed, and resolved, to petition parliament no more. It was observed by. the counsel for the prisoner, that oe cannot justly conclude, because an individual society, or those who conducted that society were of opinion that they should petition parliament no more, that therefore a body of men, more likely to command the attention of parliament, were not, according to their apprehension to apply to parliament, fora parliamentary reform. 
EYRE 12528 It was fairly put, and it is right and fit to see whether the observation is founded in the truth of the case. When you come to examine the resolution with the context, it hardly admits of that interpretation, because the reason they assign for not petitioning is, that they will not petition a body who are not their representatives. Now that reason must apply to the House of Commons for ever, accordin, to their notion of it, and as it was underst and adopted, by the Corresponding Society, and other societies with whom they were in correspondence. If it could not be the object of this convention to petition parliament, where shall we find the pie. but in the addresses to the nation immediately preceding and immediately following the promulgation of the project, which appear totally inconsistent with the idea of a convention for the purpose of an application to parliament, and to be consistent with, and calculated to give effect to aconvention for other purposes, and particularly for the purpose of concerting the means of establishing a representative government of the people
EYRE 12530 The parol evidenceapplies both ways, many of the witnesses for the crown expressly disavow all force upon the government, and every other object beyond a reform in the ommons House of Parliament; on the other hand, individuals are charged with having attempted to corrunt the soldiery, and to have meditated a personal attack upon the king, and direct force against his government ; but this, however, I ought to observe, is not brought home to the prisoner. There is also parol evidence, though loose and unconmected, of a preparation of arms in which the prisoner is in some degree implicated. One witness, not of the best credit, said that they were to furnish themselves with arms to defend the National Convention when it should be called. This evidence in its nature is very important—this is clear, that in their idea of a national convention, every thing was therein to be conducted peaceably, and orderly, the national convention must then be protected from without, because it is by such a national convention being protected, and being left at liberty to act, that it could exeeute its orders and decrees; it seems, therefore, not imconsistent with the idea of a national convention which was to overturn the government, to inculcate peace, and good order; for the truth undoubtedly was, and these persons saw it, that whatever this national convention was to do, it must do by means of having the voice of the public going along with it. It was in that way only, that it could execute its purposes; the taking arms, therefore, to defend the national convention, has an immediate connexion with the charge. In the parol evidence it was also stated, that these people expected there would be a struggle before they obtained their object, and that they had made a preparation for it; several witnesses said, that their whole object, in furnishing themselves with arms was, to defend themselves against illegal attacks, and negatively, that they did not mean to attack the king, or the government. If they had no object Bavond pure self-defence, they might lawfully furnish themselves with arms. 
EYRE 12531 If they meant to put themselves into a condition to sustain their convention by force, against any attack which might be made upon it, or upon them in defence of it, «defence becomes offence and treason. 
EYRE 12532 Respecting the whole of this evidence as to arms, standing alone, I should have thought No great reliance was to be had upon it; connected, as it is, with the whole transactions of these bodies, it certainly is evidence very fit to be taken into consideration by the jury, and is of some use towarcs marking what was in the minds of the people at the time theylished in the name of the duke of Richmond— 
EYRE 12533 Proposed this conven'ion, and whether their purpose was that which this prosecution charges—a purpose of subverting the govern-ment of the country, consequently deposingcerned in this particular measure of a conventhe king, which is an overt ‘act of compatsmp the king’s death. 
EYRE 12534 Gentlemen, I have extracted from the evidence such parts of it, as appear to me matetially to bear upon the charge, in order that you may be able to take a distinct view of it, and to judge for yourselves, whether or not they justify the charge to the extent in which it is laid. 
EYRE 12535 But, before you come to that consideration, you are to attend, and to attend with favour, to every thing that can be urged on the part of A prisoner. " oe entlemen, on the part le prisoner, he part of the written Tiience has been cxtroverted: it-could not well be controverted, I do not think it has been very weightily urged that the prisoner did not take such an active share in these transactions, as te make ban, not only in strictness of law, a principal, bat, to the satisfaction of every man’s mind, 3 Principal in the whole of them. He was net only secretary to one of these societies, but a member of both, and an active member, and, in one or two instances, si ly active. He was the promoter, designer, and inventor of some of the measures, with some degree of mancuvring and management; and there fore I did not think it necessary to trouble you with separately stating the particular evidence which affects him. 
EYRE 12536 Gentlemen, they have made several fair and weighty observations on the credit and materiality of the parol testimony, in respect of the situation of the witnesses, many of them introducing themselves into these societies, for the purpose of erring saturation af what was passing there, antl also in respect of the subject matter of the testimony itvelf, particularly that of arming, as having so necessary connexion with this plan of a convention, which had been projected; sad I think there is a great deal of weight in thet observation; and if it depended entirely upon the circumstance of the arms, to manifest the purpose of a convention, I should stste to you, that, though it was a case of pret suspicion, yet that it hardly went to t! to fix on the convention a wicked purpose of that extraordinary extent which the prosecation has imputed to it, upon all the grounds of evidence, taken together, which the case furnishes. 
EYRE 12537 Gentlemen, they state the case of the prisoner thus : That he isa plain man, of simplicity of manners, peaceable and orderly in his deportment, and a friend to the constitution of his country; having one great political object in his mind, namely, the obtaining a radical reform in the Commoss House oF Parliament, by the introduction of universal suffrage and annual elections—Thet he had taken this object from a plan pub
EYRE 12538 They say, this has been the sole object ofall his measures ; and that, as faras he has been cue tion, his ideas on that subject were taken from that book; and there is certainly a very plain allusion in that book, to the people meeting together for the purpose of considering of the means to execute such parliamentary reform ; that he had an expectation, highly encouraged by the language of that book, that the united sense of a great number of people by their delegates in convention, expressed to parliament, might perhaps have better success than petitions from individuals, whether they were considered as individual men, or as individual societies of men. 
EYRE 12539 They farther insist for the prisoner, that here is to be found no proof of a design to use this convention to any other purpose; and that, as to the horrible purpose of subverting the government, they say, it is not only not proved, but, in the nature of the thing, is improbable, and even impossible, considering how disproportioned the means are to the end—That, if it is to be considered as a pro
EYRE 12540 Convention at Edinburgh, it ought not to be held to be treasonable, because that was treated as a misdemeanor only—They say, whatever violence there may be in the language of the resolutions, addresses, and other papers to which the prisoner has been privy, there is in them no demonstration of the treasonable designs now imputed to him, They appeal to the testimony of a great umber of members of the different societies with whom he has been connected, for the soundness of their principles, and of his own; ! their dutiful attachment to the king, and their reverence for the constitution of parliament, and for the Lord’s House of Parliament, as a branch of it. And the prisoner also appeals to the character given of him by acloud of respectable witnesses, who represent him as a peaceable, sedate, religious and moral man, aving as many of them collect from his conversation, this one object a reform of parliament; and, as a particular manifestation of the conscious ; Annocence of his conduct, they refer you toa proposition which he made to Mr. Sheridan, when that gentleman proposed to bring the proceedings of these societies before parliament, in the spring of the year 1793 : the prisoner offered to show him his books, papers, and, in short, all his correspondence, that had any relation to the subject, and was } 
EYRE 12541 ready to lay them before parliaient
EYRE 12543 T have already given it as my opinion, thag it ought to be conceded to the prisoner, that really, and truly, when he set out in this business, he was sincerely attached to that re form, as expressed in the duke of Richmond’s plan; and probably, at that time, he had no idea of going beyond it; but the question now befure you is, whether he has not gone very far indeed beyond it. 
EYRE 12544 Mr. Solicitor General, in his reply, bas impeached some of the testimony that has been given for the prisoner, by implicating the witnesses belonging to some of these sacieties, in the violent measures which were adopted by these societies, and the Sheffield Socicty in particular, whose duplicity in their correspondence with the Constitutional Society, and the Society of the Friends of the Peuple, of which I have already taken notice, is open to a great deal of observation. Though men declare upon theiroaths that they are peaceable and orderly, and sincerely attached to the constitution of the country, and to their king, yet, if they are found to be en gaged in measures which imply directly the, contrary, it does go very strongly to the credit of their testimony; for, in that case, their testimony is “ Protestatio contra factum. 
EYRE 12545 Gentlemen, in the reply to that part of the evidence given by Mr. Francis, where he said the prisoner appeared to him to be perfectly sincere, it was observed, all this appears hy the evidence to have been mere pretence and pvlicy to carry on the general plan; the reply also observes on the evidence to his character, that though he has established by a cloud of witnesses, and in the most satisfactory manner, that he is in his private character a sedate, moral, religious, good man, yet that his conduct in all these transactions strongly marks, that he is so deeply tinctured with enthusiasm that his moral character may be but a neutral circumstance. The counsel in reply mentioned the famous case, when enthusiasm worked up to the utmostheight produced the fifth Monarchy Men aud that in their case the treason grew out of their religion, 
EYRE 12546 They say on the part of the prosccution, that the acts done by this man, as they appear from all the evidence, are totally inconsistent with the professions he has ‘made and the opinions he says he has entertained, namely, that his real object was only a reform in the Commons House of Parliament. 
EYRE 12547 Gentlemen, upon the whole of this statement of the charge, the defence and reply and upon the whule course of evidence before you, you have now to exercise your judgments. I desire, that in exercising your judgments you will pay no more attention to any thing I have said than that which is necessary to lead you to the consideration of those points which seem immediately to constitute the particular charge against this man, and to the evidence by which it is supponte to those points, and to that evidence y which the defence may be supported, and to the answer given to that defence. Every verdict ought to be the jury’s own and ought to proceed on clear grounds of fact—It ought to do so in a case of this nature more particularly, if possible, because one great object of this prosecution must be that the country ma. that the public justice of it has taken its fair course, and that you, the jury, have well and truly tried and true deliverance made between the gd and the prisoner at the bar, according to the law of the land and the oath which you have taken. 
EYRE 12548 Iam very sorry to have occasion to remark, that during the course of this trial the dignity of a court of justice has but too often been violated by improper behaviour both within and without doors; what it is men can mean by such conduct who do not wish at once to dissolve all government and the bonds of all society, I cannot imagine
EYRE 12552 I suppose there will be no objection to your taking out the indictment; it is not strictly lar, but I dare say it will be consented to on both sides. 
EYRE 12553 Gentlemen, I must apprize you, that after you have withdrawn there can be no refresh ment given to you
EYRE 12563 Gentlemen of the Jury; I ought to take the firstopportunity, after this laborious attendance, very sincerely to thank you for the readiness with which you have sacrificed so much of your personal convenience, and with which you have undergone the fatigue of this trial.

EYRE 12571 Session-House, Clerkenwell—Monday, Oct. 6. 
EYRE 12572 The Court met at ten o’clock, when the grand jury bad not a bill ready to return. About two o’clock the Lord Chief Baron appeared on the bench, when a true bill was returned against the following persons for high treason : 
EYRE 12573 Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke, Jn. Augustus Bonney, 
EYRE 12574 Thomas Holcroft, John Richter, Matthew Moore, 
EYRE 12575 Stewart Kydd, John Thelwall, Jeremiah Joyce, Richard Hodgson, and William Wardle, John Baxter. 
EYRE 12576 The bill against John Lovett was not found. 
EYRE 12577 The jury thanked the chief justice for the charge delivered to them the day on which the commission opened, which, at their reuest, was ordered to be printed. The judge thanked them in return for the compliment. As he would not affect to say that he delivered it without notes, he would chearfully acquiesce in their request. His lordship observed, that the jury had attended four days, and wished to know if they should proceed any farther that day? or if they meant to adjourn? After this conversation, they agreed to adjourn to next day at ten o’clock. 
EYRE 12578 The Attorney General made the usual motions, that copies of the indictments be given to the prisoners. 
EYRE 12579 The Chief Justice wished to know of the attorney general, what time he would be in readiness to deliver to the prisoners the panel of the jury, &c. as ten days were required before the trials could commence. 
EYRE 12580 The Attorney General said, he should be able to answer, and settle the business next lay. The Chief Justice next called upon the persons who attended as agents, solicitors, and others for the prisoners, and informed them, that by the usual application they may have access to the prisoners. He said, he would not harass the prisoners by having them brought up until their arraignment—to inform them of these particulars, for that copies of their indictments should be left with them, and wished this information might be immediately communicated
