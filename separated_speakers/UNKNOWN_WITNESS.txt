UNKNOWN_WITNESS 92 By what means were they to bring together the subjects of the country, to send delegates to such a traitorous convention, to assume such sovereign power? This sort of question may be pursued. I shall not pursue it by observations upon every overt act in this indictment. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 103 The liberty of the press in this country never vught to be under an undue correction of the law, but it must always be, for the sake of the people, subject to the correction of the law: you will find that these publications are either brought into the world with such a secrecy as baffles all prosecution,—published without names of authors or of printers,—published by contrivance, I am sorry to say by contrivance published in the dead of night (though they are the works of men who have talents to state them to open day, if fit to be stated to open day), and published in quantities, which make theapplication of the wholesome provisions of the law utterly incompetent to the purpose of allowing the correction of the law to beas frequent as the commission of the offences against it has been. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 105 It did appear to me that the fublication of the book called the Address to the Addressors was an overt act of high treason, for the purpose of deposing the king; at least I thought it required an ingenuity and subtlety, much beyond that which belonged to was not so; but there were reasons satisfac. tory to those who can judge better than I can and therefore that book was treated only as a libel : but when I come to see it, as connected with the mass of publications alluded to in this indictment,—as connected with measures that I have to state to you in the course of opening this cause,—and as connected with the project which this indictment imputes to depose the king, I say it is either most distinct evidence of an overt act of high peasany or itis an overt act of high treason itself.

UNKNOWN_WITNESS 144 We know, that in 1649 the ruling government in this country was called a parliament, called a Commons Huuse, and it was then enacted, that if any persons should attempt to put a king into this country, they boul be deemed traitors, with much less of an overt act manifested than is necessary st this day. Again, it is stated, “ an heritable crown, or an heritable throne, or by what ever fanciful name such things may be called, have no other significant explanation than that mankind are heritable property. To inherit a government, is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 147 Again, gentlemen, give me leave to observe that this, which has been so often detailed for the worst of purposes, canhot but be known to those who know any thing of the constitution of the country—I charge nobody else—those who know any thing of the constitution—I charge not those who do not know it)—to be in substance a gross misrepresentation—“ the business of which consists in receiving the money. Whether the person be wise or foolish, sane or insane, a native or a foreigner, matters not. Every minister acts upon the same idea that Mr. Burke writes, namely, that the people must be hoodwinked, and held in superstitious ignorance by some bugbear or other; and what is called the crown answers this purpose, and therefore it answers all the purposes to be expected from it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 151 his hand-writing— then,“ March 14th, 1792,—his hand-writing then the words “two thousand members, scored under, I cannot say by him, but by somebody, I suppose for the purpose of being printed in italics; and there is at the conclusion of this minute in the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke, That the seeretary do return the thanks of this Society to the Society for Constitutional Information established at Sheffield, and that he express to them with what friendship and affection this society embraces them, as brothers aud Jellow-tabeteress in the same cause ;—of principle and practice I suppose. “ That he do assure them of our entire concurrence with their opinion, viz. that the people of this country are not, as Mr. Burke terms them, swine ; the writer of this must have known very well the sense in which an improper word, I readily admit, was used by the person to whom he now alludes,—but rational beings, better qualified to separate truth from error than himself, possessing more honesty, and less craft. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 153  Then this paper 1s thus ordered to be published for the primary purpose, I submit, of recommending that principle and practice, which makes the Sheffield people “ tellowlabourers with the Constitutional Society in the same cause of principle and practice, and which, both in the principle and practice, was aimed at the destruction of the government of the country; of that hereditary monarchy, which Paine represents as tyranny; of limited monarchy, which he represents as tyranny ; and for the purpose of recommending that representative government, which, I say, is the true sense of all the words which these people use: but this is not all—you will observe, that this paper of resolutions was accompanied by a letter, in which letter there is also the hand-writing of Mr. Tooke, and that the paper states that two thousan members belong to the society at Sheflield, and that this number is to be stated by publication, as the number of persons belonging to the society at Sheffield. In another publication they are stated to amount to two : thousand four hundred—in November 1793, it is stated, that they were many thousands : now you will see from the witnesses, some of these correspondents, these able men, who are so little corrupt, in the course of examination—you will see, unless I am mistaken in the effect of the evidence I have to offer, the truth of an observation that I made, that mankind were to be misled, and societies were to be invited to be created, by the misrepresentation of numbers, and by giving to existing societies a colour in that respect, which did not belong to them; for to this hour, after all the pains which have been taken with the Sheffield people (and what pains you will hear), those persons, who were two thousand, have yet arrived to but about six hundred. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 166 Now, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 191  Then, is not that a direct assertion, that the British government exists upon principles not reconcilable with the principles of a government that can have any security, or such a security as it ought to have for general treedom? 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 203 “ On Saturday last, the 19th instant, we received a packet of iale addresses, resolutions, &c. from the iety (Free Masons’ Tavern), which, on mature consideration, we find ourselves not so well reconciled to the ideas they convey to us as we could wish, if they had appeared in a different point of view; nor do they afford us such a Being pecapect, as we were apprehensive might be expected from an association of so respectable a body, under the high denomination of ‘the Friends of the People. In our opinion, their answer of the 19th instant to your letter of the 27th ultimo is no ways compatible with that appellation ;from the known respectability of many names which appear amongst them, we had entertained great i ot their real use,—mark the words, gentlemen—“ in obtaining a thorough reform—now mind what that reform is—“ in obtaining a thorough reform upon the principles of the rights of man,—that is, a representative government, rejecting the king, and rejecting every other part of the constitution of this country, except so far as it was consistent (indeed it is not consistent with any part of them) with the principles of the rights of man—“ which can never be accomplished until every man enjoys his lawful and just privileges. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 214 Our society meets every Monday night. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 216  This is in April ; and in August they expressly tell you, that there was to be no remedy from parliament—“ in applying those remedies which the country at tage may ultimately require—and they sincerely agree with you in hoping that the long-neglected rights of man will be restored, notonly in this country, but in every part of the globe where man may dwell.—We shall very soon transmit you a copy of our declaration, and hope for your farthur correspondence. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 247  They were pretty well aware that they were of such a nature as made it somewhat hazardous to publish them, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 264 was it to be done by parliament? The address of the 6th of August had disavowed that it was to be done by parliament. Is it to be done, while the other parts of the legislature hold their situation in the legislature? We presume you have the same object: tell us what you think upon this oceasion. This was the occasion, upon which the address of the 6th of August ought to have been explained, if they meant to disavow that they had any such object ; but what is the answer ?—The answer in effect is: That full and fair representation of the people that we are aiming at, is that which Is to be the mediate or immediate instrument of removing all the grievances we labour under, though prudence does not permit us to speak all we think upon the subject. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 267 It was the formation of a power by the people making themselves unaccountable to any other power, to any power but that which they had immediately themselves constituted, namely, an assembly by a convention of the people. Then, why do not they speak out? They say, “ With regard to our publications, our sentiments are expressed in as strong terms as prudence will permit, yet plain enough to convince the public, that, while we expect. every thing from an honest 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 298 Generous republicans, the philanthropic gift that you have presented to the wartiors of France—they had sent some shoes, and were at that time thinking of giving them some arms—“ announces with energy the great interest that you take in the sacred cause which they are defending. Accept the thanks of a society that does honour to itself in esteeming you. The time perhaps is not far distant, when the soldiers of our liberty shall be able to testify their gratitude to you: then their arms, their blood itself, shall be at the service of all your fellow-citizens, who, like you, acknowledge no rights but the rights ofman; then France and England shall form together a treaty of union as lasting as the course of the Seine and the Thames; then there, as here, there shall exist no other reign but that of liberty, equality, and friendship. May this day of felicity and glory soon shine upon the horizon of two nations formed to admire each other ! 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 300 “ distinguished in the annals of the world, as the day of the triumph of liberty, our first revolution—(Mr. Joel Barlow or Mr. Paine, one should have thought, had wrote it)—“ our first revolution did but show to us the salutary principles of the imprescriptible rights of man: all, except the faithless and the enemies of humanity, adopted them with enthusiasm. It was then that we formed ourselves into a society,. in order the better to impress them upon ourselves, and afterwards to teach them to our fellow-citizens. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 312 Gentlemen, the actual fact of his pronouncing it will be given in evidence: the date is the 28th of November 1792, nine days after the decree of the National Convention, which had promised fraternal assistance to the subjects of any country that found themselves oppressed by any of their casts and privileged orders, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 327 What is the latter part of the charge? that they do not mean to have a king or parliament? No—but that the opinions are conveyed in the terms, no king, no parliament.—Whoever shall attribute to us the expenne of no king, no parliament, or any lesign of invading the property of other meng is guilty of a wilful, an ayeuilenk, and a malicious falsehood—and then this paper, stating a great deal- more, which, in justice to the paper itself, shall be read ta you, concludes 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 332  “ and to expose in their true light the abuses which have imperceptibly crept in, and at last grown to such a height, as to raise the most serious apprehensions in every true friend of the constitution. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 339 The report that was made upon it was, that it had been offered to the Morning Chronicle the Morning Post, and that the paper itself, though drawn by a masterly hand, was such, that they durst not venture to print it—TI believe it was however printed in London. Yourwill occasionally see 5 pa printed in the country, at Manchester, if London will not do it; or if the law of England has reached as far as this side of the Tweed, so as to check the publication of o libel, then it is carried over the Tweed, in order to be published in Scotland, where. it might be more safely done. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 344  Are we to make an application to parliament ?—Are we to make an application to the king ?—That would have been, to make apPlication to the king, that he would be gra ious'y pleased, according to the oath which be takes upon his coronation, to give his consent to measures, which were to destroy the government of the country, as it exists, and of himself as a part of it! Or are we to have a convention? You will find, when the whole of the evidence is laid before you, there is a vast deal of discussion about this measure of a convention, there is a vast deal of discussion about applying to parliament. The application to the king is thought futile without more debate; but they come to this Metermination, that things are not yet ripe: but that the application to parliament, however, may be one means of ripening that which is not yet mature; and then solicitin petitions from all parts of the kingdom, telling those, from whom they ‘ask them, that they do not mean that they should have any effect, that they are all waste paper; canvassing all parts of the kingdom, and getting sigMatures in the way you will find, they send the petitions to parliament, which, for myself and my posterity, I thank God par-. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 353 We have to acknowledge with great satisfaction the letter which you favoured us with, dated the 5th instant, relative to the most desirable of all other objects, the reform of a parliameentary representation. The honour you do us in supposing that we are better fitted than ourselves for the promotion of political know iadees we must disclaim, because we observe with the test pleasure, that our country correspondents have too much zeal and information to want success in their public endeavours, whether at Norwich, at Sheffield, at Manchester, or elsewhere, throughout the nation. In our sincerity for the good of our country we trust that we are all equal, and, as such, we doubt not of our ultimate success. “ We see with sorrow the existence of those evils, which you so justly represent as the streams of corruption overflowing this once free and prosperous country. We see with surprise and abhorrence that men are to be found, both able and willing to support those corruptions. It is, however, no small consolation to find that others are not wanting, in every point of the nation, of an opposite character, who are ready to remedy, by all laudable and honourable means, the defect in our Yepresentation, the usurped extension of the duration of parliaments, and other grievancesSuch as you notice in your letter. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 355 most assuredly those who had said on the 6th of August, 1792, they would not louk to parliament, would not be so inconsistent as to say that they would look to it in April 1793—“ to that parliament of which we complain? to the executive power which is implicitly obeyed, if not anticipated in that parliament? or to ourselves ? 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 360 Resolved That citizen Barrere, a member of the National Convention of France, being considered by us as one of the most judicious and enlighteaed friends of human hans be admitted an associated honorary member of this society. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 407 The London Corresponding Society was not to be backward in torming this Convention in Scotland—and, accotdingly, you will see in the evidence, which I have to state to you, a considerable deal of contrivance on the part of the prisaner at the bar, in order to bring about that convention in Scotland; for, gentlemen, he writes letter to the ‘Norwich Constitutional Society, which deserves your very serious attention, in which he expresses himself thus—“ We have to acknowledge, at once, your favours of the Srd of September and 14th instant; utopia: of business prevented my answesing your first, but will now inform you that the spirit, shown in it, gave great satisfaction to our society at large. The rejoicings for the capture of Valenciennes were not confined to Norwich alone: the ignorant every where else throughout the nation betrayed their imbecility on the occasion—the taking of a town, the slaughtering of thousands. of bumaa beings, the laying waste whole provinces, or the enslaving a nation (however great evils they may be), can only retard for a small space of time the progress of truth and reason. Be not disheartened therefore; pursue your plan, instruct mankind, and constitutionally set your faces against existing abuses; be assured that many are our friends, who opportunity to openly join us, while our cnemies have much enfeebled themselves and their cause y their arbitrary exertions; despotism is at its last 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 413 Our freedom, as you justly observe, depends entirely upon ourselves; and upon our availing ourselves of this opportunity, which, once Jost, may not be Becovered so soon. I am glad to discover by your testimony that Iwas by no ways mistaken in the high opinion T always bad of Lord Daer’s patriotism: a title may be a bar te disinterested partriotism, but it seems he has evinced it not to be an insuperable one.

UNKNOWN_WITNESS 428 “ and annual election, until— ae ?— until compelled to desist by superior force. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 431 that, even if foreign troops, to meet the exigence of an invasion, were introduced—what then ?—“ all or any one of these calamitous circumstances—why calamitous ? they might be necessary for the very existence of the country—“ shall be a signal to the several delegates to repair to such place as. the secret committee of this convention shall appoint, and the first seven members shall have power’—to do what?—to do that exactly, which a national convention in France would do—“ to declare the sittings permanent’—why? Because the duly constituted legislature of the country had dared, not to do an act, but to entertain a deliberation upon doing an act—the first notice was to call together this convention, and being called together, their sittings were to be permanent. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 439 They do Not inform him in this letter, because letters will not convey every thing safely—that the convention was tu meet in case of invasion— that was a secret, which durst not be trusted to correspondence by letter, and because it existed in that motion which wasmade, every other part of it being communicated even in a letter, they consider it of such a nature, that they determine not to insert it even in their own minutes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 449  ‘“ Continue as you have begun; conselidate your own societies—unite with others— rsevere, and make no doubt, but, sooner or later, your endeavours will be crowned with success. : Gentlemen, I come now to state to you 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 471 That was an act to prevent convention by delegates with dangerous objects. Whilst titles of honour—no—but of dishopour, are lavished, and new sources of cosruption opened to gratify the greedy prostitution of those who ns the instruments of this oppression. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 473 A piece of parchment justice they call an act, in the convention of Scotland. — “ istrates have forcibly intruded into the eaceful and lawful meetings of freemen, and y force (not only without law, but against Jaw) have, under colour of magisterial office, interrupted their deliberations, and prevented their association. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 477 Now, did the convention st Edinburgh then associate for the purpose to obtain a fair, free, and full representation of the people in a house of real national representatives? if they did, they associated to form that house of real representatives upon this principle, that they were, as Mr. Skirving calls them, the people in Scotland, that they were to athliate, and to associate themselves 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 479 why, to meet as an assembly, which assembly was to control the operations of periments of that parliament, which must be the representatives of the Commons of the nation ; an expression, which by the way, they never used, adopting ene’ rally terms of a different import, “ fNational Representatives. ‘Are we also willing to be treated as felons for claiming this our inherent right? which we are determined never to forego but with our lives, and which none but thieves and -traitors—that is, persons acting in the regudar execution of the functions of magistracy— ‘can wish to withhold from us? consider, it sone and the same corrupt aud corrupting influence, which at this time domineers in Treland, Scotland, and England: can you believe that those, who send virtuous Irishmen and Scotchmen, fettered with feluns to Botany Bay, do not meditate, and will not attempt te seize the first moment, to send us after them; or if we had not just cause to apprehend the same inbuman treatment, if, instead of the most imminent danger, we were in perfect safety from it, should we not isdain to enjoy any liberty or privilege whatever in which our honest Irish and Scotch brethren did not equally and as fully participate with us? Their cause then, and ours, is the same, and it is both our duty and our interest to stand or fall together. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 484 Now, here again I ask, what is that fair, full, and free representation of the people, not mentioned to be in parliament? but if it was, it would be precisely the same phrase as occurred at the time of the Common-wealth. But they take upon them toapprove of the BritishConveation, and to unite the two nations of England and Scotland, to be a British Convention formed by delegates from the different societies in this ager kot professing to act as a convention of the people; I say, that it is ¢hat species of convention, which, in their opinion «vas a anes Sree, and full representation of the peopee, in which, and which alone, they hoped for that redress, which they could not bope for from the parliament of Great Britain, those, who were their plunderers, their enemies, and oppressors. Could it be possible for them to suppose, that they could make parliament the willing or unwilling organ of bringing about this representation of the people to subsist by annual suffrage and universal rePresentation? Could it have entered into their imagination that those whom -they -call their plunderers, enemies, and oppressors, would ever become the voluntary or involuntary instrument of doing that which was the object of all these societies, from March 1791, till they were checked in the execution of their purposes? 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 486 but what? but that bodies of men are to come together, claiming to themselves the civil and political authority, which exists im the natural and physical qualities of the people, and then to contend that they have gota convention of the people? 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 494  as Gerrald says—there he leaves it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 502  though the thing is couched in phrases that are a littleambiguous, yet no human being, judging honestly, can doubt the meaning of it; itis, that there shall be this convention, to act asa convention of the people, with the power of the people, having or claiming all eivil and political authority. The prisoner is sufficiently involved oe if sucha convention never had been thought of; but then the two societies form a committee of correspondence and co-operation for the purpose of bringing together that convention, which they had gail was the only mean by which Britons could enjoy their liberties, or protect themselves against the legitimate government of the country, including 1n it their plunderers, enemies, and oppressors. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 506 to anticipate it by means of a convention assuming the character of a British Convention of the people, but delegated from these societies, to sit not at Edinburgh, but to sit at a place, as yu will find, which they durst not name, and for the purpose of conducting this project with more security, as you find by this letter, to sit at a place that was to be kept secret, in order that the purpose might not be disa pointed. ‘“ A measure, they proceed, seis ing of a convention bill, “it is our duty to anticipate, that the ties of union may be more rmly drawn, and the sentiments and views of the different societies throughout the nation be compared, while it is yet in our power, so as to guide and direct the future operations of the friends of freedom. Rouse then to one exertion more, and let us show our consciousness of this important truth; if we are to be beaten down with threats, prosecutions, and illegal sentences, we are unworthy, we are incapable of liberty; we must, r, be exe peditious ; Hessians and Austrians—here is the idea that came from Scotland again— “are already amoung us, and if we tamely submit, a cloud of these armed berbariens Joy shortly be poured in upon us. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 508 “ of the societies, with which we are in correspondence. What, is that a convention of the people? or of the societies assuming the character of a convention of the people? “Let us have your answer then—Now, give me leave to observe how nearly this project was to being carried into effect—“ Let us have your answer then by the 20th at farthest, earlier, if possible, whether hn approve of the measure, and how many de bed you can send, with the number also, if possible, of your societies. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 535 One of his majesty’s messengers. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 537 I did, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 539 On the 12th of May last. Did you seize any books or. papers there ?—Both books and papers. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 541 I kept them in my own possession till I had marked them all. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 543 It is. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 545 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 547 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 549 I never saw this letter, so I cannot write ?—I have seen say. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 552 I cannot take upon me to swear that it is his hand-writing. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 554 I believe it to be his hand, but I cannot swear it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 563 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 565 Iwent with a war rant from the secretary of state on the 19th of May in the morning. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 567 We seized some papers in a back room behind his shop. Did you mark the papers you had seized?—Yes.

UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3332 No. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3334 No, God forbid. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3336 No, never—not an hiss amongst the whole society. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3338 Never. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3340 I cannot dpesk to that— There was no specific plan ever pointed out, by what-means redress should be obtained. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3342 No, never. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3344 No, I would not. Task you, under the solemnity of the oath which you are under, to say, whether you ever heard any thing said, or saw any thing done, that led you to believe, or to suspect, that that was the intention of your society ?—No, never. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3346 No; I never suspected it; I never cause to suspect any one. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3348 No; I would not. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3350 or did you take it on trust, from the opinion you entertained of the general objects of the society, that it was all as it ought to be?—I generally read it before I signed it, I do not know that Lever signed a letter till I had read it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3352 I did. , 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3354 I did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3356 I did not. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3358 No: I never did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3360 It was about the month of April, I fancy ; as near as i can guess, the beginning of April or March,1794. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3362 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3364 Never. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3366 No, I never understood it so. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3368 By petitioning parliament, at the meeting of the Scotch Convention; that was the idea that the Sheffield Society had at that time. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3370 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3372 At that time it was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3374 Yes, it was; and my own ideas. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3376 Yes, I was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3378 No, never. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3380 No; God forbid that I should ever live to see it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3382 Yes; I should bave thought so. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3387 No; I never had reason, in my life, to believe any such thing. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3389 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3394 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3397 Yes ; I did not know that was committing any thing that was wrong. I never heard that any thing was not right. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3399 The opinion I had was, that the people, if they meant to attack us, would do better to arm themselves. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3401 The opposite party to us in Sheffield. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3404 Nothing else. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3406  ‘No; never. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3408 No, I would not. " Pid you believe—I am not asking you the law, for you cannot be supposed to know any thing of the law—Did you believe that you had a right to arms for your defence, under the law of your country?—I did believeIhad ad. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3410 By the Bill of Rights. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3412 I do not remember any debate. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3414 We thought we had a right to detend ourselves, founded upon the Bill of Rights, against any of those people that might attack us. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3416 I have heard Mr. Yorke say so. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3418 No; I never heard that debated. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3420 No; I never heard any such thing. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3422 I cannot speak to what their business was when met together, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3424 I supposed so; I understood it so. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3426 I never did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3428 I did; I always looked upon it as such. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3430 I believe it was the cheapness of the article. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3433 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3435 No; I never did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3437 The person I gotit of said he had seen such things, many years before, at Newcastle. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3439 No; Not that I'know of. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3441  Yes. Did he tell you at what time, in the history of his life, he had seen them there ?—It wasduring his life time. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3443 No; he did not mention the year he had seen them in. You know what I inean perfectly well.— Did he tell you what was going on in the country, at the time he saw them at Newcastle?—I do not recollect that he did.—I think he said it was some time about the American war; about the close of it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3445 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3447 I t was Davison sent the letter. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3449 He might have the same views in it for the people of London, as for the people at Sheftield. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3451 I do not know. Why what cavalry was this night-cat for?—It was only a model of one; I never saw any made; it was never to be put in executon. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3453 It was when he was talking about the use of it, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3455 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3457 He called it so. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3459 I only, upon my oath, understood that he Meant the opposite party. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3461 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3463 I believe he of some persons being in Sheffield; that was the report. And so he thought so little about this innocent thing of the opposite party, that he Tan away ?—I cannot give any other reason. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3465 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3467 Twenty- pence, I believe. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3469 The hoop and the blade would come to that by themselves. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3471 Yes; there would be the shaft to it. ders 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3473 No; I did not. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3475 No; I never did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3477 I do not recollect that I had any conversation with him at the time. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3479 No; not that I can bring to my recollection what it was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3481 Yes.

UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3485 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3487 At the first institution of the society, I think in the year 1791, when the society was first instituted. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3489 I was not then a member of any committee, nor did 1 act in any public character. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3491 I never was a member of the Constitutional Society it London. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3493 We were above twelve when that society was wrote to, and therefore I do not understand the question. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3495 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3497 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3499 I never heard that subject spoken of, nor any letter to that purpose. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3501 I do not recollect an such persons being constituted a member the Constitutional Society in London; I do not recollect; I have no knowledge of any such matter. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3503 Letters were wrote from one society to the other. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3505 I understood that they acted in conjunction; I always un00d it as such, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3507 I do not know that any such subject was ever settled; I know no farther of the junction of the society but what passed by letter. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3509 Yes, about five months. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3511 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3513 I think in May last. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3515 The object was a parliamentary reform. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3517 By meeting and endeavouring to enlighten each other, and spread the knowledge both of the grievances which we considered to exist, or which were frequently wrote of and spoken of, and informing the ; 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3520 That subject was never discussed to my knowledge. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3522 I expect I am. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3524 It never was, as far as my recollection of it; it never was until the Edinburgh Convention ; I nae heard of universal suffrage until that ime. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3527 Matthew Campbell Brown ; but Iwas not secretary at that time; they called upon me to take upon me the secretaryship just after he was gone to Edinburgh. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3529 I know a person who goes by that name. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3531 I have heard another name. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3533 Henry Redhead. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3535 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3537 Several times he has been at Sheffield. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3539 This last time I do not exactly know how long; may be six weeks, or seven or eight weeks. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3541 Very well, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3543 No. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3545 He attended almost every weekly meeting during his last visit to Shetheld. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3548 I am totally unacquainted with tbat, for he did not bring any letter to us; I have heard say Did you ever hear him himself say ?—No;never hadany conversation with him uponit 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3550 No. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3552 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3554 He wrote several pamphlets while at Sheffield, and at several times brought some part, if not the whole of these pamphlets, in manuscript, ta these meetings to be read. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3556 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3559 It was a small room where these mectings met, but there was a large room when a great number met. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3561 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3563 Some two, three, or four times; I do not recollect how many during bis last visit. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3565 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3567 A little matter erected to elevate the speaker. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3569 Some called it one thing, some called it another, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3571 I never called it any-thing. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3573 Some called it the pulpit, some the tribune, but it never was christened.' But it was a commadious elevation for the orator, and some called it a pulpit, others a tribune ?—Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3575 He did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3577 Very well. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3579 I do not justly recollect the day, but I was there. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3581 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3583 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3585 He had a book in his hand wrote by Locke, and he expatiated very largely on the corruption that had crept into the English constitution, or rather the evils which generally are complained of, and showed there was a deviation, in some degree, from the original constitution of Great-Britain; but his manner of speaking may sometimes lead him to go farther than he ought. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3587 It was agreed upon that I should make a motion. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3589 He is peculiarly energetic, and at the same time very fiery, very warm, very strong; but at this meeting I do not know that he said any thing that was detrimental to the constitutional law of EngJand—not at this meeting. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3591 By Mr. Yorke and Mr. Gale, at a meeting previous. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3593 Yes; that I should make a motion for a petition to the House of Commons, for a reform in the representation of the people. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3595 That it might be over-ruled. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3597 Yes, it was so agreed upon, and further for the purpose of introducing sunther: motion in its place. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3599 I did, for petitioning the House of Commons. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3601 It was objected to with a view of making way for another, which was brought in and carried. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3603 There were only four of us, the other member I do not at present recollect: it was either Henry Yorke, Joseph Gale, or William Camage. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3605 lIn the elevation 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3607 Yes, one of those things we called the tribune was carried upon the Castle-hill. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3609 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3611 Several thousands. , 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3613 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3615 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3617 Instead of petitioning the House of Commons to petition his majesty, and a petition was drawn up ; the parchments lay at my house. — — 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3619  enry Yorke or Redhead. Pe a “J 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3621 Perhaps it’ might be drawn up before, and read there: I think it was, but it was not signed till after. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3623 It was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3625 Yes, he addressed’ them: he introduced that subject of petition ing the king to exercise his power for a reform in the representation of the people, and this petition was sent up to London to earl Stanhope, but he did not think proper to present it in that form. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3627 I remember something being said to him upon it at my house. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3629 To the best of my recollection, he did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3631 It was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3633 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3635 The substance of the matter he delivered there, I believe it contains. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3637 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3639 I do. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3641 I did not receive them from Yorke, but I received them at Gale’s shop. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3643 It was by the direction of : the meeting, previous to their being commu, nicated to different persons. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3645 The private meeting directed they should be communicated to different persons. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3647 They are: they are directed to me according to order. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3649 I do not recollect exactly, there might be twenty-four, or more. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3651 They were lapped up and directed to certain persons, and then ut together in a box. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3654 I was a cutler. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3656 Yes, when I had any business to work at. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3658 I was applied to 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3660 By one of the members, John Alcock. Were you paid anything for your trouble ?—Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3662 I should not have taken it upon me, if I had not been applied to. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3666 I heard reports as other peuple might do, but purposely avoided meddling, in thought or act, with any matter of that sort. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3669 I did, and it is proper that this should be well explained. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3671 A few days before this meeting, when it was spoken to as being the right of Baglshmen to have in their power means of defence, a hand-bill, a spurious hand-bill was published in Sheffield, with an intention to provoke the society to some unjustifiable measures, and it was spoke to in the meeting, that it was their right to have them in their own defence, and Joseph Gale spoke to it; he was the man. This wicked hand-bill was not signed by any magistrate; it was throwed about the town in the dark; it caused an agitation in the minds of the people, and it was ke of as being the right of every individual shee, to have such and such arms accordin; to their rights, lest any tumult or riot should break out. I am happy to speak of this, and 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3674 To the best of my recollection it was after that meeting. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3676 It was at a public meeting Mr. Gale spoke of our rights. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3678 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3680 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3682 There were manv others that were not members there, as well as others. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3684 The tickets were not regularly delivered, I believe, at that time. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3686 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3688 I never saw a pike ull I saw one when I was brought to London. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3690 Pikes were talked of, but r mever saw one tillI was brought to London, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3692 I saw a model of one, but it was only like the play-thing of a child. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3694 A little instrument standing up with a point about one inch high. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3696 No. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3699 I think there were four. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3701 That did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3703 This was about three quarters of an inch. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3705 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3707 Never any mention made of them in the society at all. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3709 At the house of one Benjamin Dunn. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3711 Yes, but it was not he that produced it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3713 I think they call him Charles Rhodes. — 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3715 I never did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3717 I do not recollect any conversi tion upon that head, but it was taken thrown upon the floor. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3719 What might be said that night might not be serious. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3721 Nothing was said, but he brought it to’ show them. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3723 I cannot call to mind any thing that was said, but this only, that he came to show them that such a little boy, whose name he mentioned, had made it, and showed it them. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3725 I heard no name of it till I came to London, there it was called a Cat. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3727 I heard no name whatever. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3729 I do not recollect any conversation eal but merely the throwing it upon the oor. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3731 No, laughing at it. pon your oath was there any conversation Serious or not with respect to Cavalry or the town of Newcastle?—Newcastle was not mentioned there, it was not at the same place I apprehend. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3733 I know nothing about any conversation about Newcastle. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3735 Upon my oath I never was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3737 I do not recoilect any conversation about its use but a mere trifling, desultory, pleasing, irregular conversation with one another. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3741 He showed it to the company as being the production of a boy, a child, I remember that perfectly well. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3743 I believe I never had. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3745 I had nothing to do with it whatever. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3747 I have been present at other meetings when he has not been so well guarded as he was at that meeting. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3749 So called, of the society only. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3752 I do not justly recollect at present. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3755 Comparing what he looked upon to be the grievances under which .we laboured, with the privileges which Englishmen once en
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3758 I heard him use one expression,—but for my own part I will not presume to puta comment upon it, he expressed himself to this purport, that we were in a low despicable situation, and rather than submit he would go up to London with the people there present. a: 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3760 We Englishmen were in such a condition, that rather than subm to it he would go up to London with the people there present, but he did not say for what. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3762 There might be perhaps 150, or perhaps 200. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3764 With some others. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3766 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3768 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3770 He did not draw any inference. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3772 I think it was before; to the best of my memory it was before that, but Iam not per-fectly clear in that. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3775 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3777 I do uot recollect any other that gave me any pain at the time, what was the cause of my remembering that, was the pain I felt at the time. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3779 Why, I fear God and honour the king. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3781 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3785 I have. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3787 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3789 It was not at the Castle-hill. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3791 At the top of the town in another place. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3793 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3795 I was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3797 Not so many.— 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3803 I cannot tell properly, there might be a thousand or two. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3805 To the best of my knowledge It is. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3807 Nearly 600, more or less. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3809 Such a mode has been advised, but was not regularly kept. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3811 I do not recullect because that was advised, I believe, before I was a member. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3813 No such thing, because I wrote the tickets down. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3815 No. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3817 There were a kind of books delivered, called district books ; they were not regularly attended to, that is all T can say about it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3819 They were printed by Joseph Gale. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3821 They were printed before I joined them. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3823 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3825 The members of the society, divined into as we may term them sections, they were called districts. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3828 Such a thing was mentioned, but it never was executed. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3830 About these persons meeting to whom the book was delivered, but it was never put in practice. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 3832 No, not properly attended to. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6123 I have followed the business of conveyancing for these twentytwo, or twenty-three years. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6125 If you call that a lawyer. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6128 As an attorney do you mean? 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6130 I never brought or defended an action, in my life, as an attorney. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6132 I am not. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6135 In Chancery ? 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6137 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6139 I have been here. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6141 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6143 No. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6145 I thought you meant a solicitor in Chancery. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6147 I did not know. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6150 I did not say that; but I gave you what I thought an immediate ane swer. I really did not know the term as ap plied to me as a solicitor. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6152 What was the first time that you wereat any of those meetings? —On the of January. — - , 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6154 I was sent by a gentleman. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6157 I am asked, wy lord, by whom; if it is proper I will tell, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6159 As you it 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6161 If it isa fair question I will answer it directly. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6167 It was a person high in office under his majesty; but permit me to add, I was not desired by that gentleman to conceal his name. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6173 My connexion with that gentleman has been for these ten years ; that is so far as having the honour of being personally known to him. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6177 Thatgentleman would not emloy me in any thing dishonourable, nor would accept it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6181 I have had the honour of his confidence ever since I have known him, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6183 Certainly. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6192 Certainly. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6194 There was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6199 Noy, I do not know; there was an universal conversation. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6216 I am extremely sorry for it, I never wished to mortify you. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6218 I have not left it off. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6220 I have not for some time. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6222 Not this six months. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6224 Certainly, you are right there. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6226 At that time I was a total stranger almost to every one in the room. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6228 I did not in conversation. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6230 Yes. an you tell me who used that language ?—I cannot, it was the gencral language. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6232 No I cannot. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6234  as many as the room could contain, and it was a large room; I should suppose if I said four hundred people, I should speak within bounds. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6236 I cannot: we were in two rooms there; the first room we were in broke down, which occasioned us to go up stairs. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6238 I was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6240 Exactly so. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6242 No, Mr. Thelwall fixed himself upog me, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6244 Quite so, for st that time I hardly knew Mr. Thelwall. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6247 I had conversed with him se. veral times. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6249 I do not believe he did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6251 H e had none of me, nor I of him. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6253 None. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6255 No, I do not recollect that ever such conversation passed between me and any man in the world. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6257 What passed between him and me was in going to Chalk-farm, which was the first time in my life I ever spoke to him; it was voluntary. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6259 Cery. , And Mr. Thelwall was for admitting them ?—He was, and desired them to hear; 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6264 O yes! I did say that, and thought myself very justifiable in so doing. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6266 No, I was not; there was a person present, was asked if I knew him; I said, yes, I did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6268 I was asked who he was, and what he was, and I said, I did think he was a person employed by government. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6270 IIis name was Walsh, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6272 I was applied to by several to know whether it was not Mr. Walsh; I said, it was, and that I believed he had some employment about government; and I believed Mr. Walsh did not wish to conceal it, for upon his buttons there was, I believe, the King and Constitution, so that he did not wish to conceal it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6274 That was not the reason, because he had the King and Constitution upon his buttons, for that might have been put on. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6276 No. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6278 The fact is, I was applied to by two or three to know ifI knew Mr. Walsh, I said yes, and he was pointed out to me; I said that is Mr. Walsh, certainly; somebody made answer, who I cannot say, he is just come from Ireland, where he has becn upon soine government. business; I was asked if I knew any thing of his being employed by government, I said immediately, I do believe he is. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6280 I do not think I did 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6282 By my saying that I believed he was employed by government,Imeant to say, that he was a spy. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6284 If you take it by implication that a, man employed by government Isa spy, it is so. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6286 Then you have it that way, I confess it so far. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6288 Yes, so far as giving information. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6290 Certainly, Mr. Thelwall did say so. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6292 It was large. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6294 Ie is no friend of mine. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6296 No, nor any man in the world. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6298 No; Iwas for admitting all spies too, and to let them remain there unmolested. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6300 I did not pvint out a particular man, I was applied toif I knew him, and I was taken to one end of the garden to look at him, and I said that is Mr. Walsh, certainly. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6302 I did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6304 I did not say that. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6306 I did mean that. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6308 I am not fencing. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6310 Yes, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6312 I was desired to point him out. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6314 I did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6316 There was good reason for that, because, it I had not said he was sent there as aspy, I should have been suspected myself: the fact was too notorious to be denied, and if Mr. Walsh was here he would not deny it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6318 I think there was at that time. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6320 I should think between two and three thousand; there was a vast number, I believe, that were there out of curiosity, but, as far as I am able to judge, there were not above eight or nine hundred of the London Corresponding Society there. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6322 Y es, in the shape of French knives, made in this country I presume, as many of them are, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6324 A s common as any thing certainly, and I belicve a great many people use them for safety to their hands. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6326 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6328 Ile certainly used those words. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6330 I am, and we both of us laughed. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6332 At the lady’s being an Aristocrat. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6335 I I should think there must be five hundred in all. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6337 Assuredly. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6339 I do not know whether a newspaper was brought in, but there were accounts brought in that some of the Allied Powers had received a very great check. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6341 I do not; I must add this, that I was very much surprised indeed when I went into the Constitutional Society, I there saw a number of most respectable gentlemen. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6343 Indeed there were. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6345 I have told you by a ticket Mr. Hardy brought to me; I offered to pay for it, he said they were not to be paid for. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6347 I dare say near five hundred;Ithink three hundred and fifty or four hundred sat down to dinner. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6349 I am not, but if I may a sume to think upon the subject, it was Mr. Wharton, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6351 Then I am not certain, and I will give you the reason; we went into the room, and there was a little bustle, and who was put into the chair I cannot say, butI consider Mr. Wharton to be inthe chair; but whether it was him or Mr. Horne Tooke, I cannot tell. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6353 There was a row all along, and they sat at the head of the table. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6355 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6357 He called the House of Commons a scoundrel sink of corruption. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6359 He called them a scoundrel opposition, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6361 He did, and he spoke of more than one. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6363 He did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6365 Most assuredly, he paid the hereditary nobility of the country every compliment that'a man could pay. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6367 I do not know that the word adventurers was made use of. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6370 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6372 I think his sense was the same ; T have no hesitation to say that his sense was the same. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6374 I am very clear he did, because he said, that the newmade peers, or those lately introduced into the House of Lords, either had combined, or were combining for the purpose of amusing that poor man, the king. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6376 I understood him completely so; I do not know one word that Mr. Horne Tooke said disrespectful to his majesty. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6378 I believe that was the object of all his conversation. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6381 In Mr. Hardy’s house. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6406 I did. When ?—On Monday the 19th of May. Produce it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6408 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6410 Yes, I saw him in the Tolbooth, in Edinburgh. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6412 I saw one laid upon the table, which Margarot said was his. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6414 It was very hard to shut; I could not shut it myself. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6416 Yes, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6419 No. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6422 No. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6424 No, it was laid for him to get his dinner with. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6426 No. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6428 There might be about six or seven. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6430 No, I did not apprehend any thing of danger in the knife when J saw it, only it was a curious knife, and he showed it to me upon the table. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6432 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6434 No, an ink-stand maker, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6436 No, afterwards; he was then in the Tolbooth. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6438 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6440 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6442 In October, 1792. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6444 At the sign of the Mansion- house, opposite to the Mansion- house. Which of the divisions of the London Corresponding Society met at that house ?—The division No. 12. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6446 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6448 It was the Rules of the ondon Corresponding Society, and the London Corresponding Society's Address. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6450 I do not immediately recolfect; but if one was handed to me, I could recognise it; but I think it is in March, 1792, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6452 It isa larger pamphlet than that. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6454 Yes; I told him I believed it was a societ; : ‘ 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6456 It was adjourned the next evening to the Crown, in Newgate- street. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6458 I did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6460 It was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6462 I did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6464 No, he was not; he did not belong to that division, but he belonged to the society. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6466 I was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6468 I beg leave to look at my minutes that I made from time to time. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6470 Yes, I did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6472 The next meeting I attended was at the sign of the Unicorn, in Covent-garden on the 29th of October. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6474 I cannot exactly say; but there was a very large company; the room was full; there might be about seventy or eighty people. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6476 Yes. we 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6478 As secretary, I understood. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6480 Being a young member at that time, I had not made myself informed: of the names of the delegates, nor the-oumber of the divisions. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6482 This was a meeting of the division, No. 2. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6484 There was brought forward at that time Tom Paine’s Address to the French People, and it was voted to be published and delivered to all the divisions. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6486 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6488 I don’t know that. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6490 Tom Paine’s Letter to the People of France, already published, to be delivered out, and the i and Duties of Man to be continued weekly. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6492 Yes; the delegates had received letters from the Manchester and Sheffield Societies, approving of the Londap Corresponding Society’s Address to the French Convention, Reported that two thousand and upwards had signed it at Norwich. The Ctown and Anchor approve of it, but would send one of their own ; thinking the more addresses that were sent to the Convention the better. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6494 A great many. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6496 The mode of conducting the divisions is thus: the delegate of the division attends the business that has been transacted at the committee of delegates, and he makesa report of what letters and what resolutions were brought forward and agreed to. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6498 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6500 That seems to be all that I have made any memorandum of. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6502 That is all I recollect at that meeting. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6504 I cannot charge my recollection who it was, and therefore I would not speak. The next meeting was of the division, No. 12, at the Crown, in Newgatc-street, on the 31st of October. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6506 Mr. Hardy was not present. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6508 At that meeting the address to the French Convention was reported by the delegate that was brought forward on the 27th of September at the Unicorn. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6510 I have made a remark of nothing more than that; 7 fancy there was nothing of any consequence. The next meeting was at the Rainbow, in Fleet-street, on the 2nd of November. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6512 I have not got the number of the division, and I do not immediately recollect it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6514 No, number 12 was the division I entered into; it was not that, but another division; tothe best of my recollection it was No. 11. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6516 The delegate reported, that the company at Stockport had wrote to Sheffield of their approbation of the different meetings. The editor of the Sheffield paper wrote to the delegates, that it would be a good plan to send London delegates down to teach the farmers politics. A letter from a Meeting just formed at Nottingham, addressed to the delegates—I am inclined to think that letter was not read. The next report was, that there were six honorary members admitted at the Crown and Anchor. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6518 Yes; that is the whole of that Meeting. The next, division, No. 12, at the 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6522 I will not take upon myself to be certain, but believe Ishould be right if I said that Mr. Hardy was delegate at that time, for that division. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6524 I found it in Mr. Hardy’s house, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6526 I believe that is Mr. Hardy’s hand-writing. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6533 Surely so. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6536 The next meeting was at the Crown, in Newgute-street, on the 14th of November. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6538 Nothing materialtanev; I have no minute of any thing. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6540 I return back again here to a meeting at the Unicorn, November 12th. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6542 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6544 There was read a letter, written by Mr. Barlow—his address to the Convention, very inflammatory, and there were very loud plaudits at the reading. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6546 The delegate reports, the reportis always made by the delegate. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6548 As coming from the committee of delegates, and it was Barlow’s Letter addressed to the Convention of France. The next is a report by somebody to the meeting, that the London Corresponding Society in London, in number, was six thousand; that the division, No. 14, meeting at Spitalfields, was increased, and would soon be equal in number to all the rest of the divisiuns of the society. The first mecting of the London Corresponding Society, I was informed, was at Mr. Robert Boyd’s, No. 11, Exeter-street, and that he had the first resolutions of the socicty ; I was shown one, dated the 2nd uf of EAinbureh he does not approve of the Address to the Convention, but was framing a paper to inform the public on politics, and would serid one svon to the society. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6550 Yes ; the London Corresponding Society’s address received by the National Convention, and ordered to be published and sent to the eighty-three departments. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6552 Areport by the delegate, of their Address to the National Convention of France being received, and that by the Convention it was ordered to be published and sent to the eighty-three departments in France : The society at Sheffield sent up their Address to the Convention to the delegates, who had forwarded it; that is the whole at that meeting. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6554 Yes, and they had forwarded it to the Convention. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6556 It is. The next mecting was at the Crown, in Newgate‘street, No. 21, division No. 12: It was at this division mentioned, that there was a talk of a congress to be held in Scotland. The next thing that was done, was to read judge Asbhurst’s charge to the grand jury. Rerted, that a society at Norwich wanted to now, if we meant to come into the duke of Richmond’s plan, or to rip up monarchy ; they suspected that this was to draw them into some unguarded expressions, and declined answering. Reported, that the delegates had wrote to the society at Sheffield, and at Edinburgh. The next is, the branching off of the new division, from No. 12; the branching off was on the 21st of November, and this new division took No. 23, and met at the Ship in Moorfields, on the 27th of November. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6558 I was chosen delegate of this first meeting on the 27th of November; it was recommended to inform the public that we were not levellers, and it was recommended to avoid riot or resistance to the laws. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6560 There was, at ,the time, but I did not make any memorandum of it, but it was on account of the magistrates interfering with their meetings, some of the publicans had been threatened to have their licences taken away; in consequence of that, this was a recommendation of the division. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6562 It was a conversation—it was a recommendation of the division that it should be carried by me to the committee of delegates. Reported, that in Edinburgh, the first characters belonged to the cause, had formed themselves into a society, and called themselves a Convention of Delegates, and it was resolved to subscribe for the defence of any prosecuted member and his family. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6564 It was conversation. The next remark that I have got, is—a meeting of delegates at the Sun, in Windmill-street, on the 29th of November; it was agreed to change the house weekly. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6566 Yes, there were twenty-two elegates met. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6568 The division, No. 11, had received twenty visitors rom Islington; a society was intended to be formed there— The sub-committee brought forward their answer to the Crown and Anchor, but it was referred back again to that sub-committee. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6570 The meeting of delegates must have had a letter from the Constitutional Society, which must have been read, and answered before I became a delegate ; so that what it wasI cannot tell. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6572 Yes; there was one presented by counsellor Vaughan, a visitor from the Constitutional Socicty; he offering an answer, it was read and approved with some alterations; there were some parts of it that were objected to, and these words were. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6574 Yes; he was a visitor from the Constitutional Society; the address that he brought forward was approved with some alterations, a part of the alteration was “ die in the cause. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6576 Both. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6578 Struck them out; but, however, there was something there said in justification of those words, by something that passed in Cromwell’s time, about a brewer being made a colonel—It was agreed that this should be put in the Sunday’s paper if possible, and five undred large bills printed and stuck up about the town, that we are not levellers, and onc to be sent to each division, —Mr.Vaughan most strongly recommended good order andpeaceable conduct. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6580  I did not see that; hut this answer, that was read that night and approved of, was brought forward by counsellor Vaughan, and these words were erased out, but were attempted to be justified. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6582 The Constitutional Society. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6584 Yes; if our funds were low the Constitutional Society would print for us. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6586 Mr. Vaughan said that; 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6588 Maurice Margarot made a motion to write to Mr. Pitt and the attorney general, that if our meetings were illegal he would surrender himself'; this was over-ruled, and it was agreed to support all prosecuted members, and recommended to all the divisions. — 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6590 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6592 Yes, I did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6594 I am your fellow citizen, “ Thomas Harpy. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6598 I did; but have no memorandum of any thing that passed. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6601 Yes: Division No. 23, December the 11th. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6603 I fancy it was at the Brown- Bear, in Moortields, but I have not got it down. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6605 It was reported at that meeting that the London Corresponding Society’s rules were introduced gmong the soldiers. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6607 There were no new members admitted. Was any thing material done there?—It was reported that colonel Dalrymple, of Edinburgh, was determined to have a parliamentary reform; it was reported likewise, that the Irish were scouted, as we had heen; that they had applied to the council, who had decfared their meeting to be legal. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6609 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6611 The privy council in Dublin. A motion was then made that as the finances of the divisions are low, as they. Seuties pot the Address, the divisions are recomme: to subscribe. Three members of this division declared, at that time, that they would stick them up about the town. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6613 I famcy that must have been the Address to the Constitutional Society, but I have not got the memorandum, whether it was that, or what it was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6615 I rather think it was. There was a report here, that Baxter, who was a delegate of the division, No. 16, was at the meeting at Shoreditch Church, that he opposed the meeting, and that he was laid hold of; and that in consequence of that, seeing he could not resist, he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out many of the society’s addresses, and threw them with a good deal of exultation among the people assembled there, and he complained that he was very ill used, his coat torn, and he struck several times in the church- yard. i 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6617 That was at Shoreditch Church. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6619 The 11th of December. , 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6621 It was a meeting to support the constitution of the country. ‘ 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6623 Fhe next meeting was at Round-coyprt, in the Strand, on the 13th of December; that was a meeting ef the delegates. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6625 Eighteen. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6627 He was there. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6629 It was there reported that the magistrates were after Littlejohn, and that he is now going to Scotland. That has nothing at all to do with it, that is not of any consequence—a Mr. Field was chosen assistant secretary. A motion from the division, No. 4, that a letter should be wrote to the common council of London, to be wrote bythe secretary, to whom it was referred. Mr. Ridgeway was to publish Mr. Margarot’s letter to the secretary of state, and the receipt from the post-office ; that receipt from the post-office was to be taken in my name, and in Mr. Field, and Mr. Bell’s names. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6631 Mr. Margarot’s letter to Mr. Secretary Dun das. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6633 It was directed that the letter should be carried to the post-office by myself, Mr. Field, and Mr. Bell. oa , 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6635 Mr. Marga rot's letter to Mr. Secretary Dundas. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6637 Y es; if Mr. Bell had any objection to have his name in the receipt, the reccipt was ther to be inthe name of three of the delegates of the London Corresponding Society. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6639  This is the letter. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6641 He was at this meeting. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6644 It was done at the request of Mr. Margarot, that the society might be sa‘tisfied that this letter was sent; and, therefore, instead of sending it down to Mr. Secretary Dundas’s office, it was determined to put it into the General Post-office, and then there was no doubt but that it would go safe. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6648 I therefore, in behalf of my lellow citizens, this day call upon the king's ministers to protect and uphold us in the pursuit of our constitutional rights; and ire, that in future, our lawful and well re lated assemblies, may be no more disturbed or interrupted by the saucy interference of usurped authority, by men unnamed, working with threats upon the fears of uninformed publicans, and boasting of szcrer orders and warrants—as though Britain was fallen under a despotic government, and liable to be ruled, not by laws, but ions, and to be subservient to ministerial dictates, written on a drum head, and proclaimed by the mouth of the cation. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6657 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6659 Yes ; a motion was then made to Tecommend to the committee to consider the case of all members being prosecuted, to be supported by every division, and a committee was formed for that .—Division, No. 1, recommended, that it: be represented to the public that confusion may be expe but:that if riots ensue our-societies will sid the magistrates, and that ‘wopies be sent to the

Whigs to know if the London Corresponding —It was approved of in the committee, but I Society would address the Friends of the Peodo not recollect that there was any thingple. Baxter recommended to take his case done by the committee in consequence ofinto consideration, he being prosecuted for 0 his resistance at the meeting at Shoreditch 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6667 He was not, but his matter was brought forward afterwards ; inquiry was made, whether we corresponded with the societies formed at Ipswich and at Woodbridge, the answer was, no. Mr. Martin recommended not to publish any thing, the times won't do; he says that you cannot oppose the treasury. Then Baxter brought forward a motion from his division, No. 16, for the delegates to consult and to determine whether they will sign the Crown and Anchor address—it was determined to be left to the 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6671 There was not. The delegate of division, No. 2, desires to Dring forward the cards in red print, and to be oval.

There was tickets till the quarterage be paid up—receivedan answer sent to Cozins of the Norwich Sotwo letters, one from Norwich, signed Cozins, ciety, by Mr. Margarot, that we will not sign secretary, saying, that there were meetings29Y of the meetings, and desired them to find held there as well as at other places to supr out some way of communication ; they sent rt government; and they ask in that lettera reply, that they had sent five guincas in Whether the London Corresponding Societyorder to have Mr. Fox’s speech sent down by signed at those meetings for the support of go- i yernment; it was directed by Mr. Margarot that this letter should not be taken notice of to any of the divisions.

UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6686 He says he was confined three days and two nights, but Martin “says only one day. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6688 No, I have not—it was referred for a month. Martin was employed for the defence of William Car. ‘ter, and there was a subscription then made for that defence; at that time division, No. 12, subscribed a guinea and a half; No. 18, fifteen shillings ; No. 11, five shillings. There as an intimation at that time that Ridgeway would publish any thing the society should send to him, he mentioned the duke of Richmond’s letter, and said that he would print that or any thing they sent. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6690 Some one of the delegates. Baxter’s business was brought forward again; Martin informed him that his recognizance was not entered at Hick’s Hall; he was ordered to withdraw his recognizance himself, and then he could not held himself again to bail in that action, but there was not any thing done in that ; it was then said that Mr. Fox had can expect, but we do not look upon him to be more honest than others, and think he has been forced to avow himself so strongly in the House, and it is necessary to have a lies 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6692 To the plan that was carrying on—it alluded to the whole. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6694 Margarot. Gay, a printer, belongs to the society, but he denies it; he em loyed William Carter to stick up the large bills in the morning, instead of the evening, which was thereason why he was taken up, this was reported at that time by Martin. The next is No. 31, Compton-street, 27th of December, a meeting of delegates. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6696 He was present. It was then recommended that each delegate take the opinion of each division of the propriety of admitting soldiers, and upon what terms. 3 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6698 Yes—The next meeting was a meeting of delegates, No, 31, Compton- street, on the 3d of January, 1793: Margarot, chose president; Hardy, secretary; Field, sub-secretary. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6700 It was proposed that each member should pay a penny each night if he introduced a visitor, to pay at the division he attends, and then to be discharged, paying at his own division. Mr. Durant, a stranger, acquainted us. of Thomg0n's distress, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6703 A mah that lived by 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6705 The wife’s distress, in uence of his being obliged to leave London, olay one belonging to this society, a very violent man, and he was therefore sought after; it was represented that the rent was not paid, and that she was quite distressed with three children, Thomsoa gone to France, the rent owing, nine 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6709 I have not got it down here, and I do not recollect what it was: it was some declaration to the public—rather have a constitution without a king than s king without a constitution : This we say, if reduced to be republicans. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6712 I do not think any thing was done in it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6714 No, only by the majority. Mr. Margarot then reported, that we had had no letters for two months, except one he had received that day, but the seal was opened and it was sealed again; it was then mentioned there were five delegates from the Roman Catholics, that they were of the same meaning with us, and it was agreed to try and see if we could not settle a correspondence with them. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6716 No, it was reported that they were in London, Irish: Roman Catholics. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6718 Yes, then in Lom don—The next is the meeting of the division No. 28, January 8; I have it down here, that the declaration, which is, I suppose, the declaration mentioned before; that division met at No. 38, Crown-street, Moorfields. , 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6720 No; I have get down here, that the declaration ; it is opinion of this division that it should be rejected—it was agreed, likewise, not to address the king at all. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6722 The declaration mentioned in the last meeting, I cannot tell what it was ; it was said thet Mr. Grey would not bring forward his motion for a retorm, unless petitions Lig sent to parliament ; ed to petition parliament by all means, af not to address them. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6724 Unless the several societies petitioned. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6726 Yes—The next is j} a meeting of the 10th uf January 1793, at No. 31, Old Compton-street, seventeen delegates attended; the declaration was ordered to lie upon the table; then it wasagreed upon that no written papers should come to a meeting of delegates but by a delegate, or through the treasurer or secretary ; carried unantmousy. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6728 Yes ; Ido not remember Hardy being absent one night; Mr. Margarot then reported, that the country correspondence did not shine. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6730 That there were but very few letters—He reported that he had sent a letter to the Friends of the People at Free-Masons’ tavern; the answer was read on the 15th of December, accepting our correspondence, that a reform by perseverance will be obtained 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6733 Yes; and that they revered the constitution for protecting persons and property, and recommending us to be careful not to mix foreign politics with home politics, and to avoid foreign correspondence, by which means they would prevent the imputation of levellers, and would 1 prove that we are other. wise inclined ; signed, D. Stuart, secretary, No. 52, Queen-street, Dean-street: it was then remarked that this society never had brought forward their principles, and it-was determined not to correspond with them; Mr. Bell, one of the delegates, in consequence of the remarks that were made upon this letter, made this observation : Our addresses to the Convention of France, prove, that we mean their laws here. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6735 It was not objected to; it was approved by all the meeting. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6737 Mr. Margarot said, no doubt; but there was not any Body else that objected to it; it passed with the silent assent of the rest of the company. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6739 A t that time they were under a good deal of difficulty, being disturbed in their meetings, and avast deal of very strong language had been held both then and at former times, and atterwards too. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6741 Not particularly; it was observed by some one of the delegates, that Mr. Pitt’s plan to add a hundred members to the House of Commons would not do, for wat alld al give them mes advan an us from: a proper reform; Mr. Gani tisen ast ‘he knew a person of the name of Dolon, who was secretary, and one of the Irish delegates too, and that he was ee off to Ireland ; that he knows his ad
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6744 In the French Convention. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6746 H e said himself that he had sent fifty of oor addresses, and twelve of Keirsant’s speech in the French Convention, to different correspondents in the country. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6748 I mean of the original address of the society, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6750 Yes,I called upon him; this I had from him at hisown house in conversation. The next is a meeting of delegates on the 17th of January. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6752 I fancy I shall come to it afterwards. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6754 At No. 31, Compton-street ; it was then reported, that nineteen of the divisions were kept up at that time ; it was then agreed upon to debate, and to consider whether or no the age ot eighteen or twenty-one was the most proper age for allowing of voting for a member of parliament, and one reason given why eighteen was the proper time of life to have a vote, was, it was mentioned that they were liable at the age of eighteen to be militiamen—A motion was made by the delegate of division 18, to appoint a committee and report Carter’s case, and his family, and of the money necessary for their support: division No. 12 recom mended to consider of a public meeting to discuss a perliemearayy reform, but that was referred back again; the delegate of No. 15 recommended the society’s addresses to be iven, five to each member, forthe purpose of Seliverin them out to the public; the delegate of division No. 4, made a motion, that. the thanks of this society be conveyed to the mayor of Glasgow, a society at Durham, and a society at Dundee, for uniting with us in our intentions, and that it be recommended to correspond with them ; sixteen dclegates met; a petition from Carter presentcd, he is sentenced to six months imprisonment, to pay a fine, and find sureties; it was a remark of 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6756 A letter from Norwich, that they admired our spirited conduct very much—that they wrote to Mr. Grey on the 11th instant, and to the Friends of the People, the Friends of the People propose a mild reformation--they want to know if they are friends that the societies are numerous, and in the count the magistrates prevent their increase ; signed, Blake.—that is, the letter received was signed Blake : Benjamin Hobhouse, esq. at Bath, had formed a society agreeable to ours; he advised us to point out a conveyance, and he would inform us how they went on, it was agreed to send a letter by the post, if it was not answered, then to send to a Mr. Richards, hookseller, at Bath ; then it was recommended to correspond with the Societies at Norwich, through the means of the Bell Society. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6758 Some society, I believe it was at Norwich : January ath, No. 31, Compton-street, there were two gentlemen came with a petition, which was drawn up, as it was supposed, by Mr. Harvey of the Temple—one of them was a delegate, who formerly had been delegate for No. 11, saying, Mr. Thompson's house had been searched m the dead of the night—Mrs. Thompson relies upon our sopra as promised—it was then determined that no such promise ever had been made to her—she wanted assistance to go to France—Hardy said, he had given her 2d. 15s. 6d. on the 5th instant, and then she thanked him—Martin thought it should be rejected, but it was agreed to—Martin then reported, that he had an er-officio from the atturney general, and he might be as much an object of the support of the delegates, and of the divisions, as she; upon Martin's exa‘mination, he drew up a long brief, and showed it to Mr. Vaughan, who had no objection to defend it—dfterwards he said it was indelicate to defend it, it being his own writing, and he wished it not to be known—it was recom“mended to apply to Mr. Erskine, but he declined it—then Mr. Garrow was applied to, he was found averse—then it was recormmended to Mr. Fielding, he declined it—then Mr. Warren undertook it—Martin said, that Grant was the sole cause of Carter's punishment, he had got the manuscript of the bill, and he declined looking for it—Martin wanted -to see it destroyed—it was then determined that Field, the sub-secretary, should apply to Grant, and if he did not give it up, thal be should be expelled the society, and then he would be expelled as our honorary visitor at the Crown and Anchor tavern. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6760 The manuscript of the bill, which was stuck up by this Carter, which he was imprisoned for: it was mentioned then that Littlejohn, likewise, was an honorary member, and that he would also be expelled; Martin then said, that he had seen Carter, who said that he had got in his pocket that which would do for the delegates—It was them determined that he should not receive his guinea a week after this, unless he asked pardon, and the manuscript was given up by Grant. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6762 Carter should not receive 3 guinea a week which he was allowed by the society. Motion from division 16, to address a letter to the Friends of the Liberty of the Press, for their exertion at the Crown and Anchor, the same people as met there under Constitutional Information. A letter from Norwich to be answered, but it was not A letter from Richter, saying he dare not attend us, but that we may depend upon his being a friend: he carried the to Grant. The delegates are to meet next Thursday, No. 8, Queen street, Seven-dials. The delegate of the division (I think No. 5) is going to France, and he has got some copies of T. Paine’s works; he received a letter on Tuesday night from a friend at twelve o’clock, saying, “a hint to the wise, you will all be taken up. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6764 Yes. The next is a meeting of selegeiea on the Sist of January. A motion brought forward by the delegate of division No. 16, which was Baxter, wishing that six-pence may be paid only to the society, and the other seven-pence to go towards the expense of their room, it was agreed that this might be a very proper measure to be adopted for pos divisions ; it was particularly remarked that at that time the people round Spitaltields were exceedingly numerous, and supposing that they should come to any open resistance these were divisions that ought particularly to be encouraged. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6766 A motion was brought forward by the delegate for No. 16, Baxter, wishing that six-pence (a quarter, it should be) may be paid only to the society, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6770 It is from recollection that I speak this, but this is the meaning of what was agreed upon b: all the delegates that met at that time, but it was particularly first of all mentioned by Baxt er. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6772 I have got no further than that it was agreed by the delegates that this might be very well in poor divisions, the other is recollection which I remember perfectly well; I have made a remark before of these divisions, that they increase so fast, that they were well satisfied that, in these divisions alone, very shortly they would have as many in number as there were in number in all the other divisions besides, A motion was made by the delegate of division No. 7, that Mr. Law's letter to Mr. Reeves, giving his reason for withdrawing himself from them, be published, to show the infamy of their proceedings, that the society was falling away very fast; but this motion was rejected, and instead of that, to publish extracts from “ The War, or who pays the Reckoning? deferred the selection for one week. Our letters to the Friends of the People, are directed to Mr. Byng, chairman of the committee, they have directed their secretary to answer it—their answer is to keep from foreign politics, to Keep good order, and by petition we may suc

UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6776 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6778 I will not be confident of that. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6780 It was answered by Maurice Margarot, saying, we mean to proceed orderly, but you are not explicit. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6782 In writing; there were several letters that were wrote by Margarot himself 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6786 From my recollection of what was often repeated. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6788 Margarot stated that there was a disunion between the Constitutional Society and the Society of the Friends of the People; but I cannot say I recollect exactly what was the reason of it.— There were thirteen delegates met that night. —A letter from Sheffield of the 1G6th’.of January, 1793, signed, David Martin president, Horsefall secretary, recommending a communication with all the societies in the kingdom, to form a constitutional meeting, and all to agree upon the same thing—asked how far we mean to proceed at this time—A reform nugatory, unless universal right is established, and they advise a general petition to the House of Commons, on the present inadequate representation—they want to know if the Friends of the People are true friends—Margarot says we are getting on too fast again, and that petition was not the mode. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6790 His observation to the delegates.—Margarot said, petition was not the mode; but at the same time it was agreed upon by him and the rest of the delegates, that petitions should be presented for the sake of Reaping. the public mind agitated with a reform. It was then recommended that all the divisions should go to No. 52, in Frith-street, and sign the address of the Friends of the Liberty of the Press; that is, every delegate wus to recommend it to his division, at the next meeting. —In the course of the mecting, Margarot made a remark, that our address to Mr. Reeves was not liable to any punishment, or he and Mr. Hardy would have been taken up, Margarot said, he meant to invite sir Sampson Wright to his division, or any one that he might send to the divisions, to show the legality of them; thatis, the whole of that meeting of delegates. The next that I have is only reports at the divisions made by members at different times.—On the 5th of February, in Crown-street ; this is. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6792 Yes; this is a meeting of the Division No. 23,—Bambridge read a minute that there are sixty friends to the cause, who decline at present meeting the society; but they are good friends, and sincerely wish them success; and some of them say, if they want money, they are ready to contribute.—He says, there are certain religious societies in the kingdom, almost in every town, whose sentiments lead them strictly to republicanism ; they are numerous in Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester, Hull, Derbyshire, and particularly in London. The society in London are just now beginning to organize themselves agreeable to the principles of France—their meetings are Mondays and Thursdays.—It was then suid that Tom Paine’s Works had been published in Sweden.—The next meeting was on the 7th of February, of Delegates, No. 8, in Queen-street, Seven Dials. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6794 He was. At this meeting it was proposed that the surplus of the quarterage of the different divisions, if there should be any, should go towards paying the deficiency of Baxter’s division, No. 16, for their room. We must preserve the divisions No, 25 and 16, being poor, they will be of great service if we go to war.—This was an observation from Margarot at that time. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6797 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6799 The explanation that was given was this—It was understood: 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6802 Margarot. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6804 He made use of the term war. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6806 Yes; and it was mentioned by several of the delegates, that it was eventually expected that there would certainly be a rising in the country. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6808 Yes ; it was taken up and spoke to by several of the delegates that night. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6810 I have not; but I remember it perfectly —A letter sent to Bath has been gone fourteen days, and no answer.—No letters received this week.—A Sheffield letter of the 16th of January, 1798, by order of the Society for Constitutional Information, conveyed to all societies, they request to know how far they mean to go—it is their opinion that we should be of one opinion to petition parliament this season—it will give strength to the cause.— The restoration of the right of election not to be under twenty-one—by doing this we shall know how far we can support Mr. Grey’s motion this season—no time to be lost—Hardy proposes a delegate from each division of the society, tu agree how to proceed—Mr. Fox has said in the House, the people have aright to alter the government when they please, the Scotch have done it, and the Irish.—The London Corresponding Society was first formed to send a delegate to all the other societies, to determine the best way of reform. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6812 That is, to agree how to proceed ; thal is another thing—next follows Mr. Fox’s observation in the House of Commons. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6815 is it descriptive of what was the intention of the society when first formed? or what is the meaning of it?—It is simply an observation that was made from one of the delegates, saying, that the principles of the society first of all, the intention—was, for arefurm in parliament. The Friends of the People in the Borough yet exist; and it was determined to communicate our letters to them and all other societies, and inquire their intentions.—It was then agreed that a circular letter should be sent to all the socictics in London, to meet two or three from each, and come to some determination. The question to be debated at each division, was, what is the best way of proceeding ?—This is to be done by advertisement in Saturday, Sunday, and Monday's papers, that it will be discussed the next night at each division, and that there are to be six advertisements—fifteen delegates met. It was then determined to write to Sheffield, and to inform them that we will answer them very shortly, how we mean to proceed.—The next is the 14th of February, 1793, division No. 19, met at Mr. Godfrey's, an attorney, in Fore-street, and chose him for delegate ; but we rejected him, being lord George Gordon's attorney, and agreed to reject connected with him. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6817 They were determined to have nothing at all to do with any person that had any connexion with lord George Gordon; and the division No. 12, had a n of the name of Watson, supposed to be secretary to lord George Gordon, that attended them; and it was intimated that lord George Gordon was by some means acyuainted with what was going on; that he made use of this Watson f; way of bringing forward different things;they conceived he would be very troublesome, j an that if his name was connected with theCorresponding Society, it would make them disrespectful in the eyes of the public; they then rejected him.—Division No. 12 to meet next Wednesday evening, at the Crown inNewgate-street ; but if refused at the Crown, to go to Robins’s coffee-house in Shire-lane, who would take in any of the divisions.—To be considered next meeting, whether you petition parliament—that will engage the public attention for the present. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6819 There was no farther proceeding upon this, than just remarking, that it would be necessary to come to a determination at the next meeting of delegates, whether it was agreeable to the differcnt divisions to petition parliament.—This was a meeting of the deJegates. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6822 by the delegates, or by his own division ?— By the delegates.— Agreed to demand a conference with the Constitutional Society—they are drawing up the state of the representation, and are going as far as us.—The Friends of the People do not go so far.—The Borough Society do not go so far. —The Holborn Society say they are for republicanism. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6824 It is broke up; and the greatest part of the members have joined the Corresponding Society since—The Aldgate Society is now called the Bother’em society —that society is since broke up.—There are about six societies in London to confer with.—tThe Friends of the People have not yet answered our lJetter.—A letter sent to the Constitutional Whigs at Sheffield, saying, we are about a general conference, and shall write to them.—There are two societies at Norwich united — the Constitutional Society wrote them to continue, and assured them we are firm, and mean to collect the general opinion. —Three questions for consideration in the divisions, whether they shall petition the king, or the purliament, or call a convention. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6826 Then Margarot says, neither peLition nor remonstrete, it would be unconstitutional, that finishes his observation. Then 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6828 The next is a meeting of division No. 23, on the 19th of February, ia 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6831  Printed copies of the petition to parliament to be distributed amongst the public—that means that they had come toa determination to petition parliament, not to petition the king, nor to call a convention.—Field met the division No. 12, at the Crown in Newgate-street—they were refused meeting, they then went to Godtrey’s, and re-chose himadelegate.—I do not know whether I have mentioned that this was a delegate meeting, on the 21st of February, at‘No. 31, Comptonstreet, this last matter Godfrey rejected —bee ing re-chose, he insisting on his rightof being deleguie and insisting upon staying in the room, there was no other way of getting rid of him but by adjourning to No. 57, CharlesStreet, to meet on the Saturday evening.—It was reported that a great number of delogates were in town from Scotland, upon a reform. —A letter from Southampton, approving of the plan, and want our addresses to forms society, and wanted us to correspond witbr them.—A letter to be sent to them by divisin No. 28.—The Constitutional Society have adjourned till the 15th of March, supposed to see what Mr. Grey does in parlias ment.—Agreed to write to all the societies, both in town and country, to send a petition to parliament—no time to be lost—ours to be drawn up immediately; and we are certaim that twenty thousand will sign it, if they are all rejected, write to them to continue; and then will be the time for all to unite, and to petition the king.—This is a report likewise —that the Friends of the People approve of Mr. Grey’s remonstrance—it is a leading feature. Reported that the serious stoppages from the bank’s refusing to discount, will assist the cause, from the failures which must follow. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6833 I mentioned it as a report —it was reported by one of the delegates, at the meeting of delegates—net that it came from any of the divisions.—A letter was read from T. Farley, esq. upon the illegality of imprisonment for debt, saying, he had been five years writing a treatise on it; and he wants us to subscribe to it—it was agreed that we could not give him that support'that we supposed that he wanted ; but, however extracts might be made from that book, so as to be serviceable.—A letter from the Friends of the People, dated 15th of February, in answer to ours of the 1st of February, signed by 3sE  
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6836 I rather think it is from some country correspondence—I have not got down whence it comes—it is signed E. Jeremiah Carter, chairman. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6838 A letter brought and read. Where did it come from?—From the Friends of the People, signed E. Jeremiah Carter, dated 15th February, in answer to ours of the 1st of February. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6843 Twelve de‘legates met—to write to the Bath society.— ‘A motion to be debated at each division, if they gave the delegates power to reject any delegate on good reasons. ---February 28--‘Meeting of delegatcs, at Mr. Stiff's No. 58, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6845 Motion by Mr. Margarot that the thanks of the London Corresponding Society be given to Mr. Fox and the minority of forty-four—the same to lord Lauderdale, 4c. for their opposition to the war. Agreet to be advertised in the Morning Chronicle, Morning Post, and Eyre’s Sunday paper.—It 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6847 A letter from Shettield, inclosing their resolutions past on the 15th of February by order of the committee. --- Resolved by the Society for Constitutional Information at Sheffield, that war is the greatest evil ever introduced to trade, This is my recollection of it, as near as I can recollect, that they return their thanks to Mr. Fox, fur his support of the people for many years past, most 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6849 Agreed to write to Sheffield that a petition to parliament will not succeed, yet at this time it will answer a good
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6853 The London Correspondirg Society have drawn up a petition, which as resented Mr. Gerrald, who said he ad applied to Mr. Mackintosh, who said he would go with him to get Mr. Fox to present It. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6855 Margarot wrote this letter of course, the substance of it was this. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6857 we have read it already— What is your next?—March 7th, 1793, Ne. 31, Compton-street, fourteen delegates met. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6859 Yes,—Read the pet tion to parliament, and refer it to be considered by each division—the title of the petition. The Inhabitants of London, Westminster and their Vicinity.—The discussion of that took up the whole of the evening.—That new delegates should be chosen on the 28th of March. The delegate of division No. 1, moved that the Essay wrote by Mr. Frend, of Cambridge, on the war, and published in the Manchester paper, be printed and delivered to all the div sions. Mr. Frend, of Cambridge, is tryin now ; and it is supposed he will be exclud the College.—The remainder of the evening upon the petition—the petition to be mace out upon rolls of parchment, and each dele gate to have one, to try what coffee-houses will take it in to lie to receive signatures.— March 21, 1793, No. 1, Compton-street— Baxter reported that, some constables had been at division No. 16, to disperse them, but dare not go up, the company being too large: they left word that they would come in greater force.—Received a letter, dated the 28th of February, saying, as you meet to overturn the constitution, you have warning that warran will be taken out against every member.—A letter, dated March 15th, from the Birmingham pociety for Constitutional Informatos, signed John Harrison, beginning citze Hardy, the letter was requesting to corres pond, to strengthen the love of the humea race, and to restore the representation of the people, it complains of the venal mode of 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6861  Grant and Littlejohn discharged from the London Corresponding Society, and to write to the Constitutional Society, and to ask for other honorary members to represent them. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6863 For withholding the manuscript formerly mentioned. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6865 I take it for granted from Sheffield; but I have not put it down. Litdejohn was discharged for the neglect, I believe, of his division; he was gone down into Scotland. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6867 In consequence of a former resolution, that if he did not deliver up the mapuscript he should be discharged ; and now they were discharged. A motion was made by Margarot to print a thousand of Trend's Address to Republicans and AntiRepublicans, to make extracts frum it by a select committee, with some strong remarks thereon by them. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6869 An Address to Republicans and Anti-Republicans; there were six to form that committee, and to meet in Paternoster-row, at Stifi’s house. The next meeiing was the 28th of March, at No. 31, Compton-street, a meeting of delegates. It was agreed to bring all the quarterage next Thursday, the Patriotic Society, in Holborn, joining the division No. 29, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6871 The same. The report was of the number of signatures to the petition; the whole was seven hundred eighteen on the five skins. A select committee chose to make laws for the society, and to submit thein to each division, to meet every Thursday afternoon at five o'clock; any three to proceed to business; other delegates allowed to visit. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6873 I have no minute of any debate. I see here is a mark made here—the committee to make extracts from Mr. Frend’s Address to Republicans and Anti-Republicans, they are to meet on Sunday evening—fourteen delegates met on the 4th of April, in Compton-street—the select committee to consider of their future regulations, first of all for the society at large—the general rules and vate regulations for the admission of mem
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6876 The next is the 11th of April, at No. 31, Compton-street. The report was that two thousand had signed the petition: resolved to thank the Friends, of the People for their impartial state of the Tepresentation. It was then said that the. Constitutional Society at Shefheld had done it, and had requested them to publish it ina cheaper manner. In their lelter they say the pape are sleeping too long; the ignorance, of the people is the cause of the continuation of the corruption of the senate—resolved to write immediately to every society again, and request them to petition directly ; small bills to be stuck up in the night, informing the public where the petition lies for signatures— fourteen delegates met—Mr. Francis to be requested to present the petition—recommended by division No. 2, to advertise a general meeting at some tavern, and we may get a good many signatures there, already signed, 2,519. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6878 TI was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6880 I made this minute, that many of them talked very boldly, and laughed at the fears of the public, they are sure that a revolution will take place in this country. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6882 Lord Sempill was chairman--.the next that I have got is the sentiments that were drank, The rights of man, May we never be ashamed to assert those principles we wish to enjoy—May despotism be trampled under the hoofs of the swinish multitude, May the world be our country, and doing good our religion--- Freee dom to France, and peace to all Europe--Thomas Paine. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6884 TI have senesced here that Horne Tooke requested him to be given a second time, may the temple of freedom have the earth for its basis, and heaven for its dome—may governments soon cease to be a conspiracy against the few, for the rights of the many. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6886 No; I have it so, by lord Daer, John Horne Tooke for his vigilant opposition to despotism—The victims of despotism, and may the people of Great Britain have courage to redress them, lord Sempill, Mr. Fitzgerald, &c. Those are the toasts that were drank. The next is the second of May, 1793, a delegates’ mecting, at No. 31, Campton- street. r, Fox wrote to Mr. Hardy, at nine o'clock at night, that our saying a radical reform would be understood uni
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6889 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6891 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6893 Yes ; on the 25th of September. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6895 I have mislaid that by some means or other. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 6897 No. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8312 I believe it ta be Mr. Martin’s hand. writing. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8314 I have. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8316 I' believe that also to be Mr. Martin’s hand-writing. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8318 Yes, frequently. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8320 I did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8322 Yes. When did you leave the King’s-hench ?—I cannot rightly tell, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8324 I suppose six or seven months ago. I Icft it on the 31st of July. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8326 Near two years, i you know John Martin ?— Perfectly well. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8328 He was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8330 I remember perfectly well seeing both the papers. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8332 I believe about the beginning of April. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8334 It was before this time. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8336 In the room where Martin was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8338 I had be told me he wrote the resolutions for the society at Chalk Farm; he had a copy of them, and read them several times in the room. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8340 I really cannot recollect; he often read them to one Pearce, who used to come to see him; he said he wrote the resolutions for Chalk Farm, and that there was plenty of cayenne in them; and if they followed his advice or example, there would be warm work among them before the month of May was out. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8342 Perfectly well. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8344 He took the resolutions from Martin to Chalk Farm. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8346 I saw Martin give the papers to Pearce. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8348 Yes, she was, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8350 He was there when Mr. Martin mentioned about the resolutions, that he had put plenty of pepper in them. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8352 My wife saw them. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 8354 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 9852 I am. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 9854 Ever since I came to London ; seven years. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 9856 Pretty intimately. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 9858 R egularly; he was a member of the congregation before I came to it, and has continued so ever since. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 9860 A very respectable character. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 9862 So far as I was connected with him as a member of a religious society. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 9864 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 9866 His gencral character, in our congregation, is much to his honour as to his moral conduct, and as being a peaceable member of a christian society ; and he is believed, by all in that society, to be a man of conscience, both towards God and man. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 9868 I never was a member of any political society. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 9870 I have known him these seventeen veurs. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 9872 I am a shoemaker. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 9874 Very well; I have been very intimate with him. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 9876 A very amiable character indeed, both civil and religious. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 9879 A peaceable, quict, well disposed man, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 9881 No. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 9998 I did once. Vhen ?—Near two years ago. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10000 No. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10002 No. 5. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10004 For near two years. , 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10006 Very little that I can recollect. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10008 A Scotch factor. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10011 I have taken it that way befure, it is the way I have taken it since I came into this country. Do you feel the obligation of an oath taken in that way?—Yes I do; I am perfectly satis fied with it this way. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10013 Upwards of five years. Have you known bim well during that time?—Yes; I have done business with him. “ What character has he borne during that time?—A strictly honest character, an upright peaceable man, as any in the world; 1 have ad occasion to call upon him often. Have you known him well ?—Perfectly well. What is his general character?—A very peaceable man, a strictly honest man, particu
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10016 He may have mentioned it, but Our conversation was entirely upon business. s You have not had any conversation with shim on the subject?—He might have men5 tioned it, but not particularly. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10019 A er. I believe, you are not a relation to Mr. 1 Hardy, the prisoner?—No. Where do you live ?—In Smithfield. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10021 Ever since the year 1779, or 1780. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10023 I know him by being a neighbour of his. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10025 I never heard any but the best of characters, a quiet, peaceable disposition. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10027 From what I know of him it has. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10029 And from what I have heard of him. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10031 Never. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10033 Your lordship, and the jury, will tecollect, that in the course of the evidence, a letter was proved to have been written by one Davison, at Sheffield, to the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Hardy, enclosing a letter (which letter was also read to the jury), which was requested to have been forwarded by the prisoner to Norwich, for purposes similar to that for which Davison is supposed to have sent it; I wish to prove, by a gentleman now in my eye, if the fact is not admitted, that that letter was found in Mr. Hardy’s possession unopened. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10038 No; I did not find any of the letters, they were all taken away by the peuple who came. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10040 I saw them. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10042 I cannot exactly speak as to that fact ; but I remember the messenger, while he was marking the paper, said, “ here is a letter unopened, I 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10044 I think it was Gurnell. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10046 Yes; which I understood to be a letter, enclosed in another letter. I said, “ open that letter and mark it the same as the rest. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10048 An engraver. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10050 At Sheffield. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10052 About twelve years. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10054 I have. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10056 I was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10058 Within about three months from the time of its commencement. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10060 Till the time that Mr. Camage, and other persons, were taken up; that is, I have not attended at the society since. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10062 For the purpose of obtaining a reform in the Commons House of Parliament, by legal and constitutional means. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10064 It was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10066 B y no means.’ 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10068 Not the most distant idea of it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10070 Yes, 1 was. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10072 For the purpose of co-operating with the other delegates from the different societies, in order to produce the object I have already mentioned. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10074 By a petition to parliament. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10076 I do not perfectly understand you. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10078 The effect of a general co-operation of the great body of the people, the effect of the general sentiment, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10080 Yes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10082 I did. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10084 Ry no means. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10086 I certainly would not. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10088 Certainly not. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10090 Certainly not. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 10092 I attended the latter end of the meeting; but I heard very litueo It. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11534  At that tine T had not. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11536 No. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11564 That is the first overt act stated in the indictment; it is not necessary for me to state the other overt acts relative to the convention, because in reality their tendency is the same; it only states the different means they touk in order to procure that convention, the ultimate end of which the charge states, was to accomplish the king's death. There are other acts charged, stating, that the defendant conspired “ to levy war against the king, for the purpose of deposing him. Another charge is, that “they did mect, conspire, consult and agree among themselves, and with divers other false traitors, whose names are to the said jurors unknown, to raise, levy, and make insurrection, rebellion, and war within this kingdom, against our said lord the king. So that you see the charges, stated in the indictment, against the prisoner, are these —The first is an act of his mind, that he compassed the death of the king. The next is, that, in order to carry into execution that design, to destroy the king, he did certain acts, stated in the indictment, which acts are alleged to have an immediate view of deposing the king; and from that immediate view of deposing the king, you are desired to infer, that the ultimate object was to accomplish the king’s death. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11573 but it is only an evidence—(“ if my lord Russell did design to seize the king’s gears, and make an insurrection in the kingom) of a design to surprise the king’s person. It must be left to you upon the whole matter—you have not evidence in this case, as there was in the other matter that was tried in the morning, or yesterday, against the conspirators to kill the king at the Rye. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11585 Ileave you to judge how material that observation is against the prisoner, when I state to you, that we, meaning to have proved the origin of one of these terms, in order to show tit was not derived from the French, were told that the evidence was inadmissible; that it signified nothing to the cause, whether it was derived from the French, or the Scots, because it was no part of your business to collect, from words, whether the prisoner is guilty, o not, of a fact charged upon him; theretore you may dismiss from your minds all observation upon the use of terms, when we were ready to prove, that a term they call a French one is an English one. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11592 If it is to be argued in this case, that we approved of French principles, because we have used French terms, then I insist, that it is competent to me to show, that a term which we have used, and which they have said to be French, is English, or is Scotch, because thereby I get rid of the pre sure of that term,—If on the other hand, it be not open to me to show, that terms which are used by the prisoner, and those with whom he acted, and that are said to be French, are English or are Scotch, then I am sure it cannot be open to gentlemen, on the other side, to contend, that we are to be supposed, by the use of French terms, to have adopted French idess, together, sometimes a fee of evidenee is offered to the general plot, then something that affects the prisoner succeeds it; sometimes a man from Sheffield, sometimes a man from one society, sometimes from another, sometimes a letter produced from one of the societies, sometimes from another, and sometimes from a third. I findit utterly impossible, in my own mind, so to separate them as to lay before, you any plain line of distinction which you could safely pursue. I must content myself, therefore, with stating generall what appears to me the tendency of the evidence by which they have endeavoured to show that there existed this general plot, and also that the prisoner was concerned in it. In the firstplace numberless papers havebeen roduced to you, in which you find very vioent and very improper expressions and resolutions. I admit that they are highly reprehensible; it is not for me to say whether they are, or are not criminal, because it is not my duty at present to contend whether they fall under any crime but that of high treason ; but it is the duty of my learned friends to point out that any of these resolutions, picked from the monstrous chaos of papers, that they have produced on this occasion, amount to an act of high treason. The point you have to try in this case, is whether they amount to an act which had for its object to depose the King, and thereby to destroy him. That the expressions are improper, neither my learned friend nor I ever would deny; certainly they are highly so—no man of sense—no man of reason—no man of decency would stand up to defend all these resolutions, or to defend expressions that are to be found in many of the papers, but they are not high treason, and that is the question that you have to try; they may show an indecent and irritated disposition in the minds of those who wrote them; but they do not bring home to the prisoner that guilt of which he is now accused, that of conspiring with others to subvert the state and depose the king, and thereby to effect his death. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11596 Certainly the prisoner at the bar, and certainly many of those with whom he acted, did highly aprome a a a re ove of the French Revolution; it was ikely that they should approve of the French Revolution, in its origin, because they were j Englishmen, and because they were Freemen, an because the original object of that revolution was, to give to Slaves the freedom which we enjoy here. What was more likely tocatch the ear, to catch the mind of an Englishman than that a nation, which had certainly been in a state of abject slavery for centurics past, was restored to that freedom to which they were entitled by nature? I know it will be urged against me, that, after that period was past (I speak of the origin of the French Revolution), after acts of enormity, of which no rational man can approve, had taken place in France, that they still approve generally of the French Revolution; but it was not these acts, but the revolution in general, to which their approbation went; and supposing that, under all the then existing circumstances in France, they had expressed a general approbation of the French Revolution, and the state of things, as they then existed in France, is it to be inferred from thence, that they wished the same thing to take place in England? Did the same necessity lie upon us as upon France? Were we an afflicted and oppressed people? Had we any reason to complain of an over-bearing Nobility, whose hts were inconsistent with the general rly of the people? Had we any reason to complain of the oppressions of the Crown or of the Royal family? Do you find, from the beginning to the end of the evidence, a single complaint of that sort? 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11598 No; far otherwise; it is not therefore to be supposed, that, because these men approved of the revolution in France, they approved of the late acts of violence that have been committed upon the persons of severalof the nobility of that country: It is not to be presumed against the prisoner, that he means to overturn the government of this country and to bring about the destruction of the king, because, forsooth, perhaps, with ri a misunderstanding of the subject, he ha’ pa cag an approbation of the French Revolution even at a time when a more reasonable man would not have done it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11600  Why, gentlemen, what man is there, who, if it could be accomplished with safety to this country, would not wish for an union with France, rather than such a war as the present? This was their object, as it will appear when you hear the evidence summed up by his lordship, from what I remember of a letter, which contains some resolutions addressed from one societ to another—I believe the resolution for addressing the National Convention of France ; —the motive which actuated them is stated there to be, to prevent the calamities of war, Surely, gentlemen, we have seen enough of this war to conclude, that, if these calamities could have been prevented, it would have been wisdom to have prevented them. The prisoner may have judged ill upon that occasion ; those with whom he acted may have judged ill; the war may have been a just and necessary one; I have nothing to do with that; but still you must allow, that a contrary opinion might have been entertained; and if experience has shown that the war was calamitous, and there were circumstances existing, at that time, from which it might peasibly be foreseen, that it would be calamitous; if an opinion could possibly be entertained, from the then existing facts, that we might have kept out of the war, surely you will not say, that the prisoner is guilty of high treason for expressing a wish, that an union might take place with France, when he declares, that his reason for entertaining that wish was, that a war which has turned out to be calamitous, might be avoided. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11607 From thencethey might have learned that there is a great difference between a petition from separate individuals and the voice of the people speaking in associations ; and you will learn from thence likewise, that, in the opinion of lord Camden, such associations were legal; mark the words of this protest; —“And, however some may affect to be alarmed as if such associations tended to dis turb the peace, or encroach upon the dele gated power of the other House; we are periaded it has no other view but to collect we sense of the people, and to inform the whok body of the representatives what are the sen timents of the whole body of their constitucnts, in which respect their proceedings have been orderly, peaceable, and constitutional ; and ifit be asked, what farther is to be done if these petitions are rejected? the best answer is, thattbe case cannot be supposed; for, although, upon a few separate petitions it may be fuirly said, that the other House ought not to be decided by a part only of their constituents, yet it cannot be presumed they will act in defiance of the united wishes of the whole people, or indeed of any great and notorious majority. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11612 So the law is expressly stated by lord chief justice Holt in sir John Freind’s case, his words are “ If persons do assemble themselves and act with force in opposition to some law which they think inconvenient, and hope thereby to get it repealed, this is levying a war and treason, though purposing and designing it is not so,So when they endeavour in great numbers with force to make some reformation of their own heads, without pursuing the methods of the law, that is a levying war and treason, but the purposing and designing st is not so. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11622 his house would have been rased te the ground, as doctor Priestley’s was, and another disgrace would have fallen upon this country, by the destruction of the property of an innocent man, because he had not the means of defending himself against an illegal attack. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11627 Edwards, a forward man, asks him (and it was publicly known that these people at Sheffield had been thus beset, and had provided themselves with these pikes; it was no secret); Edwards comes to 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11629  Three doren pikes in the hands of a few Sheffield men, and in the hands of a few others into whose hands Mr. Hardy might have put sixty muskets and three French case knives, against the whole army of England! Now is that credible? Can you give ear to such a story? You observe this convention was to be called peat soon: Can you believe that men who ly entertained in their minds an idea of enforcing by dint of arms the acts of this convention which was just about to be called, would have taken no farther steps for providing themselves with the means of supporting them, than three dozen of pikes, an order only I think for sixty muskets, and less than half a dozen of French case knives? Gentlemen, my learned friend suggests to me a fact that fell trom a witness to-day when I was not in court, and I am very much obliged to him for it, as certainly it strengthens my observation extremely; he informs me that a witness being asked how many pikes they could have procured in Sheffield (if they had wanted them) in the course of one day, tells you that they could have procured ten thousand. Why then, gentlemen, it is no excuse that though their wants might be large, the means of providing them were not sutlicienuy large; they had nothing to do but to signify what they wanted, and if they hed meant to support this convention by force ia Shetheld, in the must disaffected plece, as my learned triend says, that existed in the coum try, they might have raised an army of pase men; that is, supposing they had numbes sufficient, into whose hands they might tar put them, they might have provided te thousand pikes in the course of a day; am yet this plan of arming for the support of tk convention, which is stated, I think, to tur commenced so early as the year 1792. whxb continued froin that time down to the 12h a May, 1794, this array preparing against te government of the country, though it mkt have been provided with ten thousand pices in the course of a day, had for its supp«t oo more than three dozen of pikes ; and I dom know whether it was an order, or only 2c versation, about an order, for sixty musket for the Lambeth Association, and three a four French knives. The absurdity and probability of the thing stares me in the face. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11640 If proofs like these are to implicate a man in the highest crimes, by what caution can innocence itself be secured against such a perversion of evidence? Merciful God! how do we expect that thou wilt look upon us at the great day of judgment if we thus scan the acts of our fellow-creatures here? Because a man happens in communication with another, who is his customer, to recommend him to provide a few muskets for persons who are raising an association, which might, or might not be legal, therefore itis to be inferred that he meant these guns to arm this convention, or their troops, for the purpose of waging war against the government; it is a monstrous conclusion, it would be too disgraceful a thing to insist upon, were it not that there are other circumstances, which I know the solicitor general will rely upon in his reply, and from which, taking them altogether (for no one of them, taken separately, furnishes any colour of argument), he wishes you to draw the conclusion whic! this indictment endeavours to affix upon the prisoner, namely, that he has compassed the king's death. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11643 Who are the people that used th sse expressions? From whom did you collect that? He does not know; he did not think it material to observe.—What! a spy; a man whose business it was to collect information for governMent; a man, who attended the meetings merely for the purpose of coming afterwards and giving evidence against these people. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11645 Did he not know, that there was a great deal of difference in the degree of criminality, in those who said a thing, and those who were only present when it was said? Did not hs common sense tell himthat?— Oh! no! hepad noattention tothat; only that the conversatica did pass. To the memory of awitness, who gives you thisaccountofhisattention to such matens conversations as he pretends to describe, I think no credit is to be given.— Y ou will observe, whether the evidence he gives of any particular facts, is confirmed by other wanesses of a different description, and to whow testimony no objection lies; ifit is, you wil so far give credit to him, but otherwise joa will not. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11648 Mr. Groves's evr dence had two objects; one was to show, that Mr. Hardy, in fartherance of the des za which is imputed to him, and for the sake of arming this convention, which was to act by force against the government, bad provided himself with French knives.—A nother object was to show, that, ata meeting, held on the second of May, at the Crown and Anchor, such language had been held, by persuns connected with Mr. Hardy, and the same society, as showed, demonstratively, that ther must mean to overturn the king, and his go vernment. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11651  Mr. Horne Tooke, he says, after dinner got up; he observed, that he supposed, one vut of fifty of the people who were there, might be considered as spies, and to them he wished particularly to address himself; the witness did therefore attend to what he said. Mr. Tooke desired the company to observe, that he was Not in a state of inebriation, for, having something to say to the company, he had refrained from his glass. He called the parliament a scoundrel sink of corruption; he called the opposition in parliamenta scoundrel sink of opposition ; he said, that there was a junction between these two scoundrel parties, formed for thepurpose of destroying the rights and liberties of the country ; he spoke about the hereditary nobility of the country; he asked, if that skip-jack, Jenkinson, could be considered as one of the hereditary nobility. He was asked, how Mr. Tooke had treated the Lords; he said, speaking metaphorically, for which his lordship, I remember, corrected him, that he had paid the Lords pretty much the same compliment that he had the House uf ComMmons; from thence he meant, to be sure, that it should be collected, that he had spoken of it as of the Commons; that is, that it was a sink of corruption, and ought to be purified. These are the two main facts of which he gives evidence. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11653 How does it come out upon his cross-examination? T asked him, leading him as I might, he being a witness for the crown, whether Mr. Tooke had not said, that the hereditary nobility in the country, were a body ever to be respected? He said, yes, he had; he always had. I: asked him, whether his complaint had not been, that, by corruption, improper men were drafted out from the House of Commons into the House of Lords, by which the Lords were degraded. He said his complaint was, that the sending such men into the Ilouse of Lords was a disgrace to those who have hereditary seats there. I asked him then, whether he did not speak with high respect and regard, both of the office and person of the king? He said, yes; he always had; he spoke of this as trenching upon the authority of the king, and that he did not say one word disrespectful to majesty. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11655 We say, that the object of these men was mcrely a parliamentary reform; that they wished to bring about annual parliaments and universal suffrage; that their complaint was of corruption in the House of Commons; they thought a parliamentary reform would remedy the evil, and they meant to call a convention for that purpose. On the other side, they say, it was not for that purpose, but for the press of deposing the king; and they call a witness to prove, out of Mr. Tooke’s mouth, that that was his object. What does Mr. Tooke say? He says, that the evil lay inthe House of Commons ; so says the prisoner at the bar, and so he always has said; so all those that ever acted with him have said ; that it was the corruption in the House of Commons which had given birth to the evils he complained of, and that therefore the representation. in the House of Commons ought to be reformed. We say, that they never meditated any alteration in the House of Lords, or any attack upon the king; so says this witness, who is called to prove the contrary ; he swears that Mr. Tooke, whose language they are making use of against Mr. Hardy, always said, that the hereditary nobility of the country were a respectable body; that his complaint was, that members of the House of Commons, who did not deserve it, were removed into the House of Lords; that the king sires deserved respect; and yet this witness is called to prove, and that from Mr. Touke’s mouth, that the object of this convention was to dethrone the king. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11662 O ! never! he asked, if the knives were a saleable commodity: I said they were. To be sure, every man will talk in that way of his own wares; there Groves is contradicted. Did you say any thing, testifying any apprehension about selling them? Nothing upon earth ; the knives, he says, hy in the show glass, open to the view of the public, a public article of sale ; and yet Groves tells you, that he sold to him, privately, and would not let even his wife know, that be sold one of these knives. But here we pia him to a direct fact. Groves says, in terms, that Green told him (Groves) that his wie was a damn’d aristocrat, and desired him net to speak so loud, because the parlour door was open. Now Green, a witness, who is likewie called by the crown, swore, most positively, not only that he did not use the expressions imputed to him by Groves, but also, that be neither mentioned his wife, nor made use of the word Aristocrat. Then here we have one of the crown’s witnesses, positively and directly contradicting another of the crown’s witnesses, as to a very material fact, slid in by Groves, that these knives were scld by Green, under an apprehension of fear, and in secrecy: it goes farther ; for, in stating that Green ssid is wife was a damn’d aristocrat, he meant you should infer that he, and those with whom he acted, were men of a contrary priuciple, apd men who meant improperly to use these knives. You see the turn be gives it, is endeavouring to disti between aristocrats, and those who had french knives; that his wife was not to see him sell these knives, because she was a damn’d aristocrat, meaning that Green would have it understood, that he sold these knives to persons of a contrary deseription, but would not have her know it, because she, being of different principles, would disapprove of it. With these observations I dismiss this witness ; he not only does not prove any thing that would be advantageous to the crown, but his evidence is material for the prisoner, and he furnishes you with a lesson, which, I hope, you will not forget, when you are to decide upon the evidence of persons of his description. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11664 We hoped and believed, that that would turn out tu be the public opinion, and that the public opinion, being so peaceably represented to parliament, would bave its due weight. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11669 Government has prosecuted all the indictments, E suppose, that they mean to prosecute tor high treason, in Scotland, and yet not one of these may fairly infer, that no such letter was sent;delegates with whom Watt was, at one time, there is no evidence in the cause to show, immediately connected, has been indicted for  
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11671 Why? because the high treason of which Watt was guilty, consisted of a fact, in which they had no participation, and much less had the prisoner any participation in it. Recollect what is the account McEwan gives, when this project was proposed to him by Watt. He says, that they rejected it with abhorrence. Then, if those who were upon the t rejected it with abhorrence ; if no immete communication upon the subject is proved between Watt and Hardy, will you, by a long chain of implication and inferences, fix that upon Mr. Hardy, which the officers of the crown do not pretend that they can fix upon those who were immediately connected with Watt, the actor in it? It is impossible to suppose, that men of common justice, and of common humanity, can entertain such a thought. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11685 Let us examine that a little; let us see what grounds they had for really entertaining these opinions, and whether their conduct be not such as leaves you reason to conclude they are their real opinions.—The proposition of these men is this : That the House of Commons is corrupt; that that corruption proceeds from the manner in which the people are represented in parliament, and from the’ long duration of parliaments; that they think thisevil might be corrected by annuak parliaments, and by universal suffrage; they think the House of Commons will not grant them this upon their petition, because they have often refused them ; they think that the majority of the people (I do not say that they think right)—but they think the majority of the people are or may be with them ; they say, they wish to collect the sense of the majority of the people ; they therefore wish that a convention o delegates from different parts of the country should be called, by whom they should first collect what was the sense of the people by whom they were delegated ; and if it appears to be what they contend it is, that it shall then be comtaunicated to parliament—This it is said is mere pretext. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11687 He says, in his letter to colonel Sharman,The lesser reform has been attempted with every possible advantage in its favour, not only from the zealous support of the advocates for a more effectual one, but from the assistance of men of great weight, both in and out of power; but with all temperaments and helps it has failed ; not one proselyte has been nee from corruption, nor has the least ray of hope been held out, from any quarter, that the House of Commons was‘inclined to adopt any other mode of reform.—Why, then it is not a suggestion first of Mr. Hardy and his: friends, that the House of Commons was corrupt, and that this was the means of reforming it; his great prototype the duke of Richmond, the man whose a he has followed, and whose disciple e is, told: him, in express terms, that the House of Commons is corrupt, and that that corruption proceeds from the people not being oped re preneile in the House of Commons. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11691 A long exclusion trom any share in the legislature of their country, has rendered the great mass of the people indifferent whether the monopoly that subsists, continues in the hands of a more or less extended company, or whether it is divided by them into shares of somewhat more or less just proportions; the public feels itself unconcerned in these contests, except as to the oppressions it endures, and the exactions it suffers, which it knows must continue so leng as the peop: remain deprived of all control over their nPresentatives. What I call for, he says, ‘ is, not cocveniency, but right; if it is not a mazim our constitution, that a British: subject ist be governed only by laws to which be bs consented by himself,. or his representa, we should instantly abandon the error; batf itis the essential of freedom, founded on the eternal principles of justice and wisdom, 14 our unalienable birthright, we should mt hesitate in asserting it. Let us, then, bt determine to act upon this broad principle of giving to eyery man his own, and we immediately get rid of all the perplexitieste which the narrow notions of Partiality ad exclusion must ever be subject. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11694 He says, “ the weight of corruption has this more gentle’—speaking of a lesser re form, —“ as it would have defeated sy more efficacious plan in the same circum: stances; from that quarter, therefore, I hare malting to hope—it is from the Trey u large that I expect any good. Why, thes, when such a man as the duke of Richmond tells the public that parliament has been pe tioned so often for this redress that they il not grant it; when he tells them thet be still expects this to be granted, and tele 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11696 What was the mildest sense he sould put upon his words ?—From the people 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11698  
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11700 I think the most rational, I think the most peaceable; I think the most constitutional construction that can be -put upon that expression is, that it is to be expected from the sense of the people at large, first collected, and then conveyed to the House of Commons—not acting by force; unquestionably, the duke ef Rich
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11706 That he uniformly acted upon the duke of Richmond’s plan; that he pursued that only which the duke of Richmond wished to be carried into effect : that he promoted it by the means by which the duke of Richmond wished to see it accomplished.—Who, then, can say ‘that he meant any thing farther than the duke of Richmond meant? Is it not, I will ask you, possible at least to put upon these acts of the prisoner the construction I put upon the language of the duke of Richmond? Is it not Possible, upon all these acts, that bis object should have been for the convention to collect the sense of the people, and state it to parliament? J ask you first, is it not possible ?—If it be possible, and if you find that shat was the duke of Richmond's plan, and if you fine that this man has universally declared that his object was only to do that which the duke pointed out in his plan, surely you will not then, for. the sake of fixing guilt upon him, Presume that he meant more than the duke of Richmond meant—but rather inclining onthis the side of innocence—inclining ‘to a man upon whom guilt is not directly proved, you will say that he meant what the duke of Richmond did mean—that he meant this convention should act as the duke of Richmond meant the people at large should act, by collecting the general opinion, and conveying it, not by force of arms, but peaceably, to the House of Commens1. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11710 There were many more, some of whom are now acting in administration.— The duke of Portland, the duke of Grafton, lord Fitzwilliam, the duke of Rutland, the duke of Devanshire, lord Rockingham, lord Scarborough, and, true to his old principles, the duke of Richmond; they were in the minority; the motion was negatived; but they protested against the negative that was put upon that motion; they assigned their reasons to the public—they wished to hand down to posterity their reasons for thinking that that committee ought to have been instituted, and that inquiry set on foot ; and the fourth reason which they assign is this: 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11713 There you have lord Camden’s authority, that the people may legally and constitutionally asSociate for the purpose of obtaining an end which appears to them publicly benefieial— “ And however some may affect to be alarmed as if such associations tended to disturb the peace, or encroach upon the delegated power of the other House, we are persuaded it has No other view but to collect the sense of the people, and to inform the whole body of their Tepresentatives what are the sentiments of the whole body of their constituents. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11715 That was the object of the man who stands at your bar; that was the object of all those who acted with him; they meant to call, not an association of the whole people, but something less tumultuous—a convention of delegates sent by the people at large, by whose means they sight collect what were the opinions of tne whole hody of their constituents, and might, by the same organ, communicate them to the whole body of their representatives.— And if it be asked what farther is to be done if these petitions are rejected, the best answer js, that the case cannot be supposed ; for although, upon a few separate petitions, it may be fairly said that the other House ought not to be decided by a part only of their constituents, yet it cannot be presumed they will act in defiance of the united wishes of the whole people, or indeed of any great and notorious majority.—Then here I get another step; separate petitions had been rejected; Separate petitions might be rejected; the House ot Commons might not feel it necessary to attend to separate petitions ; but if a petition could be got from these general asSociations of the people, such a petition would be legal and constitutional, and, according to the opinion of lord Camden, ought to be attended to—ougbt to have so much weight in his estimation, that it is not to be supposed that so wise a body as the House of ComMons would not yield to it. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11722 How can ou presume against the constant tenor of his ife—against the constant language he held upon the i a the conduct of that man, whose precepts ehas constantly followed 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11739 Mr. Hardy’slife as been sifted : It is not proved, that; through the whole course of it, conversing with men upon the subject of this intended convention, and of the parliamentary reform? meant to be effected by it, he ever cisipgessingle expression, from which it can be col lected, that he meant to use force ; if he didi not mean to use force, he must be acquittefl of the charge now brought against him.—Thathe did not, I think this evidence goes fully to prove ; and, therefore, I trust in God that you will give him your verdict of acquittal. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11743 And you do not wish to add any thing?

For you are tl that a witness has a bias upon tis mind, theythat Yorke, Gale, and Davison,—and vw aye to try his credit, mccain to that bias.—recollect that Gale has absconded, as has beet It would, unquestionably, be necessary todoproved in the cause, and so has Davison80, if his bias arose from any other cause; but,Yorke, Gale, and Davison, tell them, thatit if it arose from prejudice, you are, neverthe- } was lawful for them to have arms; that they Jess, to weigh that circumstance, and see howwere entitled, by the Bill of Rights, to have it affects his credit. For the most honestarms for their defence; that this aristocrat man in the world would be misled by thatparty would certainly attack them, and there kind of bias; and whien you hear personsfore they ought to provide arms.

For Widdison states, thatpressions of Mr. Yorke, which he recollected, he had agreed in opinion with Yorke; thatas improper expressions, because be felt pal some few weeks before Yorke left Sheffield, when they were used. oe he hada conversation with him about universalThese men were men of that descripts, suffrage ; he told Yorke, he thought that wasthat it required, that they should be going too far, and that he would have nothingto a great degrec to induce them toarm more to do with it. What could have madeselves, under pretence of defending the this alteration in the mind of Widdison, if heselves 3 but when they were once araned, ‘had not perceived, as the matter developedwhat importance was it, whether the ground itself, things which were concealed from himupon which they had been induced 108 before? As he saw farther into the business, was to defend themselves, or not? If ter he thought he saw danger in it, and thereforehad the arms in their hands, they might he would have nouns more to do with it. them offensively, as well as defe a Gentlemen, you will recollect that WiddisonThat the persons who had the directioD a was one of the Sheffield committee, and yetbusiness must very well know, and they i" -he never saw Davison’s letter about the pikes not persons of inferior understanding— 7Now that is an extremely striking circum-Yorke has been described as a perso of superior understanding. He well knew, that, if those personsapprehended any injury to themselves, an application to a magistrate would have tended most effectually to their protection; but he never told them to make that application, He never told them, “If you are afraid of having your houses burnt, or of being insulted in any way, apply to a magistrate for protection. No; he rather chose tomake an impression upon their minds by what had passed from the Church and King party. I can easily conceive, that a violent party might have done very improper things, and very blameable; but use is made of that to induce these men to arm themselves; and that idea being once entertained, you can easily conceive to what length it might be carnied, particularly when you recollect what dropped from one of the witnesses for the prisoner—that there was no difficulty whatever, when the plan was once settled, of having ten thousand pikes forged at Slicfheld, in one day; therefore, all that was wanted was, to have the plan settled ; that they should have some pikes, so that they might know what sort of thing to order ; that the price, which is a very eheap one, should be fixed, and the other little: circumstances arranged, of the length of the pole, and the materials of which it was to be made; and then a very few days would have armed a very large body of men, at Sheffiel, with these pikes; and a body, so armed, might have been used in the manner which you will recollect Yorke stated to Broomhead, and in which those who governed them were well disposed to use them; namely, that rather than be trampled upon, in the way in which they were supposed to be trampled upon, he would have gone at their head, to London. A body of ten thousand men, with pikes, thus led, might have been like the Marsellois you have so often heard of, who have acted at Paris, ia a manner not the most agreeable to humanity. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11764 Now, gentlemen, let me call to your minds what change has been made in the constitution of the House of Commons, since. the Revolution in 1683, soon after the Revolution the triennial bill passed, and the septennial act has since followed, That is the sole and only change, since the Revolution, in the House of Commons, except several bills which have had for their object to exclude from the House of Commons, persons holding particular places under the crown, and persons having offices in the collection of the revenue, which might be considered as making them dependant; so that the alteration in the House of Commons since the year 1688, must be considered as rather for the benefit of the people, than disadvantageous to them; and therefore it is clear that the statement which had been made to this Man on the subject, was a mere delusion upon his senses; it is impossible that the facts should have been stated to him in such a manner as to make him fairly comprehend them. And this was not theenly man who was deceived upon this subject ; for I think I remember another witness who said he was for restoring the constitution, as it was in 1688. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11767 When this business rst came within my notice, I looked into the constitutions of those states which have been supposed to have provisions of this kind, of the most extraordinary nature ; and I believe the Republic of Venice is considered as having the most extraordinary. They have no provision so tyrannical in its nature, or which tight lead to such dreadful consequences, as this Committee of Secrecy, the very names of whose members are unknown. So that this London Corresponding Society, a little state within the state; for such it is, and that is the danger of it, that it isa state within the great state, which is always a dangerous thing to the community ; this London 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11769 such a proceeding needs nos crecy; it might have been fairly and opealy avowed, as it has been fairly and opealy avowed. For, gentlemen, in this country 9 culative opinions upon government, and upoo any other subject, if they do not immediately tend, by the proceedings taken upon them, by the manner in which they are circulated, and other circumstances, to disturb the quiet of the state, remain untouched,—If they do teod to disturb the quiet of the state, unquestio ably they are necessarily an object of snimadversion: for no state can exist, if perpelull means are taken to disturb the public opinion in favour of its government—for upon what rests the authority of all governments -vernment can be administered only by in prapey oat to the whdle body ; nothing an induce obedience by the many, but an opined that in some way or other their good 1s best consulted by that obedience.—Habits of obedience, habits of submission to particular4ss, induce submission to governments which we (used as we are to the government which the constitution of this country has provic think terrible. That habit of submission duces the inhabitants of those countries continue to submit to the inconveniences they experience, rather than to endanger thet own particular happiness by resistance. Bat if a society may be formed in a state, such a secret committee, accompanied wt! such circumstances, it appears to me that D0 state can be safe. However wisely its vernment may be constituted, however pro perly that government may be administer (so far as the imperfection of the human admits of governments being wisely forme or wisely administered) yet by lowering itthe public opinion, any government whatere! may be destroyed. ‘ entlemen, you will recollect that eve the French Revolution, of which we bir? 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11781 Probably this was a sudden thought; and I think, when I come to investigate the transaction more particularly, you will be of opinion that it was so, But it demonstrates that the prisoner had the contrivance of all the transactions, and particularly of this transaction. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11787  These are charges which relate to the assembling the convention.—There is a charge of procuring arms, to oppose with force the foreibly to alter the legislature, and the king.—There is another charge of aco spiracy to levy war—another of a consping to alter the goveramentand depose the king— and others which are nearly of the sam effect, intended to meet all possible ass which might arise on the evidence which has been laid before you.—It is for you to judg, from that evidence, whether the prisonerit the bar, and those with whom it is alleged he conspired, had formed any design which would render their minds guilty within the meaning of the law; and whether he had & monstrated this criminal intent by any act, acts, in furtherance of it, so as to bring him within the penalty of the law. And, genie men, you must likewise consider, whether tk acts so done, have been proved as the law re. quires; that is, one act by two witnesses, a two acts, each by one witness; and whether you give credit to the evidence. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11791 The necessity is clear andplain: An association of people, forming astate, must have some form of government by which the whole body must be submitted to some power. That power is difterently constituted in different governments; but in every government it must of necessity be sovereign, Whatever that power is, it must act for the whole body, it must represent the whole body, and the act of that sovereign wer must, in the government of that state, e taken to be the will of the whole. A state cannot exist without such sovereign power; it is the great bond which binds the whole together, and makes it really a state (for, without such 2 power to control, as well as to direct the actions of all individuals in the state, they never could act as one body, and asa state), thus giving to the whole body the unity which belongs to one person. The conSequence is, that any attempt to destroy the constitution of the power so established, is Necessarily an attempt to destroy the very ; purpose of the association by which the state 1s formed, and consequently to subvert the State itself; for the constitution of the soveTeign power is an essential part of the agrecment, or the compact, or whatever you will call it, upon which the people are united together in one association. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11794 For, previous to Edward Srd’s time, the crime of treason was acrime known to the law, and its unishment was defined. The defect in the law was, that the crime itself was not so clearly defined as the safety of the subject reuired; and therefore the law was made for the safety of the subject, that those acts which were notin so great a degree dangerous to the state, should not be so penal. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11796 At the head of this definition, is the compassin and imagining the death of the king; suc conipesing and imagining, or purpose of the mind, being manifested by some overt act.— That is the language of our law.—Upon the construction of this law I must confess that hitherto no sort of doubt has occurred to my mind. Ithas been attempted by the counsel for the prisoner to raise a doubt upon it, and particularly by the learned gentleman who is the leading counsel for the prisoner.—It seemed to me (and, notwithstanding the explanation which he thouglit proper to give, it still seems to me) that, in so doing, he contradicted that assertion which unquestionably he made in the character of an advocate in lord George Gordon’s case, that, ‘¢ The plain, unextended letter of this act of Edward srd was thought to be a sufficient protection to the person and honour of the sovereign, and an adequate security for the laws committed to his execution.—Speaking of the statute as consisting of different and distinct members, he adds, “ I shall mention only two of the number, the other not being in the remotest degree applicable to the present accusation, To compass or imagine the death of the king ; such imagination, or purpose of the mind, visible only to its great Author, being manifested by some open act ; an institution obviously directed, not only to the sccurity of his natural person, but to the stability of the government; the life of the prince being so ine terwoven with the constitution of the state, that an attempt to destroy the one, is justly held to be a rebellious conspiracy against the other, There I make use of the words of my learned friend; and [am sure, whenever I make use of his words, 1 cannot make use of better.— 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11799 There cannot be any other than this; that a conspiracy against the life of the prince is a conspiracy against the constitution of the state, and a conspiracy against the constitution of the state is a conspiracy against the life of the prince; the life ofthe prince being so interwoven with the constitution of the state, that an attempt to destroy the one is justly held to be a rebellious conspiracy against the other.—The provision is not with a particular view to the distinct person of the man, though it is intended to preserve great reverence to whoever is upon the throne of the country, but it is because he is the king; but can it be supposed, that when the legislature was making a law upon this subject, for the express purpose of defining those crimes which should be deemed treason, it should have overlooked that sort of provision which was necessary for the preservation of the constitution of the state itself; that the law should so have remained until thisday, and that it should be necessary, in the language of my learned friend, to resort to parliament, for an act to be made upon the subject ? 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11837 This original and continual right of universal suffrage is also a necessary consequence of the right of equal, active citizenship; because that equality must necessarily fe destroyed by long delegation of either legislative or executive power; and therefore the delegation must be renewed as often as circumstances will admit.A fourth necessary consequence is, the right of perpetual revolution. The right of ging their constitution and government, when, as often, and in what manner they may think proper ; still, necessarily, according to their principles, adhering to some form of Tepresentative government, frequently to be renewed; because any fourm of government, which is not a representative government, and is not frequently renewed, is necessarily contrary to the right of equal, active citizenship; and it therefore is,.according to their principles, an usurpation of the indefeasible tights of man, and is unlawful—tyranny— despotism—or is liable to any other of the harsh appellations which they are pleased to apply to every existing government in the world.— —Gentlemen, this conclusion is inevitable from the principle which they assume, of equal, active citizenship—I certainly will not here dispute-with them the truth of their assumption, whether it is well or ill founded. I think it would be no very difficult task to prove that it is ill-founded; and for this reason, if for no other, that it necessarily leads to persue! and constant revolution. But, without entering into any discussion upon the subject, it is sufficient that these are no principles, nor ever have been conceived to be principles, in the English constitution: They are utterly inconsistent with monarchy ; they are utterly inconsistent with a House of Lords, and with many other parts of our establishment; and therefore, persons who at. tempt to procure the establishment of these principles, as principles upon which the constitution and government of this country ought to be founded, and who hold that any government founded upon other principles, is necessarily an usurpation of their indefeasible rights, if they take any steps whatever for the purpose of altering the established government, they must be conceived, prime facie, to have within their view the intent of destroying the existing government, of abolishing the kingly office, of abolishing the House of Lords, and all the great officers, ranks, and distinctions in this country; of abolishing also the House of Commons, as it is now established, and of forming a constitution of government upon their own principles because no other constitution of government can, according to the tenets which they hold, be a lawful government. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11839 Then, if these persons formed a design of procuring any alteration ef the constitution, otherwise than by means of the constituted legislature, acting as free agents, they formed a design to depose the king from his royal authority ; and that deposition is, if 1am sight in the lawIhave stated, compassing the death of the king; and this being manifested by any act in pursuance of the design, the measure of their guilt was full ; they were guilty of high treason—for, if any y is attempted to be made in the constitution of the sovereign power of a state, otherwise than by its own authority, from the mement the attempt begins to operate, the constituted sovereign power of the state ceases to be such, is deposed from its authority, at least to ihe extent necessary to effect the particular change. The law of England admits of no distiaction between the deposition of the king :for a day or an hour, and his deposition for ever. The guilt of high treason attaches to the first, as well as to the last; for an attempt to de the king his sovereign authority, ig day hour, must-hazard his life—A conspiracy for shat purpose is, ing: hi death, and is high treasom, oran 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11842 They would look for relief to the own laws, and not to se lees of their fd moies, their pluaderers, and appressers.— declare, therefore, that they consider tt existing government of the country, by tt King, Lords, and Commons, as that of thes enemies, their plunderers, and oppress: that application to them they will not mle: that application to the king, distinctly, vou be futile ; that they would look, therefor, their own means, those means being own laws, to be effected by their own cacy. Thave not a conception ‘of words that vil more expressly declare that it vas thet intent, by their own force te effectuste ht change which they wished to have io the vernment of the country.—To a degree, it le certainly been proved, that they tookatowards the assembling of such s meci7gthey had proposed to assemble. The nth of the meeting intended to have bees poe ee ape pemers intended ta saith been assum meeting, are matier pute ; but it is not disputed that they looks to that meeting, in some way or othe, effect their .— How was it (0 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11845 They had a bill framed, intended to be introduced into parliament; they applied to parliament upon the subject, and a bill was brought into parliament. To draw any comparison between that sort of meeting, and that which these persons proposed to have, seems to me to be poverty absurd. I observe, Mr. Gibbs it 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11848  But, gentlemen, when one recollccts all that they have declared uponthe subject; when one recollects that they have repeatedly declared that the people were not to look for relief from the parliament, as it was constituted ; that it was not to be expected of those who were in le; when they declared they derers, and oppressors; I can conceive no words, than that of considering in what manner they should obtain a reform by means of 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11850 If they did not intend to submitthemselves to the established legislature of the country, their act was necessarily an act of usurpation of the sovereign power; and if they were simply devising the means by which the people, at any future time, were by their own power to do this for themsclves, it is exactly the same thing as if this Convention, had it been assembled, should themselves do it.—They would be only doing it more remotely; but they would be taking steps towards effecting their own original design— that of making a change in the existing government, by their own power, and not by the free power of the existing legislature — Gentlemen, if they had conceived this particular desizn, still I conceive their proceedings would have been equally destnictive to the existing government; for the mcans taken for the purpose, must be all tending to effect the pa plan which they had in view, and which they clearly meant te effect by their own strength, and not by any such applica. tion to the legislature as has been contended. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11852 King James having done that which occasioned a general rising of his subjects against him, he deserted the country, and an assembly was - called, under no regular authority, but under letters similar to those which had been used for the purpose of calling together the persons who were entitled to be summoned to parliament, and letters directed to the sheriffs of the several counties, to cause elections to be made by the persons entitled to vote for members tu be returned to parliament. That assembly met —in what character? It met as a convention of all the estates and degrees of the people; it acted as such ; its authority was acquiesced in, and it did all that was necessary for its particular purpose. The government of the country remained as it was, with the exception of one single circumstance—the throne was vacant—the Convention supplied that vacancy ; and from the moment it had supplied the vacancy, by declaring the prince and princess of Orange king and queen, from that Anstant, its character as a convention ceased ; it was no longer an assembly which represented the three estates of the realm, it was assumed by William to act as a regular parliament, and from that time acted as such, shaving before acted as a mere convention or assernbly of the three estates; in consequence of which, when acting as a parliament, it was commonly called the Convention Parliament. But in the act of giving the crown to thePtince of Orange, it acted with complete sovereign power, and acted in rebellion, if I May so term it, to James the 2nd; for he would have been completely deposed the mo‘Ment that convention assembled,. if he had not previously abdicated the throne ; and this aS a necessary consequence of assembling such a species of convention. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11858 do not they declare in that passage, that they consider every thing to which they can give the denomination of aristocracy, as their real enemics ; that they consider it as the bane of every nation under the sun; and, therefore, they conceived the French had acted wisely in expelling it from France? It must have been their opinion that it would be equally wise to expel’ it from this country. For what purpose could this address be presented to the French Con-: vention? There might be two purposes ; one that of publishing to the country here, in a way which they might fancy to be in some’ degree safc, a declaration against the existing government of the country; a sort of procla-’ mation of a republic; and another, a holding out to the French Convention, that they were: desirous of receiving every assistance from that. country which could possibly be given, for the purpose of enabling those who addressed them to establish the same constitution of gavernment in this country, as had been established in France. ’ The Address which was presented by the other society, the Society for Constitutional Information, is full as strong. You observe, the learned counsel for the prisoner have cautiously avoided taking any notice ofthisaddress, In truth, they were unable to give any explanation of it. How does this address begin? “ Servants of a Sovereign People, and Benefactors of Mankind,—We rejoice that your Revolution has arrived at that point of perfection, which will permit us to address you by this: title. The degree to which, as they conceive, a Revolution must arrive to be at its point of perfection, is, when those who have the administration of the government of the country, are to be addressed in the character: in which they thus address the French Con-: vention; that is, “Servants of a Sovereign People. What is this but a declaration, that the perfection 6f a Revolution in government, is the establishment of the principles, which we have before adverted to, of the Rights of. Man, and equal citizenship, and so on, ia which the people are to be considered as constantly sovereign as constantly exerting the sovereign authority, and as having a perpetual control over the whole government of the country; not an indirect and remote control; that species of control, which: is consistent with the stability of the gaovernment of a country; but that which leads, in its principle, to the sort of perpetual Revolution, upon which I have before observed ? The address proceeds, “ We rejoice that your Revolution has arrived at that point of perfection, which will permit us to address you by this title; it is the only one that can accord with the character of true legislators. Is not this a clear and express declaration, that they did not consider the legislature of this country, as having that title which could accord with the character of true legislators ? For no reform in the House of Commons; alone, could give to the legislators of this country, a title to that character, according to the idea of these persons upon the gubject. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11860 They add, “ Every successive epoch in your affairs has added something to the eels of Liberty ; and the glorious victory of the 10th of August, has finally prepared the way for a conStitntion, which, we trust, you will establish on the basis of Reason and Nature. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11865 « Your example will be soon followed? for nations, rising from their lethargy, will te claim the Rights of Man, with a voice which man cannot resist."—The Righits of Man, in this passage, are the Rights of Man as they are stated in Paine’s works; for ths society has expressly declared Paine's worss to be the foundation of all their proceediogs They have considered themselves as proceeting to establish the Rights of Man, as tsuz! by Thomas Painc.—ou must recollect par sages to this effect, in several instances— And, therefore, when they say, “ will re-claim the Rights of Man, with voice which m2 cannot resist, they must be taken to maa the Rights of Man, in the full extent of we doctrine laid down in Paine’s book. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11869 This society had laboured long in the cause, with little pruspect of success, previous to the commencement of your revolution. What is this but a declaration, that this society had, before the French revolution, been employing itself exactly upon the same Principles as those upon which the French revolution was -effected? “Conceive, then, their exultation of gratitude, when, by the astonishing efforts of your nation, they behold the reign of reason acquiring an extension and solidity, which promise to reward the labours of all good men, by securing the happiness of their fellow creatures. Now, if this society had made this Address to the National Assembly, which finished when they had formed the constitution of 1791, it might have admitted, in some degree, of a different construction; but they never addressed that assembly, which formed the constitution of 1791. Why? Because the assembly, which formed the constitution of 1791, had not brought the revolution to the point of perfection. That was the reason they never addressed that assembly. On the contrary, till the revolution of the 10th of August took. place, they had no idea of entering into this sort of correspondence with the French. They then make these Addresses to the French Convention, at the same time declaring, that, before this revolution, the society had employed itself on the same important object.— ‘“ Innumerable societies, of a similar nature, are now forming in every part of England, Scotland, and Ireland; they excite a spirit of universal inquiry into the complicated abuses of government, and the simple means of reform. After the example which France has iven, the science of revolutions will be renered easy. Now, how was this revolution effected in France? By an assembly of the people ; lawfully assembled under the authority of the king, but taking upon themselves of their own authority, to declare themselves a convention of the people. These are the means by which this revolution was effected ; from that moment the fate king of France was deposed; from that moment the late revolution began ; and from that point it proceeded to its present situation. “ After the example given by France, the science of revolutions will be rendered easy, and the progress of reason will be rapid. It would not be strange, if, in a period far short of what we should venture to predict, addresses of felicitation should cross the seas to a National Convention in England. Now, what is the meaning of a National Convention in England ? Is this to be understood of a meeting of people, for the purpose of petitioning pare liament for a reform of parliament? What can it mean but a convention, assuming all the powers of government, precisely as the. National Convention of France, at that time, did? Is it possible to conceive, that any other construction can fairly be put upon those words? And have they brought one single man of this society, for the purpose uf showing, that such is not the construction which ought to be put upon these words? 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11878  It then proceeds to that which is not very material, except that it proves that this societyin London were not content simply with ad dressing the French Convention themselves, but attempted to prevail upon all the other societies to do the same thing, which they considered as assisting the cause to avery! preat degree; and, in aletter from the prisoner imself, in the course of the transaction—I forget to whom it was directed, but it is a letter in which he mentions the subscriptionto the French—thet, in his opinion, a number of signatures was infinitely better than any sum of'money they could think of subscribing. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11880  Here you see, gentlemen, that this society at Stockport declare most clearly what they considered to be the object of such an address to the French; that they considered the cause of the French as their own cause, and likewise that of every individual person in Europe, not fattening on plunder.—“ We therefore think it highly necessary to add our friendly aid and assistance, in order to stimulate the oppressed friends of freedom in France, against all the despots in Europe (who are combined against the just and equal rights of man), by assuring them that we view their signal excrtions, and wonderful victories, with admiration; together with,—mark this, gentlemen — together with the extinction of treacherous royalty, and the restoring to every individual, his equal, indubitable rights, as fellowthe impression that it was necessary 10 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11883 The glorious victory of the 10th of August. Gentlemen, has not this society at Stockport declared its views in the most complete and airect terms! —The extinction of treacherous rovulty is here not pointed out ambiguously; oo pointed out by words which will admit of a different construction, but by words direct and plain; by words which require no com ment, to which no answer could possibly be given, and to which, therefure, my lesmed friends did not attempt to give any answer. Gentlemen, their silence upon that sub ject is conviction —If they could have got nd of the force and effect of this letter, ty would have done so.—You cannot curcene that it was through any want of ability—tha it was through any want of industry; fer Tam sure, when you heard, more especialis, what fell trom my learned triend who spoke last, you must acknowledge, that (althouzh not possessing, perhaps, all the ornaments of eloquence which distinguish some men, and yet possessing them tu a very considerable degree) as a judicious, as a forcible, and as 3 really able and convincing advocate, he bss not his superior. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11886 It seems impossible, when we advert to the contents of this ltter to have a doubt what were the obj the views and intentions of those ag 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11889 That letter is dated 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11891 The letter from Stockport was the 3d of November. This letter from Norwich, you will recollect, was made the subject even of debate in the meetings of the societies. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11895 The Norwich Society, therefore, thought that there was a sort of o! scurity in the declaration of the Sheffield people; in consequence of which, they began to apprehend that this Sheffield society did not mean to go the length which they intended. They say, that, from this declaration of the Sheffield people, they begin to apprehend that the Sheftield people seemed determined to support the duke of Richmond’s plan only.— The letter adds—“ But, since we find, in a printed letter received from them in a book, that they mean to abide by some moderate reform, as may hereafter be brought forward by the Friends of the People’—You will recollect, in the interval, the Society of the Friends of the People was established, which professed to have in view only a moderate reform; and which, likewise, if you may judge from the evidence that has been I ee atthe bar by some of the members of that society, never conceived even the duke of Richmond’s plan to come within the descri tion of a moderate reform, but always thought that plan wild and extravagant. The letter adds—“ which method is uncertain to us.— Here you find that the Friends of the People, and Society for Constitutional Information, do not exactly e; and you will re collect that the Friends of the People, and the Society for Constitutional Information, se very little agreed, that the Friends of the People had declared that they would have nothin; more to do with the Society for Constitution Information, because they saw clearly, that, in the transactions in which the Society for Constitutional Information were engagin; they had not in view a reform of the Come mons House of Parliament, but had in view, as the letter of the Friends of the People states, the accomplishment of what is termed “all Mr. Paine’s plans for public benefit ; including therefore, necessarily, the extinction of treacherous royalty, the extinction of aristocracy, and the establishment of perfect representation. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11906 This is not too strong a comment which I have made upon the words, “ those who wish for a full and equal representation of the people, and “leave toa parliament so chosen; because if you will look at the address of the London Corresponding Society, of the 6th of August 1792, they speak in clear, plain, and unequivocal language of a parliament so chosen, as that which is to accomplish all their purposes. When they referred therefore in this letter to their addresses—when in this letter they inserted this passage, the same idea pressed upon their minds—namely, that by a full and equal representation of the people, they meant a parliament chosen as they there state, they meant a parliament wholly elective, excluding & House of Lords, and you will observe, that in this address of the 6th of August 1792, they describe it accordingly as the people’s parliament. After taking notice of some things which I shail have occasion to observe upon presently, they say ‘“ numerous other teforms will undoubtedly take place even in the first session of a parliament so elected— that is of the whole parliament so elected— “depending only upon their electors, undivided by faction, uncorrupted by the minister, and uninfluenced but by the public good. Gentlemen, if their views went simply to the representation of the people, in the Commons House of Parliament, in what sense could they possibly have used these words? One paper retlects upon the other; it is clear and plain, that that only, which I have stated, could have been their intent. The letter proceeds, o preserve peace and good order among you, let no dispute be carried to excess. Leave monarchy, democracy, and even religion entirely aside. Never dispute on these tupics. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11908 Grant that it was 80; what does it prove, but that he observed the lesson which he taught to others, and which perhaps this ver Tetter might teach him the necessity of observing—“ to leave monarchy, democracy, and even religion entirely aside, never to dispute on these topics, but to let his endeavours go only toencreasing 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11917 It possesses their a opinion — Why? Because they have been taughtthink it ought to possess their good opinies; because it has been handed down to then by their forefathers; that it has, fora grat course of years, produced a greater portion of happiness to the people of the country, has been generally enjoyed under the gover ment of other countries.—Why it has so, very few men have the leisure, very few men have the ability, to inquire. Perhaps no man is capable’ of viewing it, in all its et tent, and all its consequences ; seeing all the minute parts of it, how they depend 00 upon the other, and how the moving or tering of any particular part may effect, in ils consequences, the whole. But we know that the result of the whole, combined, in po and practice, is, to a certain extent, good, Sreretorg we are arches to at har Lal tlemen, is unquestio: a of dice; but it is that sort of Pace Re by me every government is supported, and by alone a t can be supported—the 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11925 Mr. Paine says, he had conceived the idea of coming into this country, during the American war, keeping uiet till he could publish a book, which he ght would have had the effect of overturning the government of this country. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11931 In this view, all these pamphlets were written ; holding out, in the most glaring colours, every thing that was an abuse ; never once telling the people that they ought to consider what were the secret lets and diffieulties, which, ig all public proceedings, are innumerable and inevitable, and which, thereought to make all persons extremely cautious with respect even to the abuses of government, because, without very minutely attending to it, they may not be aware of those secret lets and difficulties which occasioned those very abuses, and which, perhaps, are absolutely inevitable, from the nature of things; from the constitutions of men; their habits, prejudices, passions, and a variety of other circumstances; all of which must be considered, when people consider, not only the constitution of the government, but the administration of that government. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11933 The persons who were employed in this country, seem to me to have conceived the idea of proceeding expressly upon the same principle. —You will recollect a letter, which I cannot immediately refer to, which says that the several societies ought to unite together, that they might act in unison ; observing that itwas by this means, that in France they finally obtained their eud.—You will recollect the letter to which I refer.—In the most expressterms, it declares, that these clubs were formed upon the very principle of the Jacobin club, and all those affiliated societies, and with the same view and intent, to make the whole mass co-operate as one entire body, in order ae to accomplish the object of their wishes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11936 One constant attendant was Mr. Horne Tooke. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11938 It was necessary to keep up the character and reputatice of this society, but at the same time to form another society, which should act in confor. mity to the plan which had been laid ; and with this view, it appears, that the London Corresponding Society was established by the prisoner, in conjunction with some other persons, he taking upon himself the character of secretary. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11941 They were to have from each division a delegate; the delegates formed a committee of delegates; and that committee of delegates was to be guided by the committee of correspondence; for, as their business was principally correspondence the Commitee of Correspondence necessarily had the management of almost every thing; 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11945 For, as in associating he gave up cer tain of his rights in order to secure the possession of the remainder, and! voluntarily yielded up only as much as was necessary for the general good, so he may not barter away the liberties of his posterity, nor desert the common cause, by tamely and supinely suffering to be purloined from the people, of whom he makes a part, their natural and unalienable rights of resistance (o oppression, and of shuring in the government of their country 3 without the fail and uninterrupted exercise of which rights, no man can, with truth, call himself or his country free. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11947 W hen, therefore, they declare their right of resistance to oppression, they declare their right of resistance to the existing government, which ri have declared to be an oppression; and all their proceedings are in direct conformity to that declaration. For the proceedings of the Scotch convention, and the resolutions of the twentieth of January, 1794, at the Globe-tavern, go upon this principle, the natural and unalienable right of resistance to oppression— So that they have only to call any act on the part of government oppression, and then, declaring their natural and unalicnable right of resistance to oppression, they declare their unalicnable right to resist that particular act. —They also declare their unalienable right of sharing in the government of their country —making use of the word government, as will be found in all their publications, instead of the expression in the duke of Richmond’s letter—“ sharing in the choice of those persons who are to make the laws by which they are to be governed. — The change is extremely remarkable, and is, in fact, a key to the whole. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11949 And their fourth resolution is, “ That the people of Great Britain are not effectually represented in parliament, not confining their resolution to the House of Commons ; and though certainly it is capable of that construction, yet that is not the natural construction of the words. Their seventh resolution is—“ That a fair, equal, and impartial representation can never take place till all partial privileges are abolished : — which seems a clear declaration of their mcaning.— For their first resolution is, “ ‘That every individual has a right to share in the government of that society of which he is a member, un less incapacitated ; which share in the government they could not possibly have, unless they had a voice at Icast in the eleetion of the persons who are to administer that government. — They fourthly resolve 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11952 And, in their seventh resolution, they say, “ That a fair, equal, and imPartial representation of the people in parliament, can never take place until all partial privileges are abolished ;—which partial privileges necessarily include the existence of the peerage as a part of the parliament. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11955 Men are to enter into a society in which they are to declare what are their principles upon government, and -yet the society pretends to be formed for the purpose of discussing those principles, 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11960 They could not possibly maa any such thing—they meant to establits tyranny of their own clubs—they meant establish these as assumed and positive pat ciples, not to be disputed—and which aloe were to govern all the deliberations of that Convention of the People, as they call it which they proposed to assemble. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11964 Does the spirit of the British constitution, in any degree, permit the choie by the pcople of the persons by whom te laws are to be administered? Can a moe clear and explicit declaration of an intented to form a republic be made than this; “t! the civil rights of every individual, are q lity of voice in the making of laws, and the choice of persons by whom these laws at 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11967 but what shall we say to men who carry the principle to this length—not content with denying that even a large majority of the country ought not to alter the established government of it, against the. consent of the minority, ; 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11977 will parliament grant them ? —will the nobles, or the clergy, ease the people’s suffering? No—experience tells us, and proclamations confirm it, that the interest and the intention of power, are combined to keep the nation in torpid ignorance. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11987 One referring to a subject, upon which I make no comment, but leave it to you to make acomment.—Upon the other I have ventured to make a comment.—It seems to me, that, by it, the title to all property is put in hazard, and I will call to your attention a part of the evidence which applies particularly to the subject. I allude to that part of Lynam’s evidence, with respect to the divisions in Spitalfields. 1 only wish you to bear that in mind now,—I mean particularly to notice it hereatter,—to bear in mind the relation which that evidence has to this passage. You will recollect, the Spitalfields divisions were considered as likely to produce as many members as all the then existing members of the society, and they were to be supported by assistance from the other divisions, because they were considered us persons of that description to whom the smal] subscriptions that were to be made, ofa penny a week, by other members of this society, might be inconvenient; and then judge, whether that which I have suggested, was not a part of the general plan. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11990 Apassage which, as I before observed, is utterly inconsistent with the existence of a House of Peers; referring to a parliament, which is described as wholly elected in the manner mentionedin this paper, and as dependent only on their electors, the poerls, the very object of the House of Peers eing to have a middle body in the constitution of the government, which should not be so elected, but being of a different description, should form a barrier between each of the two other powers, the King and the Commons, and keep the balance even between both, as one or other may preponderate. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 11998 It isa number of men, assembled by certain constitutions of union, by which those who are of themselves individuals, are enabled to act as one body. When therefore a society is established, and that society puts itself under particular Tegulations, that society, to a certain extent, though not bound in the same manner as a Corporation created by the lawful government, 1s in effect a corporation ; and when a number of societies unite themselves in the manner here Proposed, they are a union of distinct corporations, Corporations created by the Constitution and government of the country, acting under the authority of that constitution, are subordinate states. The East India 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12005 They did not assume to be a Convention of the People; they described themselves as a meeting of delegates of the different socicties asSociated for the purpose of ong a parliamentary reform—they met—they did their business—they dispersed and adjourned to meet again in November. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12007 I shall have occasion to observe something more upon the subject; but I would now observe, doubt but our society would, with pleasm, accept the invitation; and I ampersuade it woulddo much good. Our freedom, as yo: justly observe, depends entirely upon cuselves, and upon our availing ourselves uf th: opportunity, which, once lost, may nut be soon recovered.’—And I observe upon tis, because I think it tends to show, that, how ever unprepared they might be to carry te measures they had in view, into complete er ecution, they had a strong impression upa their minds, that, if they lost the opportunty, which to a certain degree they concerred they then had, they should not be able vn cover it again; and that therefore it waste cessary, at all events, to take some steps. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12009 This letter is communicated, not ctl; to the London Corresponding Society, bot t the Society for Constitutional Informatica; and in consequence of that communication. both these societies sent delegates to ths Scotch Convention—And, gentlemen, yu will recollect, that, by the communicata with Sheffield, Norwich, and other places, they were likewise induced to send 1o the same convention. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12013 This letter led to 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12018  Rational ‘and lawful wre ing the appellation or character of “ Conven-words which are capable of almost any (0
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12021 I now state it for the purpose of introducing the sending delegates to the Scotch Convention.—« If, in struction.—For, after it had been state 2 the report of their committee of constitsto:, that the minority had a right to resist the majority, for the pu of asserting, wist they call, their indefeasible rights, soot which they claim the right of equal, active citizenship; rational and la: messs sft any means which would be, according to bet idea of reason, rational, and, according to thet idea of law, lawful. They declare itto be lawful for the minority to resist the majesty, if the effect of the tyranny, as they callit, et ercised by the majority, were to deprive of their indefeasible civil rights; nemelf? share in the government of their coutty, both legislative and executive. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12029 The second is only supporting the opinion, that representatives in parliament ought to be paid by their constituents — an opinion formerly adopted, and acted upon, in this country, but long since abandoned, from a principle of policy, which is obvious; and the adoption of that opinion by the first constituent assembly in France, led, perhaps, toall the mischicf that followed. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12031  And therefore bier considered, that any act of parliament, and consequently any authority whatever, however in the common estimation of mankind it might be deemed lawful, was to be resisted by them, if it tended to prevent the execution of their purpose; and that, therefore, any means taken towards such resistance, were means taken for the purpose of obtaining annual parliaments, and universal suffrage, by rational and lawful means. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12033 And, if they considered resistance as lawful means, it necessatily also follows, that they considered attack as lawful means.—For, if resistance is lawful, an attack to supersede the necessity of resistance, is also lawful.—Upon what principle is attack in war lawful, but that resistance is justifiable ? And attack is justifiable for the purpose of a lia the necessity of that resistance—Therefore these instructions do 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12038 At the same time you will recollect, what my learned friend near me now suggests to me, that allthat was done in the Scotch Convention, in consequence of the instructions given to the delegates of the London Corresponding Society, was afterwards fully approved by the Society for Constitutional Information; and that one of the acts so done, was in direct conformity to those instructions (the seventh instruction) “ That it is the duty of the people to resist any act of parliament repugnant to the original principles of the constitution, as would be every attempt to prohibit associations for the purpose of reform. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12040  But what has this Constitutional Society done? Instead of disavowing any proceedingsof the British Convention, it has declared its approbation of them all; and the society has considered itself as bound to give the most effectual support to the persons who came to these resolutions. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12044 Gentlemen, I shall not go through all their proceedings because that would take up infinitely too large a portion of your time ; but there are some few of their proceedings upon which I shall venture to comment : In the first place I would notice their declaring themselves “ the British Convention of the People.—For the purpose which itis pretended they hadin view, that declaration was absolutely unnecessary—not only absoJutely unnecessary, but it was improper ; because if they were to convey to the parliament ofthe country, what the opinions of men were upon the subject, opinions conveyed by delegation are, in all cases, totally improper ; but opinions conveyed by delegation, where the persons specifically delegating do not appear, are still more improper. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12046 It woul also have been just within possibility, and nothin; more, that the delegates should convey the sentiments of those persons whe composed the several societies with respect to the subject of a reform in the House of Commons.— But it would have been certainly, a very incomplete method of conveying those sentiments.—For, you see, the delegate from the Society for Constitutional Information would have appeared to have conveyed the sentiments of Mr. Sheridan, and several other persons, whose names are still upon the books, as members of the Constitutional Society, though they have not attended the society for many years, and have really had nothing to do with it for several years.—Therefore these societies conld in fact, convey to parliament nothing more than the opinion of those Particular men who took active parts in the societies respectively ; and when their detegates in Scotland assumed to themselves the character of “ the convention of the people, and professed to convey the opinions of the people, they must have practised an imposition upon the parliament; for they were only a meeting of delegates, chosen by a few members of these societies, and had no right to represent themselves in the character of a Convention of the People, for the purpose of conveying to parliament the sentiments of the people of this country, as desiring a parliamentary reform. It was therefore not only Panes but absolutely improper, that they should assume the character of a Convention of the People.—For what purpose did they assume that appellution a—It could only be for the purpose of assuming the character of a convention of the people, and the power which is necessarily attributable to a real convention of the people? and, I conceive, that is the only purpose for which you will believe they did assume jt. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12049 But the evidence given of the conversations with Mr. Yorke, puts this beyond all sort of doubt : He said, “ The Brtish Convention split upon a rock—becmse they declared themselves a venared fe the people, before the people were prepared for it; that thet maak fret to have come forward with an address to the people at large;’"— That is, that they ought to have continued ia their original character ofa convention of de legates of the different societies, till, bya address to the people at large, they had pee pared the minds of the people at large for the declaration, that they were a convention the people, in order to obtain that sort of tacit consent to their declaration, which ms obtained in France, to a declaration of the same sort, by some of the members of the states-general.—Those persons, on the of June, 1789, being till then only membes of the states-general of the kingdom, s sembled under the authority of the king, according to the ancient constitution of France, and therefore, acting under that subordimtion to his authority which the ancient ao stitution of France required, declared theaselves a National Assembly ; and, THEREFOR, that the king could put no negative upon ther authority.—If they had not been supported by the people in that declaration, they could not have acted in the character in which they thea assumed to act; but the people did them, and the public mind being pre| support them as a convention ef the and to give them all the force, the strength, and efficiency of such a convention, from that time, they did act as a convention of the pecple, assembled by sufficient authority; from that time, they were completely the vereign power of the state. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12052 What the purposes of Margarot and Gerrald were, we have had clearly before us upon evidence. What was the purpose of Mr. Yorke, who, though a delegate from the Constitutional Society, did not actually go,— we may infer, from all that he did and said elsewhere. Now, that the whole is disclosed, and all its complex parts are put together, it is clear that this very act was, initself anact of High treason—And I beg to say, that the Attorney General, in his place in the House of Commons, on the question relative to the trials in Scotland, declared, that as far as he could then view it, seeing it imperfectly as he did, he was inclined strongly to think, that it ought to have been soconstrued. But an act may be an act of high treason, or an actof sedition, merely, according to the degree of evidence which may be produced upon the subject. Unless you can show, what was the object of the parties, you ma: Not be able to prove it to be an act of hig treason, although, in fact it was so. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12056 It that which has appeared in evidence here, had appeared to them, I think, according to the evidence which would then have been before them, they must have considered the acts as amounting to high treason; and it would have been their duty to have taken care that the persons, guilty of those acts, should hare been prosecuted accordingly. But from the evidence before them, the complete criminal intent did not appear, and therefore they proceeded, according to the law of Scotland, for the crime of sedition. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12069 I wish to know, how the le counsel for the prisoner, whom I do not w see in court—I wish he was here—I mean, my learned friend who addressed you last, with great force, with great energy, and certainly with a considerable degree of ability— how he reconciles these resolutions, so left in blank upon the minutes, with the principle upon which he stated this convention to have acted.—He did not, indeed, distinctly state this convention to have acted upon it; he rather suggested the principle, and then endeavoured to slur the matter over, to pass it Ly, asserting, that, whatever might ve imputed to this convention, it could not affect that which was to have been assembled, and the prisoner had nothing to do with it. Gentlemen, you will recollect the solemnity with which the transactions relative to these resolutions were carried on; that, “ After an excellent discussion of the question, pertinent remarks and amendments, the convention was resumed, and the whole, as amended, heing read over, the members stood upon their feet, and passed the resolutions, unanimously, as follows."—Y ou will recollect, likewise, that this was preceded, in the course of the debate, by citizen Brown's siving a history of the Habeas Corpus Act, and therefore appearing to take an important part in the discussion of the question, Mr. Matthew Campbell Brown, who was the delegate trom Sheffield, and who has been stated as the Editor of the Patriot—There is a blank in the minutes, for these resolutions; and then the minutes import, that, “ After the said resolution, agreed to, and solemnly approved of, as above, citizen Gerrald, in an energetic and animated specch, addressed the meeting, and expressed his happiness at the motion passed, and exposed the act of the Irish parliament, called a Convention Bill; and citizen Brown followed him, in a manly speech, and proved the influence of the executive government over the parliament ;—and then, Citizen Margarut read and proposed a motion :--hat a Secret Committee of three, with the secretary, be appointed to determine the Place where such Convention of Emergency shall meet; that such place shall remain a secret with them, and with the secretary of this convention; and that each delegate shall, at the breaking up of the present session, be entrusted with a sealed letter, containing the name of the place of mecting; that this letter shall be delivered, unopencd, to his constituents, the receipt of which shall be acknowledged by a letter to the secretary, preferved in the same state, until the period shall arrive, at which it shall be deemed necessary jor the delegates to set off. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12072 So that now they would have been in actual rebellion, as the bill for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act did pass ; —“ or the act for preventing wrongous imprisonment, and against undue delays in trials, in North Britain; or in case of an invasion, or the admission of any Salen troops whatsoever, into Great Britain or Ireland; all, or any of these calamitous circumstances, shall be a signal to the several delegates to repair to such place as the Secret Committee of this convention shall appoint. Throughout all their proceedings you find a Secret Committee. There is no one of the proceedings of any of these societies which you have had before you, in which you have not found a Secret Committec; that is, a few persons, who keep secret from the rest all the important proceedings, and guide and direct the whole. The formation of a Secret Committee being, necessarily, the formation of a thing which they conceive would not bear the open light of day, and particularly would not bear the eye of the existing government of the country, bound to keep and support the peace of the country,; “ and the first seven members shall have power to declare the sittings permanent, and twentyone shall constitute a convention, and proceed to business. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12075 Then they resolved, which shows clearly what they meant by the other part of the resolution, “ That the moment of any illegal dispersion of the present convention, shall be considered as asummons to the delegates to repair to the place of meeting, appointed for the Convention of Emergency, by the Secret Committee, and that the Secret Committee be instructed to proceed, without delay, to fix the place of meeting. So that, without delay, this Secret Committee were immediately to proceed to fix upon some place, at which this assembly of people were to meet, if they should be dispersed by the superior power of government; and at which place, therefore, they were necessarily to meet, in opposition to the existing government of the country. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12091 “ It is unNecessary to ettempt to lop off the branches while we are. endeavouring to cut down the tree. You cannot fill up the blank in any other way. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12094 A meeting upon this was held, and a. variety of proccedings took place, in London, all tending to assemble another convention, expressly declaring, that in consequence of the dispersion of the British Conventivn,. they were determined to assemble another. For the proceedings had not arrived at that ripeness which could enable them to carry intoexecution, the plan of that convention of emergency, which they had suggested in the minutes of the convention in Scotland, because that could not have been completely carried into effect with respect to England, unless they had had a greater proportion of delegates from England, than they actually had. Finding that impracticable, they turned their minds to the assembling another British Conventionin England, and they openly avowed their intention of assembling that convention in England. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12097 “ The brave defenders of liberty, South of the English Channel, are performing wonders: driving their enemies before them, like chaff before the whirlwind. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12116 When we read their proceedings, is not the whole of their conduct a tissue of conspiracy—of sedition— of treason and rebellion against the government of the country ?—And yet these ave the actions which the London Corresponding Society think proper to call virtuous actions— which the Society for Constitutional Information describes as that which entitled them to the approbation of all wise, and the support of all brave men.—Persons who so declare themselves with respect to the proceedings of such an assembly as the British Convention assembicd at Edinburgh, declare themselves adverse to all government; not only to the existing government, but, it seems to me, to government. If individuals may s0 act with impunity, it is impossible for any government to exist. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12118 No—“ in a house of real national representatives :""—Here is an express declaration, that they do not mean a reform in the House of Commons: it isa declaration, that they associate in order to obtain a fuir, free, and Sull representation of the people in a house of real nutional representatives.—Why do they declare this now ?—Why ! because they find that now was the time or never, as Mr. Hardy expressed it in his letter, for them to do something worthy of men, when the French were driving their enemies before them, like chaff before the whirlwind.—They proceed—“ Are we also willing to be treated as felons, for claiming this, our inherent right, which we are determined never to forego, but with our lives, and which none but thieves and traitors ean wish to withhold from us?—Gentlemen, these inherent rights they declare, in their committce of constitution, to be, the right of every citizen, not only to a share in the egislatice, but in the executive government of the country. That right could only be exercised by the creation of a representative gowernment; and here they declare, they “ as-ociate in order to obtain a fair, free, and full Tepresentation of the people, in a house of real national representatives ; and ‘ that th 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12123  In the very moment that they slander the government of the country by those expres sions, they clearly declare their meaning— They assert that the government of the coentry has in contemplatien to oppress them by force, and that the government of the coun try having formed that intention to oppress them by force, they are determined also te use force—“ There 1s no farther step beyond that which they have taken—VW are at 1s8un? We must now choose at once, either hiberty or slavery, for ourselves and our posterity."— And they declare that they would not wait till the government should take more efiectual steps for the of restraining them. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12125 “ You may ask, perhaps, by what means shall we seck redress ? We answer, that men in a state of civilized society, ere bound to seek redress of their grievances from the laws, as long as any redress can be obtained by the laws; but our common masaes, whom we serve (whose law is a law of liberty, and whose service is perfect freedom) has taught us not to expect to gather grapes from thorns, nor figs from thistles — We MUST HAVE REDRESS FROM OUR OWN Laws, aD NOT FROM THE LAWS OF OUR PLUNDERERS, ENEMIES, AND OPPRESSORS. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12127 We answer, that men in a state of civilized society, are bound to seek redress for griew ances by law, as long as any redress can be obtained by law; but, when all laws are violated, then that compact by which civilized society is kept together, is dissolved, and we bave a right to act for ourselves—That is the char interpretation of the first part—They add, “ But how can we expect to gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles.— What do they mean by thorns and thistles? Why the king and the parliament—They assert that they could not expect any redress from them, or at least from the parliament, because they could not expect to gather grapes from thorns, nor figs from thistles.—“ We must have redress, therefore, they say, from our own laws, and not from the laws of our plunderers, enemies, and oppressors. — What does this mean, but that they must have redress from a Convention of the People; for this is an address to the people.— “ We, therefore, must mean “ the people. and “ our own laws, must mean “ the luws of the people.’—We, the people, must have redress from our own laws, and not from the jaws of our plunderers, enemies, and opPressors—characterizing, by thuse terms, the constituted authorities of the country.—And they add, “ There is no redress for a nation circumstanced as we are, but in a fuir, free, and full representation of the people. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12129 The fair, the free, and full representation of the people, which they describe, has been so over and over again explained, in their own publicaions, and in their resolutions and addresses ; in the report of their committee of constitution, and elsewhere; that it is utterly unne cessary for me to go over that ground agai but merely to observe, that, by a fair, os and full representation of the people, they clearly and unquestionably mean, on all occasions, a perfect representation of the people, as they sometimes ble it; namely, a representation of the people, in an assembly which should act as a National Convention, like the National Convention of France, by means of which, every citizen should have the right of sharing in the government of the country, legislative and executive.—Then. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12133 I do nut mean to say, that alll the consequences were immediately to fullow ; that the king of the country was tu be considered, as from that moment, depused.— This appears to be rather a proclamation that there shall be such a government; not that it shall instantly take place, but that it shade be established, and that they will take steps for the purpuse.—And you will remember, that, in the case of treason, a plan once formed, und steps taken in pursuance of it, is sufficient tu constitute treason; and it is not necessary that the steps should be effectual for the purpose. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12157  We have a central situation in our view, which we believe would be most convenient for the whole Island, but which we forbeas to mention (entreating your confidence in this particular) till we have the answer of the societies with which we are in correspondence. gentlemen, the place of meeting of this convention was to continue a secret. And here is another instance of that secrecy which we find throughout every measure, and which most clearly demonstrates that their intentions were not honest. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12172 He said, that the revolution, at least so far as it recompromise between the king and the aristocracy, for the jeint inheritance of the peoples but to establish, on unequivocal Sa les, the right of the people, to govern themselves, end to recall those delegated powers which they had entrusted to their servants for this purpose, ‘when they were either abused, or neglected to exercise them. If the revolu-tion were not a revolution for the people, it was no revolution at all, but a conspiracy of a few-ennobled oppressors, against the liberties and happiness of the many.—But, if it were designed ‘to comprehend the whole, and its end has been perverted, or purposely laid aside, the people are not warranted in petitioning, but are justified in demanding, us a right, 3 ly to the tone of language used in the declaration of rights, the restitution ofannual parliaments, and the establishment of universal suffrage. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12175 Then, as a sort of colour of their proceedings, and as the means of exciting discontent, a long petition was prepared for the abolition of the slave trade. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12177 And you cannot form the slightest reason to believe, that a petition to the House of Commons was within their view. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12192 I feel myself unable to sv any thing more, though I am well indeed I well recollect, there are many things I meant to have stated, which I mre er, give your verdict, according the truth of the evidence laid before you. Sif that shoud enable you to give a verdict of acquittal, 1 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12197 I leave it entirely to the discretion of your lordship; and Mr. Hardy desires me to state his confidence in the justice of the Court, and to express his acquiescence in the mode your lordship proposes. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12199 If, in summing ups there is any paper I should not state, which the counsel on either side, and particularly the counsel for the prisuner, should think may throw light on what I do state, if they will be ood as to put me in mind of it, as I goon, certainly be read. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12202 The first overt act charges “ their meeting, consulting, conspiring and agrecing to cause and procure a convention and meeting of the king’s subjects to be assembled within the kingdom, with intent, and in order that the persons so to be assembled, might, without and in defiance of the authority, and against the will of the Parliament, subvert, alter, and cause to be subverted an altered, the legislature, rule and government now established, and to depose, and cause to be deposed, the king from the ory state, title, power and government thereof.The second overt act charges him with “ writing composing and publishing (the more readily and effectually to assemble stich convention for the traitorous purposes aforesaid, and thereby to accomplish the same) divers books, pamphlets, letters, instructions, resolutions, orders, declarations, addresses, and writings, purporung, and containing therein, incitements, encquragements and exhortations, to move, is induce and persuade the king’s subjects to choose, depute, and send, and cause to be chosen, deputed, and sent, persons, as delegates, to compose and constitute such convention.

UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12237 tle says, that a gentleman, from Halifax read the lec ture, and that the pamphlets were sold, but they had not a very extensive sale; the witness himself composed a prayer that was used upon the occasion; the copy was delivered to the printer, and it was settled, at a private meeting of some of the members, that it should be so printed. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12239 I have only to observe, at present, upon this paper, that, as to the general libellous turn of it, nothing very material to the present question ariscs, but that there is one passage in the petition, which may be very material for your consideration, where he talks of an impending storm, connecting that with the date, which is the seventh of Apri], 1794, it may be hereafter matter for your consideration. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12260 he says, there was a mecting at the Castle-hill on the seventh of April, 1794; abuut that time there was a conversation about providinz themselves with arms; that Davison, whe was spoken of, who worked for Gale, aprhed to him to make pikes; the witness madea peuera for him, which was approved of; be had the iron on Davison’s credit, and Davisoa was to pay him for the making—he saw Davison atterwards at Camage’s—he sent to Yorke, but Yorke had just received an account of Mr. Walker's trialat Manchester, in which he was much interested; he was very much overjoyed on that account, and he would not talk about these pikes—he said, he saw one after that, which was finished, Yorke bad it ua his hand, but he did not converse about it, he was only playing with the children—he says, he made a hundred and thirty pikes for Davison; he had two-pence apiece for workmanship—he says, he saw Davison’s letter; that Davison said, he did not know but they might have the same occasion for pikes in London as they had in Sheftield, if they were attacked by any unlawful set of men, that they might defend themselves. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12263 The society consisted in the whole, if all assembled, of six hundred; and the rest, according to his account, were the mere populace assembled, many of them probably could not hear any thing that passed. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12267 He says, that there were dragoons in the neighbourhood of Sheffield; that he saw a model of a night-cat; he asked the use of it, carnage said, it was an instrument to throw int street to prevent horses travelling, and from the appearance of it he thought it might have that effect; he said, he did not recollect that the man mentioned any town where they had been used.—He saw a few pikes brought into Camage’s by another man — that Davison asked him to let a letter or two be directed to his house for him, Davison. — : Upon his cross-examination he says—he was not a member at the time the delegates went to Scotland—he never heard that an night-cats in fact were made, but that this thing, which seemed to he a model, lay in the shop open, he says, he never heard any thing said against the RIDE? that he himself was a friend to the king; that he believed the king to be a good man, and it would be a crime to do any thing against a good man, that is a very good idea as far as it goes, but in fact it is not that description of loyalty to the prince which the occasion seemed to call for. He says, there was no talk of pikes till after the threats had been made use of—he says, he made two dozen and nine handles, and Widdison made a few more, and that is all he knows of; that these were made two or three weeks before the volunteer company were raised at Sheffield; and he says, that their apprehension was, that these pcople might take upon themselves to disperse the meeting, without any magistrate being present, or sending any legal authority for it. The next witness is John Edwards, a silversmith, a young man, who was a member of the London Corresponding Society.—He says, he knew that the prisoner was secretary to that society, and he received from bim a direction to a man at Sheffield. In the month of April, 1794, he went to Mr. Hardy, to desire that he would enclose a few lines to a person at Sheffield who could inform him of some persons who could forge blades for ikes; and then Hardy read part ofa letter to im, and gave him a direction to a person; that the plan was, to forge blades there for the people at Shefheld—the witness says—I spoke to two or three members of the Corresponding Society, and I understood that several of tent wished to furnish themselves with pikes. “ He says, that a meeting was to have taken place on the Friday before the prisoner was aken up, at the Parrot, in Green Arbour Court, in the Old Bailey, where every one was to lay down his money, and then the blades were to he sent up from Sheftield, and each was to pay a shilling.—He says, he belonged to the twenty-ninth division; he was sometimes present at the twenty-second. He was asked if he knew persons of the name of Gosling, Hillier, Baxter, and Spence ; he said yes, that the two last were delegates to some division: he mentioned the circumstance of pikes to Baxter, Spence, and Hillier. He understood from some of the members that there was a place in the Borough where they might learn the use of the musket; that he knew two persons of the name of Higgins and Goodwin who were members of the Constitutional Society; that Goodwin told him of the place: and that he had heard at his division something of the association by Franklow, called the Lambeth Association— he saw Franklow, in a blue coat and red collar, with white waistcoat and breeches, at the dinner at the Globe tavern, on the 20th of January, 1794. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12270 He says, it was suspected that come person had given information who it was that had been chosen of this committee, and that Lynam was the person who was suspected; and the committee which was dissolved had power to elect a new one; that Martin, Thelwall, Baxter, Moore, Hodgson, or Lovett, were elected the secret committee ; that they received letters, and every thin -was left to them what they should do wit! them, it was kept a secret from the society— sometimes they read letters at the division. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12272 The Corresponding Society deputed five persons to attend the Constitutional Society, who pg six persons; afterwards they met ; that there was a debate about the wwitness’s age at the general committee of delegates, Thelwall and Baxter spoke upon that debate ; there was a debate, also, about the medals which were to be presented to the jury who had acquitted Eaton. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12275 There was a kind of trap-ball ground they met in, which was connected with the long room; they found some of the members of the Corresponding Societs ther ; he particularly mentioned Moore, Hodgson, Thelwall, Lovett, and Richter — Lovett was called to the chair—He does not recollect whether Mr. Hardy was there or no.—He says, there were two ladies there he was srquainted with, he went up with them into the long room, and they were locked in, therefor he could not see so well—he could give no report of the proceedings at Chalk-farm—he dves not recollect ever hearing the proceedings at Chalk-farm reported to the committee, or any of the societies, because most of the members heard it there. He says, he knows Robins’s Coffee-house, that is where the division number twenty-nive met; he was formerly a member of that div sion.—He says he received about this time of the meeting at Chalk-farm a paper from Baxter, about the size of the paper produced, and he believes it to be the same as the paper produced.—That paper must be read. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12279 He says, that there was a meeting upon the 2d of May, 1794, at the Crown and Archer-tavern, at which he was present, having a ticket given him by Mr. Joyce for the anniversary dinner; that the address from the Globe-tavern was read before dinner at that meeting, and distributett afterwards; the paper which he spoke of, he received at the Three Tuns on Snow-hill, which was after the 20th of January: therefore, I apport that paper was the address from the Globe-tavern, according to his former evidence, he says, he has been at Thelwall’s lectures—that a a of pikes was to bea shilling for each blade. d 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12284 He says he knows Hillier; that he had a pike, but not of the same construction as his. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12289 He says that his society met without the use of any weapons for two years previous to that time; but he heard that a division in Bunhill-row had been often interrupted by the police officers. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12337 By the constitution of this society it is divided into a great number of subdivisions, us many as they have opportunity to make, consisting of not less than thirt members in a sub-division ; each of these divisions choose a delegate to represent them in a general committee of these delegates; -which general committee of delegates act for the society at large; and all such matters as are thought proper to be communicated te the divisions, are brought back to each diviSion by the delegate of that division, and communicated there.—That is the way in which this machine is framed and carried on. The witness says, upon October he was at the division, number twelve, at the Crown in Newgate-street, when the Address to the French Convention was read, it having been brought forward before at a committee of delegates. On the second of November, at the Rainbow, in Fleet street, there was a meeting of division, number eleven. There was a report that the society at Stockport had written to Sheffield, that they approved of the different meetings. There was a letter, which was a pretty long one, in which it was said, that it would be a god thing to send, as he understood it, the ndon delegates down to teach the farmers pl this letter was by the editors of the heffield paper, intituled the Patriot, and this was written to the delegates; this is afterwards produced, and it corresponds with the witness’s note; it is much fuller than his note, but as far as his note does go, it corresponds Hstiy much to the paper; only instead of sending delegates from London to teach the farmers politics, the proposition was, that the societies should send delegates from their respective societies into the country in order to enlighten the minds of the people, He says, there were six honorary members of the London Corresponding Society admitted to the society at the Crown and Anchor. A certificate of Hardy’s election to be a delegate was then produced; it was a paper found in his possession. Lynam then went on with his evidence : he gays, he-was ata meeting upon the twelfth the thirty-first of of November, at the Unicorn, of division number two; there were very loud plaady at the reading a letter from Barlow to the azvention of See ool says, it was either

Conventsa in France, had been ordered to be published in France, and sent to the eighty three departments in France.—The society at Shef field had sent up their address to the com mittee of delegates, who had forwarded it the National Convention of France. The next meeting was on the twenty-first of November, of the division number twelve, at the Crown, in Newgate-street; there was a talk of a congress to be held in Scotland—A charge, which had been delivered by Mr. Justice Ashhurst to the grand jury, was read. —It was reported that the society at Norwich wanted to know if they meant to come into the duke of Richmond’s plan, or to np up monarchy; they suspected this was to draw them into some unguarded expressions, and declined answering.

UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12350 tle says, he went, but he has no memorandum of any thing that passed.—On the eleventh of December lhe was at the division, number twentythree ; it was reported there, that the London Corresponding Societies’ rules had been introduced among thesoldiers.—It wasreported that the Irish had been scouted as we hadbeen, and that they had applied to the council, who had declared their meetings to be legal; that he understood by that, the privy council. —He says, their funds were low, and the divisions were recommended to subscribe to the publication of the Address; three of this division offered to stick the Address up about the town. It was reported, that Baxter, who was a delegate of the division, number sixteen, was at the meeting at Shoreditch church, and that he opposed that meeting, and that he was laid hold of; and in consequence of that, seeing that he could not resist, he threw some of the Societies’ Addresses among the people assembled there; and he complained he was very ill-used, his coat torn, and he was struck several times in the church-yard; he said, it was a meeting to support the constitution. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12352 It was reported, that the magistrates were after Littlejohn.—One Field was chosen assistant secretary. —There was a motion from the division, number four, that a letter should be wrote to the Common Council. He says, that Ridgway was to publish Margarot’s letter to Mr. Secretary Dundas: the project was, that this letter was to be written and carried to the post office hy Margarot and two others. —The letter was dated the fourth of December, 1792; and that they might be sure it was sent, they took a receipt from the post office. The letter to Mr. Secretary Dundas was read, recommending areform, and to protect them fom all interruption.—That letter must be read,

There wasa letter, dated the fifteenth, from Paisley, expressin their willingness to correspond with us, an mentioning twelve societies formed in August for a parliamentary reform. There was a letter from Edinburgh, of the eleventh of December, to call a convention of all Scotland, to be of the same opinion, and the title of the Society was—“ The Friends of the People— Archibald East Hodge, president; William Read, secretary.

Edward Oakes, a plater at Sheffield, says, he has been a member of the society, from 1791 to the present time; he says, he attended the meeting, that his object was, to procure, by lawful and constitutional means, in co-operation with the rest of the societies, a reform in parliament; they expected their petitions would be heard, when made by large bodies, that it would be more likely to impress the parliament; that it was never their object to use force; he says, he would not have remained in the society if that had been their object; they had no object, but a reform in the House of Commons, and that by petition.

UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12507 disastrous engagements to end in ruin! If we understand this to relate to any political engagements into which this country had entered, and which might end ill, the people would not have to provide for themselves; that would not dissuive the government. What does he mean, therefore, when he talks of. these disastrous engagements, which are to issue in ruin, when the people are to provide for themselves? 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12509 Does the writer mean: this, or what does he mean? He gues on—“ We will not need but to be prepared for the event, to stand and see the salvation of the Lord. Let us, therefore, take the hint given us by our oppressors ; let us begin, in earnest, to make up our minds relative to the extent of reform which we ought to seek. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12515 I maean the speech of Barrere on the subject of a national convention; in which he takes a great deal of pains to show, that it isa thing perfectly consistent with an established government.—That a national convention was the authority of the A seg at large, which might consist with the established governments of all countries. The use that might be made of this doctrine, by those who wished to reconcile the people to a national convention as a constitutional measure, is apparent, and the probable consequences of ouch a convention not less apparent. And here it is fit that I should take some notice to you of a circumstance not wholly unconnected with this pat of the subject: It was observed to you y the leading counsel on the part of the prisoner (to whom I am always desirous of paying attention), and the observation was repeated, that a people had a right to alter their government. That proposition, under certain circumstances, may be true; but it ought not to have been introduced into a court of justice, bound to administer the law of the existing government, and to suffer no innovation upon it, I did not interrupt the learned counsel when he stated this proposition, because I did not wish to stop him, or to disconcert the chain of his argument; but having passed it by upon that occasion, I feel it my duty to notice it now, because it can have no relation to the business before us, because it tends to unsettle men’s minds, to bring on a thirst for innovations, and to shake all the foundations of ppemanpent, proceed to take notice why Barrere’s exposition of a convention ought not to press the risoner; it came over to this country in the oniteur, and though it was ordered to be entered in the books of the Constitutional Society, yet it does not appear that it ever was translated into English, and therefore it was extremely probable the prisoner never had an opportunity of knowing Barrere’s sentiments on that subject, But it is otherwise with re
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12529 There is a piece of parol evidence, which respects this point fit to be stated—Lynam says, that at one of their meetings, Bell observed that their address to the National Convention in France, proved that they meant to introduce their laws here to which Mr. Margarot said, no doubt. The other persons present said nothing, Hardy was present and this passed at a mceting of the delegates; if therefore he had no doubt, and if the nature of the transactions countenances that opinion, and if the transactions taken together should be irreconcileable to the other opinion, then there is a weighty evidence for your consideration, to prove the whole extent of the proposition as it is stated on the part of the prosecution. 
UNKNOWN_WITNESS 12542 He is also represented by Mr. Francis, as appearing to him to be deeply engaged in this business of a parliamentary reform, and sincerely desirous of obtaining it, in the regular course, by petition to the tlouse of Commons; and it appears that he hroughta petition to Mr. Francis, as from the society to which he belonged, to be by him presented to parliament.—This was m May, 1793.—The petition, I should add, was on the plan of the duke of Richmond; and it may be true, that this plan may have received countenance from the protest which has been read to you from the Lord’s Journals, made by a great number of the lords in parliament, and containing sentiments which, if you suppose it to have fallen into the hands of inferior men, who happen to be eager enthusiasts, certainly might have great weight with them.—But, gentlemen, you will observe what the duke of Richmond’s plan and the protest go to; if a question were to arise, whether, in a clear case of a project, strictly according to the duke of Richmond’s plan, and strictly according to the protest, any crime could be fastened upon the assembling a convention for the purpose of promoting the Project, these sentiments would have their weight : Here the application fails ; nobody can suppose that eit mond’s plan, or the language of the protest, goes in the smallest degree to countenance aconvention for the purpose of introducing a er the duke of Richdemocracy into the country, which is the purpose now imputed to this prisoner. ceeding of the same nature with the British }
